## **Gameplay Mechanics**

### **Contextual Menu System**

Central to the player’s interaction with *Project Chimera* is the **Contextual Menu System**, which adapts based on the selected mode (Construction, Cultivation, or Genetics). Each mode has its own distinct icon in the top corner of the screen, allowing players to switch between modes by clicking the icon or using assigned hotkeys. The menu itself appears as a wide rectangular UI element at the bottom of the screen, consistent in layout across all modes but differentiated by color to indicate the active mode.

* **Tabs and Sub-Tabs**: The menu is organized into tabs for easy navigation. For example:

  * In **Construction Mode**, tabs include “Rooms” (for structural components like walls and roofs), “Equipment” (with sub-tabs for lights, HVAC, irrigation, etc.), and “Utilities” (for electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems).

  * In **Cultivation Mode**, tabs include “Tools,” “Environmental Controls,” and “Plant Care.”

  * In **Genetics Mode**, tabs include “Seed Bank,” “Tissue Culture,” and “Micropropagation.”

* **Item Display**: Options within tabs are shown as small graphics with their cost or, if already owned, the quantity in inventory. Unaffordable options are greyed out.

* **Inventory Management**: Players can keep old equipment in inventory and sell it at a reduced price based on wear and tear. Degradable items (e.g., lights, pumps) lose value over time and must eventually be replaced.

This system ensures intuitive access to the tools and resources needed for each aspect of the game, while maintaining a clean and immersive interface.

### **Construction and Building**

Construction is the cornerstone of *Project Chimera*, empowering players to craft their ultimate grow facility. Starting with a small, empty warehouse bay (approximately 15’x15’x10’), players build and expand their operation over time.

#### **Key Features:**

* **Modular Design**: Players use a grid-based system to place walls, doors, rooms, and equipment, offering precise control and endless customization.

* **Utility Management**: Essential systems like electricity, water, and airflow must be installed and maintained:

#### **Schematics System**

Schematics allow players to save and replicate facility setups, from entire warehouses to individual plant configurations:

* **Creation**: Players select components using a drag-to-select system (similar to 3D modeling software), with the ability to toggle categories (e.g., plumbing only) for precise control.

* **Exclusion of Genetics**: Genetic components (plants, seeds) are automatically excluded from schematics.

* **Sharing and Trading**: Schematics can be published to the online marketplace, where players set prices in Skill Points. Buyers must still pay in-game currency for the materials when using the schematic.

* **Usage**: Schematics provide a blueprint for quick construction but require the player to have sufficient in-game currency for the components.

### **Cultivation**

Cultivation is the operational core, where players grow cannabis plants through a realistic lifecycle.

#### **Key Features:**

* **Plant Care**: Manage irrigation, fertilization, pest control, and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, light, CO2).

* **Growth Stages**: Plants progress through seedling, vegetative, and flowering phases, each with unique needs.

* **Environmental Controls**: Adjust light spectrum, intensity, and other factors to optimize growth.

* **Plant Work**: Perform tasks like pruning, training, and defoliation to influence yield and quality.

* **Harvesting and Processing**: Decide when to harvest, then dry, cure, and process the crop.

* **Menu System**: The contextual menu in Cultivation Mode includes tabs for tools, environmental controls, and plant care items, allowing players to select and use resources efficiently.

#### **Continuous Operation:**

Unlike phased gameplay, cultivation operates continuously. Players can dedicate facility sections to different stages (e.g., vegetative rooms, flowering rooms), enabling weekly harvests and steady income. This mirrors real-world commercial grows, adding realism and complexity.

#### **View Mode:**

* **Cultivation Mode**: The default, real-world view for plant care and facility management, designed for immersion. The menu provides access to tools and controls relevant to cultivation tasks.

### **Genetics and Breeding**

Genetics is the creative and scientific pinnacle, allowing players to craft unique cannabis strains.

* **Breeding Mechanics**: Cross plants to create hybrids, with outcomes driven by dominance and variation.

* **Pheno-Hunting**: Grow multiple plants from a strain to select the best phenotypes.

* **Seed Bank**: Store and manage a genetic library tied to the player’s account.

* **Tissue Culture**: Preserve genetics in a stable, long-term form without continuous cultivation. Accessible via a dedicated tab in the Genetics Mode contextual menu, this mechanic allows players to create tissue cultures from their plants, maintaining a library of strains for future use or trading.

* **Micropropagation**: Rapidly multiply genetics to produce multiple clones from a single sample. Available as a tab in the Genetics Mode contextual menu, this feature enables players to scale up production or experiment with different growing conditions efficiently.

* **Blockchain Integration**: Ensures genetic uniqueness and security, integrated invisibly via gameplay actions.

* **Menu System**: The contextual menu in Genetics Mode includes tabs for “Seed Bank,” “Tissue Culture,” and “Micropropagation,” displaying the player’s genetics inventory. Unavailable (discovered but out-of-stock) genetics are greyed out. Players cannot purchase genetics from the in-game marketplace; they must cultivate and maintain their stock.

#### **Advanced Genetics System**

The genetics system in *Project Chimera* is a sophisticated blend of complexity, realism, and security, designed to mirror real-world cannabis breeding while introducing innovative gameplay mechanics. It leverages fractal mathematics and blockchain technology to create a dynamic and secure breeding simulation.

* **Complexity**:

  * The system employs fractal mathematics to generate an infinite variety of genetic patterns, ensuring no two strains are identical unless intentionally cloned. Each breeding operation combines parental genetics with mutation seeds and harmonic interference patterns, producing offspring with unique trait profiles.

  * Players interact with a deep system where traits like THC content, yield, and terpene profiles are calculated through recursive fractal algorithms. The complexity scales with trait heritability—highly heritable traits (e.g., CBD content at 96%) show less variation, while environmentally sensitive traits (e.g., stress tolerance at 40%) offer greater diversity.

  * Harmonic interference introduces realistic sibling variation, mimicking F2 generation diversity (60% moderate, 30% significant, 0.5% exceptional variation), calibrated from cannabis research data.

* **Realism**:

  * The genetics model is grounded in peer-reviewed cannabis research, with trait heritability, variation coefficients, and correlations derived from studies spanning 2018–2023. For instance, THC content has a heritability of 89%, while yield components are 47% heritable, reflecting real-world genetic behavior.

  * Trait expression is dynamically calculated using Genotype × Environment (GxE) interactions, where environmental conditions modify genetic potential. This mirrors actual cannabis cultivation, where factors like temperature and humidity shape outcomes.

  * The system focuses on natural breeding techniques like tissue culture and micropropagation, preserving biological authenticity and aligning with the game’s simulation goals.

* **Blockchain Security**:

  * A blockchain-based verification system ensures the uniqueness and authenticity of each strain, creating an immutable genetic ledger. Every breeding event generates a cryptographic hash from parental genetics and a mutation seed, recorded as a “Gene-Event Packet” in the chain.

  * Players unknowingly maintain this distributed network through breeding actions, which serve as proof-of-work via complex genetic calculations. Witness nodes (other players) verify these events, achieving consensus without requiring direct player interaction with blockchain mechanics.

  * This “invisible blockchain” guarantees that strains cannot be forged, with each genetic pattern tied to its lineage via cryptographic proofs, enhancing both security and player trust in trading.

#### **View Mode:**

* **Genetics Mode**: Displays detailed genetic data visually (e.g., trait overlays on plants), with a menu for selecting and planting genetics.

### **Simulation Details**

The simulation ties the pillars together, modeling:

* **Environmental Factors**: Temperature, humidity, light, and CO2 interact dynamically.

* **Plant Biology**: Growth, nutrient uptake, and stress responses reflect real-world data.

* **Resource Consumption**: Electricity, water, and nutrients deplete based on usage.

* **Pests and Diseases**: Randomized challenges require proactive management.

The simulation runs continuously, with no distinct phases, encouraging players to plan for overlapping activities.

#### **Genotype × Environment (GxE) Interactions**

The simulation models complex GxE interactions, adding depth and realism to cultivation and breeding. A plant’s genetic potential interacts with its environment to determine final trait expression, based on cannabis research and mathematical precision.

* **Environmental Factors**:

  * Key variables include temperature, humidity, light intensity, CO2 levels, and nutrient availability. Each factor influences traits differently—e.g., light intensity strongly affects yield, while temperature impacts flowering time.

  * The system uses research-calibrated response curves, ensuring environmental effects are realistic. For example, optimal temperature (25°C) boosts THC expression, while extremes (15°C or 35°C) reduce it.

* **Trait-Specific Responses**:

  * Traits vary in environmental sensitivity. CBD content (96% heritable) is stable across conditions, while stress tolerance (40% heritable) is highly plastic, shifting with environmental stress levels.

  * Correlations between traits (e.g., THC and CBD at \-0.85) add complexity, requiring players to balance trade-offs when optimizing conditions.

* **Dynamic Simulation**:

  * Trait expressions update in real-time as environmental conditions change, calculated via a GxE engine that combines genetic potential with environmental modifiers. This allows players to experiment and observe immediate results.

  * The simulation’s realism is enhanced by fractal-based variation and harmonic interference, ensuring diverse outcomes even within identical genetics under different conditions.
