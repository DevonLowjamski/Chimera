## Gameplay Flow

### Complete Marketplace Flow Example

#### Phase 1: Seller Lists Genetics
```csharp
// Player breeds exceptional strain
PlantGenotype genotype = breedingService.BreedPlants(parent1, parent2);
// → "Golden Goat F6" - 30% THC, verified blockchain hash

// Create marketplace listing
GeneticsListingData geneticsData = new GeneticsListingData
{
    GeneticHash = genotype.GeneticFingerprint,  // Blockchain verified
    StrainName = "Golden Goat F6",
    Generation = 6,  // F6 = stabilized
    THCPercentage = 30f,
    CBDPercentage = 1.2f,
    YieldPotential = 400f,  // 400g/plant
    FloweringDays = 63,
    IsBlockchainVerified = true
};

MarketplaceListing listing = geneticsMarketplace.CreateListing(
    sellerId: "Player1",
    sellerName: "GrowMaster",
    sellerReputation: 4.8f,
    genotype: genotype,
    description: "Stabilized F6, incredible potency",
    priceSkillPoints: 150,
    durationDays: 30
);
// → Listing created: "Golden Goat F6 at 150 SP (Verified: ✅)"
```

#### Phase 2: Buyer Searches
```csharp
// Buyer searches for high THC genetics
MarketplaceFilters filters = new MarketplaceFilters
{
    SearchQuery = "high THC",
    MinPrice = null,
    MaxPrice = 200,
    MinSellerRating = 4.5f,
    VerifiedGeneticsOnly = true,
    SortOrder = MarketplaceSortOrder.PriceHighToLow
};

List<MarketplaceListing> results = geneticsMarketplace.SearchListings(filters);
// → Finds "Golden Goat F6" in results
```

#### Phase 3: Purchase Transaction
```csharp
// Buyer clicks "Buy"
bool success = transactionManager.PurchaseListing(
    listingId: "GEN_abc12345",
    buyerId: "Player2",
    onItemReceived: (genotype) => {
        // Add to buyer's seed bank
        seedBankManager.AddGenetics(genotype);
    }
);

// Behind scenes:
// 1. Validate buyer has 150 SP ✓
// 2. Deduct 150 SP from buyer (SkillTreeManager.SpendSkillPoints)
// 3. Transfer genetics to buyer
// 4. Calculate commission: 150 * 0.05 = 8 SP
// 5. Credit seller: 150 - 8 = 142 SP (SkillTreeManager.AwardSkillPoints)
// 6. Record transaction
// 7. Update seller stats

// Result:
// - Buyer: -150 SP, +Golden Goat F6 genetics
// - Seller: +142 SP
// - Marketplace: +8 SP commission
```

#### Phase 4: Reputation Update
```csharp
// Buyer rates transaction
transactionManager.RateTransaction(
    transactionId: "TXN_xyz789",
    rating: 5.0f,
    review: "Amazing genetics, exactly as described!"
);

// Updates seller reputation:
// Previous: 4.8 stars (20 ratings)
// New: 4.82 stars (21 ratings)
```

## Skill Point Integration

### Dual-Use Currency (from Gameplay Doc)

**"Skill Points are earned through gameplay, used for progression and trading"**

#### Earning Skill Points
```csharp
// Player completes objective
skillTreeManager.AwardSkillPoints(5, "First harvest");

// Player achieves milestone
skillTreeManager.AwardSkillPoints(10, "100 plants harvested");

// Player breeds exceptional genetics
skillTreeManager.AwardSkillPoints(8, "Discovered 30% THC phenotype");

// Player sells on marketplace
transactionManager.OnSkillPointsEarned += (userId, amount) => {
    // Seller earned SP from sale (auto-awarded)
};
```

#### Spending Skill Points
```csharp
// Option 1: Unlock progression
skillTreeManager.UnlockNode("tissue_culture_node");  // -3 SP
skillTreeManager.UnlockNode("advanced_breeding_node");  // -5 SP

// Option 2: Buy from marketplace
transactionManager.PurchaseListing(listingId, buyerId);  // -150 SP

// Option 3: Mixed strategy
skillTreeManager.UnlockNode("genetics_node");  // -5 SP (unlock breeding)
// → Breed amazing strain
// → Sell on marketplace for +142 SP
// → Net gain: +137 SP for next unlocks/purchases
```

---

## Trust & Verification System

### Blockchain Genetics Verification

**Problem**: Players could list fake/low-quality genetics
**Solution**: Blockchain hash validation

```csharp
// When creating genetics listing
string geneticHash = genotype.GeneticFingerprint;  // SHA-256 hash

bool isVerified = blockchainService.HasGeneticRecord(geneticHash);
// → Checks if hash exists in blockchain ledger

if (isVerified)
{
    // Listing shows ✅ Verified badge
    // Buyers trust this is authentic genetics
    // Seller builds reputation
}
else
{
    // Listing rejected if verification required
    // Or shown as ⚠️ Unverified (buyer beware)
}
```

### Seller Reputation

**Reputation Factors**:
1. **Average Rating**: Buyer ratings (1-5 stars)
2. **Total Sales**: Number of successful transactions
3. **Verified Genetics %**: Percentage of genetics that were blockchain verified
4. **Dispute Count**: Number of reported issues

**Reputation Impact**:
- High reputation (4.5+ stars) → Featured listings
- Low reputation (<3 stars) → Buyers filter out
- Verified genetics → Builds trust faster
- Disputes → Reputation penalty

```csharp
SellerProfile profile = transactionManager.GetSellerProfile("GrowMaster");

// Results:
// - AverageRating: 4.82/5
// - TotalSales: 47
// - GeneticsSold: 35
// - SchematicsSold: 12
// - VerifiedGeneticsPercentage: 94%  // 33/35 genetics verified
// - TotalSkillPointsEarned: 4,280 SP
// - DisputeCount: 1

// → High-trust seller, featured in search results
```

## Market Analytics

### Real-Time Market Data

```csharp
MarketplaceAnalytics analytics = transactionManager.GetMarketplaceAnalytics();

// Results:
// - ActiveListings: 237
//   - Genetics: 142
//   - Schematics: 95
//
// - TotalTransactions: 1,583
// - TotalSkillPointsTraded: 94,670 SP

// - MostTradedSchematic: "Auto-Water 4x4 Room"
//
// - TransactionsLast24Hours: 43
// - NewListingsLast24Hours: 18
```

### Price Discovery

**Market-Driven Pricing**:
- Players set their own prices
- Supply/demand determines value
- Rare genetics command higher prices
- Popular schematics sell more volume

**Price Ranges**:
- **Genetics**: 10-1000 SP
  - Common strains: 20-50 SP
  - High THC/CBD: 80-150 SP
  - Rare phenotypes: 200-500 SP
  - Legendary genetics: 500-1000 SP

- **Schematics**: 5-500 SP
  - Basic layouts: 5-20 SP
  - Advanced setups: 30-80 SP
  - Automation configs: 100-200 SP
  - Complete facilities: 300-500 SP

## Integration Points

### Skill Tree Integration
```csharp
// SkillTreeManager provides SP balance
int availableSP = skillTreeManager.AvailableSkillPoints;

// Marketplace spends SP
bool success = skillTreeManager.SpendSkillPoints(150, "Marketplace purchase");

// Marketplace awards SP
skillTreeManager.AwardSkillPoints(142, "Marketplace sale");
```

### Blockchain Integration
```csharp
// BlockchainGeneticsService verifies genetics
bool isVerified = blockchainService.HasGeneticRecord(geneticHash);

// Prevents fraud in genetics trading
if (isVerified)
{
    // Listing marked as verified
    // Buyer trusts authenticity
}
```

### Processing Pipeline Integration
```csharp
// High-quality processing → Higher marketplace value
ProcessingQualityReport report = processingCalculator.AnalyzeQuality(batch);
// → Quality 95% (Premium+) → 2.0x market value multiplier

// Could sell processed product on marketplace (future)
// Base price $30/g × 2.0 quality multiplier = $60/g
```
