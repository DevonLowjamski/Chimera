## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

1. **Prioritizing integration tests** - Highest ROI infrastructure investment
2. **Quality over quantity** - Comprehensive tests > rushing refactoring
3. **Pragmatic standards** - Accepting well-structured 550-line files vs. over-optimizing
4. **Incremental commits** - Steady, reviewable progress with clear messages
5. **Data extraction pattern** - Quick wins for simple structural improvements

### Strategic Adjustments Applied

1. **Test-driven validation** - Tests now validate all architecture changes
2. **Pragmatic file sizing** - Focus on poorly-structured files, not arbitrary limits
3. **Coordinator pattern recognition** - Accept well-designed 550-600 line coordinators
4. **Phase 1 deferral** - Complex refactoring better done during feature work
5. **Quality gate refinement** - Eliminated false positives, improved accuracy

### Process Improvements for Phase 1

1. **Incremental refactoring** - Continue file improvements during feature development
