Abstract: The use of cannabis for medicinal purposes dates back well before the era of modern medicine, but in  recent years research into the use of medical cannabis in the medical and pharmaceutical sciences has grown sig nificantly. In European countries, most cannabis plants have been and still are grown for industrial purposes. For  this reason, hemp cultivation technology is relatively well researched, while little is known about the key factors  affecting cannabis cultivation for medical purposes. The active substances of cannabis plant targeted by this review  are called phytocannabinoids. The biosynthesis of phytocannabinoids is relatively well understood, but the specific  environmental factors that influence the type and number of phytocannabinoids have been much less studied. Indoor  or greenhouse cultivation, which uses automated lighting, ventilation, irrigation systems and complex plant nutrition  has become much more sophisticated and appears to be the most effective method for producing medical cannabis.  There are many different cultivation systems for cannabis plants, but one of the essential elements of the process is  an optimal plant nutrition and selection of fertilisers to achieve it. This review summarises the existing knowledge  about phytocannabinoid biosynthesis and the conditions suitable for growing plants as sources of medical cannabis.  This review also attempts to delineate how nutrient type and bioavailability influences the synthesis and accumula 
tion of specific phytocannabinoids based on contemporary knowledge of the topic.

Cannabis is one of the earliest of domesticated  crops. According to Chinese historical records and  archaeological findings, its cultivation and utilisa tion can be traced back to 3 000 to 4 000 years BCE  (Yu 1987, Jiang et al. 2006). The first use of can nabis for therapeutic purposes, directly evidenced  by the finding of the stable cannabis compound, Δ6-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ6-THC), has been dated  to around 400 CE in a carbonised material discovered  in a tomb at Beit Shemesh near Jerusalem (Zlas et al.  1993). Recent years have seen a boom in research on  medical cannabis in the biomedical and pharmaceu tical sectors. The applicability and acceptability of  medical cannabis is expanding, as seen by the growing  number of countries that allow its use for specific  therapeutic indications (Shelef et al. 2011, Troutt and  
Didonato 2015, Balneaves and Alraja 2019). The num ber of active phytocannabinoids under investigation  continues to increase and their effects on a variety of  diseases such as chronic pain (Lynch and Campbell  2011, Portenoy et al. 2012, Wilsey et al. 2013), nausea  and vomiting (Lane et al. 1991, Duran et al. 2010),  spasticity (Pooyania et al. 2010, Corey-Bloom et al.  2012), depression (Wade et al. 2004, Selvarajah et  al. 2010, Portenoy et al. 2012), glaucoma (Järvinen  et al. 2002), inflammatory bowel disease (Ravikoff  Allegretti et al. 2013), psychosis, motor and non 
motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (Lotan et al.  2014), anxiety and sleep disorder (Russo et al. 2007,  Bonn-Miller et al. 2014, Babson et al. 2017) are be ing studied (Doyle and Spence 1995, Järvinen et al.  2002, Lynch and Campbell 2011, Grotenhermen and

Muller-Vahl 2012, Ravikoff Allegretti et al. 2013, Lotan  et al. 2014). Nearly 150 different phytocannabinoid  compounds are currently known (Hanuš et al. 2016). 
TAXONOMY 
History 
The genetic plasticity of cannabis makes it difficult  to catalog, and there is still a debate about its proper  botanical classification. Linnaeus (1753) described  Cannabis sativa as a single species. Based on com 
parative analyses of the psychoactive effects, leaf size,  shape and structure of Indian and European varieties,  Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1786) classified the Indian  cultivars as a separate species, Cannabis indica.  At the beginning of the 20th century, the Russian  botanist Janischevsky (1924) found that the local  Russian plants possessed different characteristics  from both C. sativa and C. indica yet still belonged  to the cannabis taxon. These small, wild-growing,  auto-flowering plants have been classified as a sepa rate species named Cannabis ruderalis (Figure 1). 
Current nomenclature 
Small and Cronquist (1976) utilised a biphasic  approach combining morphological and chemical  characteristics to divide the Cannabis genus into  the following four groups: 
Cannabis sativa   
C. indica 
C. ruderalis 
1. Cannabis sativa L. subsp. sativa var. sativa, 2. Cannabis sativa L. subsp. sativa var. spontanea Vavilov, 
3. Cannabis sativa L. subsp. indica Small & Cronquist  var. indica (Lam) Wehmer, 
4. Cannabis sativa L. subsp. indica Small & Cronquist  var. kafiristanica (Vavilov) Small & Cronquist  (Figure 2). 
Hillig (2005) concluded from his genomic study of  the classification of C. sativa that none of the previous  taxonomic concepts sufficiently defined the sativa and indica genes. He analysed different genotypes  from various geographical origins and was therefore  inclined to a multi-species classification including C. sativa, C. indica and C. ruderalis. Small (2015) has  recently proposed two possible cannabis taxonomic  classifications. The first is consistent with an earlier  division (Small and Cronquist 1976) and is in accord ance with the International Code of Nomenclature  for Algae, Fungi, and Plants (McNeill et al. 2012).  The second, for domesticated cannabis, follows the  guidelines of the International Code of Nomenclature  for Cultivated Plants (Brickell et al. 2009): 
Non-narcotic plants, domesticated for stem fib er and/or oilseeds in West Asia and Europe. Low Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content and high  cannabidiol (CBD) content (Hillig and Mahlberg  (2004) Cannabis sativa "hemp biotype"). 
Non-narcotic plants, domesticated for stem fiber  and/or oilseeds in East Asia, mainly China. From  low to moderate THC content and high CBD con tent (Hillig and Mahlberg (2004) Cannabis indica "hemp biotype"). 
Psychoactive plants, domesticated in Southern and  Central Asia. High THC content and low or absent  CBD content (Hillig and Mahlberg (2004) Cannabis  indica "narrow-leaflet drug (NLD) biotype"). 
Psychoactive plants, domesticated in Southern  Asia (Afghanistan and neighboring countries). From  moderate to high THC and CBD content (Hillig and  Mahlberg (2004) Cannabis indica "wide-leaflet drug  (WLD) biotype"). 
In addition, two hybrid classes have also been  generated:  
5. Non-narcotic plants, hybrid cultivars between two  fiber (hemp) groups (1 and 2). 
6. Psychoactive plants, hybrid cultivars between two  narcotic groups (3 and 4).  
Hillig and Mahlberg (2004) analysed the content of  cannabinoids in various cannabis plants and based

Cannabis sativa "hemp biotype" – 62 plants were  analysed, ranges of the dry-weight percentages of  THC were measured 0.1–11.5% and CBD were meas ured 0.0–13.6%. 
Cannabis indica "hemp biotype" – 45 plants were  analysed, ranges of the dry-weight percentages of  THC were measured 0.1–9.3% and CBD were meas ured 0.0–8.5%. 
Cannabis indica "narrow-leaflet drug (NLD) bio type" – 68 plants were analysed, ranges of the dry weight percentages of THC were measured 1.4–12.4%  and CBD were measured 0.0–0.1%. 
Cannabis indica "wide-leaflet drug (WLD) biotype" – 40 plants were analysed, ranges of the dry-weight  percentages of THC were measured 0.1–14.7% and  CBD were measured 0.0–11.0%. 
All cannabis species successfully cross and pro duce fertile hybrids (Beutler and Marderosian 1978).  Indica and sativa plants have also been found to dif fer in terpene and cannabinoid profiles. Thus, these  chemotaxonomic markers are a promising tool for  screening hybrids (Hillig 2004, Hillig and Mahlberg  2004, Fischedick et al. 2010, Elzinga et al. 2015).  Zhang et al. (2018) are recommending that Cannabis  should be recognised as a monotypic species typified  by Cannabis sativa L., containing three subspecies:  subsp. sativa, subsp. indica, and subsp. ruderalis.  
This proposal is based on their study focused on  DNA sequence variations of cannabis plants. Also,  McPartland (2018) in his work mentions that DNA  barcode analysis supports the separation cannabis at  a subspecies level and recognising the nomenclature  of C. sativa subsp. sativa and C. sativa subsp. indica. 
BIOSYNTHESIS OF CANNABINOIDS History 
Actual cannabinoid research is based on a number  of major discoveries made by Professor Raphael  Mechoulam and Professor Yechiel Gaoni. In the  1960’s they identified the psychoactive compo 
nent in Cannabis sativa, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol,  determined and described its chemical structure  (Gaoni and Mechoulam 1964, Mechoulam and Gaoni  1967) and synthesised it (Mechoulam et al. 1967).  Endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligands, called  endocannabinoids, were identified in mammalian  tissues in the 1990s. The best-known examples are  anandamide (Devane et al. 1992) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (Mechoulam et al. 1995). Endocannabinoids  are derived from arachidonic acid, and membrane  lipids serve as a potential source of this fatty acid  (Giuffrida et al. 2001). For this reason, cannabinoids  from cannabis are often referred to as phytocannabi 
noids to differentiate them from endocannabinoids.  427 
Review Plant, Soil and Environment, 67, 2021 (8): 425–442 https://doi.org/10.17221/96/2021-PSE
Biosynthesis of phytocannabinoids 
Phytocannabinoids can be divided into two  groups, neutral cannabinoids and cannabinoid acids.  Diversification is based on how many carboxyl groups the  molecule has, but non-enzymatic decarboxylation can  occur during storage and especially at elevated temper 
atures when cannabis is smoked (Kimura and Okamoto  1970, Shoyama et al. 1970). Phytocannabinoids, pre nylated polyketides of mixed biosynthetic origin,  are synthesised from fatty acid precursors and iso prenoids. All phytocannabinoid structures contain a monoterpenic unit attached to the phenolic ring hav ing the C3 alkylated carbon (Dewick 2002). The alkyl  side chain can vary in length from one to five carbons  (Figure 3) and n-pentyl is the most abundant (Elsohly  and Slade 2005). Phytocannabinoids containing an  n-propyl side chain are referred to as cannabivarins.  Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), the THC analogue  with an n-propyl side chain, often occurs in C. indica (Hillig and Mahlberg 2004).  
The starting materials for aromatic ring synthesis,  including the alkyl on the third carbon (Hanuš et al.  2016), are three molecules of malonyl-CoA and one  molecule of hexanoyl-CoA derived from hexanoic  (caproic) acid (Dewick 2002). The hexanoyl-CoA  acts as a primer for the type III polyketide synthase  enzyme, also known as tetraketide synthase (TKS),  which also requires the olivetolic acid cyclase en zyme (OAC) catalysing a C2–C7 intramolecular  aldol condensation with carboxyl group retention  to produce olivetolic acid (Taura et al. 2009, Gagne  et al. 2012). These transformations can give rise to  by-products such as 4-hydroxy-6-pentylpyran-2-one  (PDAL), 4-hydroxy-6-(2-oxoheptyl)pyran-2-one  (HTAL) and olivetol. Cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) is  further derived from olivetolic acid after alkylation  with a monoterpene unit, geranylpyrophosphate, with  the participation of geranylpyrophosphate:olivetolate  geranyltransferase (GOT) (Figure 4) (Fellermeier and  Zenk 1998). Also, the (Z)-isomer of cannabigerolic  acid, cannabinerolic acid (CBNRA), is synthesised to  a small extent when neryl pyrophosphate is used by  
  

the GOT enzyme instead of geranyl pyrophosphate  (Taura et al. 1995a). There are three acids that can  be formed from CBGA and CBNRA.  
Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) is produced  during the formation of the heterocyclic ring by the  THCA synthase enzyme, which can convert CBGA  or CBNRA to THCA (Figure 5) (Taura et al. 1995b).  However, the low THCA synthase specificity for  CBNRA compared to CBGA suggested that THCA  was predominantly synthesised from CBGA. The  course of this reaction is similar to that of other  reactions catalysed by monoterpenic cyclases. Most  of the cyclases require divalent ions such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ for their activity, but this is not the case  with THCA synthase (Taura 2009). The presence of a carboxyl group in the substrate molecule is essential  for the reaction because THCA synthase does not  recognize neutral phytocannabinoids such as can nabigerol (CBG) as substrates (Taura et al. 2007a). 
The structure of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) is  the result of a pericyclic reaction involving loss of a proton (Figure 6) (Dewick 2002). The modification  is catalysed by the intramolecular oxidoreductase,  CBDA synthase, which selectively favours the forma 
tion of CBDA from CBGA over its (Z)-isomer, CBNRA  (Taura et al. 1996). The effects of various metal ions  (Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Co2+ and Cu2+) on its activity  were investigated, but they did not alter the rate of  catalysis. In contrast, the Hg2+ ion completely inhib 
ited enzyme activity at a concentration of 2 mmol,  and the chelating agent, ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid (EDTA), at concentrations up to 5 mmol showed a low positive effect on enzyme activity. Thus, CBDA  synthase does not appear to require metal ions for  CBGA oxidocyclization (Taura et al. 1996). CBDA  synthase and THCA synthase catalyse the formation  of single optical isomers at a purity of greater than  95% (Taura et al. 2007b). 
Cannabichromenic acid (CBCA) is derived from  CBGA by oxidation and cyclisation by cannabichromen ic acid synthase (CBCA synthase) (Figure 7). CBCA is  synthesised as a 5:1 enantiomeric mixture, probably  because of the partial release of intermediates from  the CBCA synthase active site prior to completion of  the reaction (Morimoto et al. 1997). Tests of the metal  ions, Mg2+, Zn2+, Ca2+ and Cu2+, showed that none  of them stimulated enzyme activity. Hg2+, however,  completely inhibited the reaction at a concentration  of 1 mmol. EDTA slightly increased enzyme activity  suggesting that the CBCA synthase reaction does not

Croteau (1987) discovered that all terpene cyclases  require bivalent cations for their function because  these metal ions are able to neutralise the negative  charge on the diphosphate groups on the terpene  molecules and ionise the allyl diphosphate substrate.  Since CBGA does not contain a diphosphate group it  is to be expected that CBCA synthase, CBDA synthase  and THCA synthase have no requirement for bivalent  cations. The most of the cannabinoids present in C. sativa can be categorised as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol  (Δ9-THC), CBD, CBC, CBG, cannabinol (CBN), can 
nabicyclol (CBL), cannabielsoin (CBE) and cannabi triol (CBT) (Turner et al. 1980, Razdan 1986, Ross  and Elsohly 1995). Δ9-THCA, CBDA and CBCA are  also sometimes called primary phytocannabinoids  because other phytocannabinoids are generated from  these three precursors predominantly by nonenzy matic degradative pathways. 
Primary phytocannabinoids can either be decarboxy lated to their neutral form (Figure 8) or converted to  CBE, CBN, CBT, Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC) or  CBL via exposure to light, heat and oxygen (Figure 9). CBD can undergo photooxidation or pyrolysis to form  CBE. Δ9-THC is converted to the thermodynamically  more stable Δ8-THC when exposed to heat, or it may  be degraded to CBT or CBN in the presence of oxygen  (Elsohly and Slade 2005). The presence of CBT and CBN  together with high levels of decarboxylated phytocan nabinoids, are the chemical indicators of lengthy stor age under poor conditions (Shoyama et al. 1970). The  degradation rate of primary phytocannabinoids to these  
cannabidiolic acid 
secondary phytocannabinoids increases with higher  temperature, higher initial concentrations of primary  phytocannabinoids, and with an increase in the inflores cence surface, and thus greater surface exposure to air  (Milay et al. 2020). CBC in the presence of light converts  to CBL-type phytocannabinoids (Elsohly and Slade  2005). Cannabivarins are generated by the same biosyn thetic pathways from cannabigerovarinic acid (CBGVA), a homologous CBGA precursor (Shoyama et al. 1984).  The cannabinoid profile in Cannabis undergoes rapid  changes in the early stages of growth (Potter 2014). CBDA  and THCA synthases have very similar catalytic rates  (kcat = 0.19/s and 0.20/s) and affinity (KM = 134 µmol and 137 µmol) for cannabigerolic acid (Taura et al.  1995b, 1996). The CBCA synthase, however, shows  a lower Michaelis constant (KM = 23 µmol) as well  as a higher catalytic rate (kcat = 0.04/s). In the early  stages of cultivation, where CBGA is still present at  low concentrations, CBCA synthesis predominates  (Morimoto et al. 1998). However, as the CBGA con centration increases over time, the efficacy of THCA  and CBDA biosynthesis increases, and these molecules  soon outweigh the CBCA concentration. At later stages  of growth, CBGA synthesis slows and its relative pro portion in the phytocannabinoid profile is gradually  reduced (Potter 2014).

For this  reason, the procedures for hemp cultivation are well  known, while the growth factors affecting cannabis  cultivation for medical purposes are poorly understood  (Zuk-Golaszewska and Golaszewski 2018). 
Indoor or outdoor medical cannabis cultivation? 
The conditions under which cannabis plants are  grown for drug production is subject to more stringent  protocols relating to the content and type of the active  phytocannabinoids. Among the factors influencing the  composition and yield of phytocannabinoids are the  genotype of the plant, the growing conditions, maturity  at harvest time, storage and handling (Potter 2014).  
It is much more efficient to grow medical canna bis plants in a greenhouse where light, temperature  and humidity can be controlled. Until recently, this  method of cultivation was used mainly by illegal  cannabis growers (Drugs 2009). Outdoor cultivation  is less expensive, but the variability of the environ ment makes it almost impossible to obtain a high 
potency, homogeneous product. Cannabis that is  grown outdoors is also at greater risk from pests and  plant diseases (Potter 2014). Cannabis entrepreneurs  now use sophisticated indoor cultivation methods  with automated control of lighting and photoperiod,  temperature, ventilation and irrigation, and complex  systems for providing nutrients. However, much of  the information on indoor cannabis production is  still obtained from anecdotal sources (Vanhove et al.  2011). Current data on the influence of photoperiod  and even light spectrum allow indoor growers to  regulate such aspects as leaf and shoot growth and  time of vegetation cycle and thus achieve several  growth cycles per year (Farag and Kayser 2015).  Three to six harvests per year (six harvests per year  is the maximum, and in this case, you have to skip  the vegetative phase) can be attained by applying  modern controlled growing practices (Leggett 2006). 
Hydroponics versus soil 
Indoor cannabis cultivation can be accomplished  in several ways, but primarily either in soil or in  soilless culture using hydroponic media. Hydroponic

cultivation has become increasingly popular among  growers. A soilless media such as mineral wool, co

to the roots (Vanhove et al. 2011). The conventional  type of cultivation is in soil with fertilisers applied  through irrigation or by mixing with the soil sub strates. Potter (2014) found that there was no increase  in phytocannabinoid potency or in biomass under  hydroponic conditions compared to standard soil  cultivation, and the hydroponic system was more  complicated and difficult to operate and maintain. 
Vegetation cycle of cannabis 
Cannabis is a short-day plant, naturally blooming  in autumn, and the induction of flowering is regu lated by specialised photoreceptor proteins called  phytochromes. Therefore, the effect of photoperiod  must be taken into an account in indoor cultivation  (Halliday and Fankhauser 2003). The vegetative phase  lasts from 2–4 weeks after rooting the clones or germi nating the seeds (De Backer et al. 2012). The relative  humidity in this phase should be from 70% to 80%  with a temperature from 21 °C to 28 °C (Chandra et  al. 2008). The generative phase is induced by shorten ing the photoperiod to 12 h light and 12 h dark. The  first flowers should appear about one week after the  reduction of the light period. The development of stems  and leaves gradually slows down and stops after three  weeks of this photoperiod, while the flowers continue to  develop over the next 8 weeks (De Backer et al. 2012).  The monitoring of 200 high THC cannabis varieties  showed that the average flowering time with 12 h light  period was 57 days, and 88% of the plants flowered  between 7 and 9 weeks (Carpentier et al. 2012). The  recommended temperatures are similar to the previous  phase from 21 °C to 28 °C. However, humidity should  be lowered to 40% over the generative phase to reduce  the risk of fungal diseases (Vanhove et al. 2011, 2012).  
Effect of CO2 concentration 
In order to prevent mold, a dry environment and  constant air circulation should be ensured in indoor  cannabis growing rooms, either from outdoor ventila tion with filters or by indoor fans. It is also recom mended to increase the concentration of CO2 during  the light phase of the day (cycle) to improve photosyn thesis, plant growth and thus increase biomass yield  (Kimball 1983, Wheeler et al. 1996, Chandra et al.  2008, 2011). Elevated CO2 concentration can improve  the assimilation of carbon, thereby accelerate plant  growth and potentially improve productivity (Kimball  1983). There is a close correlation between plant yield  
and photosynthesis rate because more than 90% of  plant dry matter is derived from photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (Zelitch 1975). However, the improved  level of plant photosynthesis and growth appear to  
be species- and variety-specific (Minorsky 2002). Wang et al. (2008) investigated the effects of stand ard (370 ppm) and high (700 ppm) CO2 concentra tions on photosynthesis tolerance to acute heat stress  (daily growth temperature was increased by 15 °C  every day for 4 h) in cool-season and warm-season  of C3 plants. High CO2 concentration increased the  cool-season and warm-season C3 plants tolerance  of photosynthesis to acute heat stress. Hamilton et  al. (2008) further elaborated the previous idea and  concluded that the effects of growth temperature  on photosynthetic thermotolerance between C3 and  C4 plants are different and affected by the state of  acclimatisation of the plants. A high concentration  of CO2 (700 ppm) increases the thermotolerance  of C3 plants photosynthesis, except for C3 plants  grown at the supra-optimal (5 °C above optimal)  growth temperature, then increased CO2 may pro vide no advantage or even reduce photosynthesis.  On the other hand, increased CO2 often reduces the  photosynthetic thermotolerance of C4 plants at both  optimal and supra-optimal growth temperatures. Chandra et al. (2011) performed experiments di rectly on cannabis and showed that increasing CO2 concentration from 390 ppm to 700 ppm increased  the rate of photosynthesis in different varieties of  Cannabis sativa by 38–48% and improved efficiency  of water uptake.  
Artificial light 
To achieve optimal biomass and phytocannabinoid  production, artificial lighting must meet certain pa rameters. These include light intensity in lumens per  m2 (lux units) and radiation intensity in watts per m2 and the wavelength. Wavelength is particularly im portant because plants require different wavelengths  of light during the growth. In the vegetative (roots  and shoots) phase, the light should be 420–460 nm  which corresponds to blue light, which promotes  phototropism and growth hormone production in  the plants. In the flowering phase, a red spectrum  (600–680 nm) that is well absorbed by chlorophyll  is best (Mahlberg and Hemphill 1983). For indoor  cannabis cultivation, fluorescent T-5 lighting, metal halide lamps (MH), high-pressure sodium lamps  (HPS) for the growth and light-emitting diodes (LED),  
433 
Review Plant, Soil and Environment, 67, 2021 (8): 425–442 https://doi.org/10.17221/96/2021-PSE
high-pressure sodium lamps (HPS) for the generative  phase are most commonly used (Sweet 2016). These  lamps differ in the composition of the inside gases,  and they produce the light of different wavelengths. 
The optimal intensity of illumination. The ex periments of Potter and Duncombe (2012) showed  positive relationship between the intensity of illu mination and amount of biomass harvested. They  determined three zones with elevated illumination  energy 270, 400 and 600 W/m2. Five plants of each  variety were placed in each of the three zones at a density of 10 plants/m2. In the growth rooms, daily  average temperatures were maintained at 25 ± 2 °C. A constant supply of fresh air kept CO2 concentration  in the environment between 350 ppm and 390 ppm. Irradiance levels at the surface of the plant canopy  were measured using a hand-held light meter deter mined the photosynthetically active radiation 80, 120  and 180 W/m2 according to variants. Within plants  growth, the lamps were kept at a constant distance  from the cannabis canopy. The greatest harvest was  achieved at 600 W/m2 of the illumination intensity.  Furthermore, the THC contents in the leaves and  inflorescences of the mentioned variants were meas ured, but no significant increase in the concentra tion of THC was recorded with an increase of light  intensity. Toonen et al. (2006) also reported that  plants grown under 600 W lamps achieved higher  
yields than plants grown under 400 W lamps. Decreasing tendency of plants to convert light  energy into biomass with increasing levels of ra diation is probably due to the fact, that plants have a limited ability to use light for photosynthesis. Under  low light conditions, plants normally show an initial  linear increase in the rate of photosynthesis and thus  a tendency to convert light energy into biomass in  response to increasing irradiation. However, un der brighter conditions, the growth rate slows as  chloroplasts become more and more saturated with  light (Evans et al. 1993, Ögren and Evans 1993).  This has also been proven on cannabis. The rate  of increase in photosynthetic activity went down  rapidly when irradiation levels rose above 100 W/m2 of photosynthetically active radiation. Since 300 W/m2 of photosynthetically active radiation, almost no in crease in photosynthetic activity has been observed  (Lydon et al. 1987). 
HPS lamps versus LED. Magagnini et al. (2018)  concluded that HPS-lit plants were higher and had  a larger amount of dry matter than LED-lit plants.  Conversely, plants under LED fixtures contained  
434 
higher levels of CBD and THC than under the HPS.  Namdar et al. (2019) also found out significant increase  in concentration of CBGA in the inflorescences that  flowered under LED illumination, with CBGA:THCA  ratio of 1:2 as opposed to 1:16 when grown under  HPS. Because of the high level of illumination, it was  necessary to install a ventilation fan for cooling to the  optimum temperature for photosynthesis of 25 °C to  30 °C (Bazzaz et al. 1975). A more efficient alterna tive is to use banks of LEDs that produce relatively  little heat (Bessho and Shimizu 2012). LEDs do not  consume much energy, do not require ballasts, and  produce only a small amount of heat compared to  high intensity discharge lamps. LEDs are compact,  have long lives, very good wavelength specificity,  relatively cool radiating surfaces, and linear photon  output with electrical input current (Massa et al. 2008).  
NUTRITION 
In the area of plant nutrition for medical cannabis  production, there is currently a lack of experimental  data in the literature (Caplan et al. 2017a). It is known  that the content of cannabinoids in leaves gradually  decreases from top to bottom of the hemp plant  (Hemphill et al. 1980) and from the literature about  hemp cultivation can be deduced that nutrient appli cation can affect the final cannabinoid content of the  plants as well as their total yield. This suggests that  nutrition could play a similar role for medical can 
nabis grown under controlled conditions. However,  cannabis for hemp production has been selectively  bred to produce fiber and is therefore likely to have  slightly different nutrient needs than cannabis grown  for medicinal purposes. The hemp crop is also grown  in the field and not indoors (Hillig and Mahlberg  2004, Van Bakel et al. 2011, Amaducci et al. 2015). 
Acceptable forms of individual essential nutrients  are divided by Barker and Pilbeam (2015) into two  groups according to plant needs, namely macronu trients: nitrogen (NO3–, NH4+), phosphorus (H2PO4–, HPO42–), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), sulfur  (SO42–), magnesium (Mg2+), and micronutrients: iron  (Fe2+, Fe3+), chlorine (Cl–), manganese (Mn2+), zinc  (Zn2+), copper (Cu+, Cu2+), boron (H3BO3, H2BO3–),  molybdenum (MoO42–) and nickel (Ni2+). 
Macronutrients 
Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK). It is as sumed that the nitrogen content in the vegetative parts of  
Plant, Soil and Environment, 67, 2021 (8): 425–442 Review https://doi.org/10.17221/96/2021-PSE
the hemp plant positively correlates with the THC content  (Haney and Kutscheid 1973). Thus, older leaves contain less  THC than younger leaves because they contain less nitro gen. In contrast, high nitrogen levels in applied nitrogen fer tilisers reduce the THC content of the hemp leaves (Bócsa  et al. 1997). For example, good hemp production requires  optimum soil nitrogen levels in the range of 50–200 kg/ha (Vera et al. 2004, Aubin et al. 2015), but these recommenda tions are not applicable for hydroponic or soil cultivation  where studies on indoor cannabis cultivation indicated  nitrogen fertilisation should be provided in the range of  190–400 mg N/L. This value has also been reported for  nitrogen supplementation of organic, greenhouse-grown  
tomatoes (Zhai et al. 2009, Surrage et al. 2010). Hemp growth and an increase in THC content were  positively correlated with soil P content (Coffman  and Gentner 1977). A negative relationship has been  reported for CBD content in leaf tissue relative to  available P. Hemp grown on soils depleted of P showed  an increased CBD content (Coffman and Gentner  1975). Conversely, phosphorus enhancement did not  show any positive effect on THC, CBD, CBN or CBG  concentrations in buds from the top of the medical  cannabis plants (Bernstein et al. 2019b).  Saloner et al. (2019) investigated response of medical  cannabis to different potassium supply in vegetative  growing phase. The results show that the response to  nutrition is highly dependent on the genotype. Plants  in this study were exposed to five different levels of  K supply (15–240 ppm). Generally, both cultivars  showed increased K concentration in all plant parts  with increased K supply. Insufficient K dose for opti mal growth and function was the lowest tested supply 15 ppm of K. Also, the highest dose proved excessive  and damaging effect to development for one of the two  tested genotypes. Similarities proven at both genotypes  were in trends of accumulation and uptake. Results  demonstrated competition between K and Ca with  Mg uptake and no effect on P and N uptake except  in the K deficiency range. Potassium supply showed  only little effect on micronutrient accumulation in  the plant shoot which was similar for both cultivars. In contrast, no significant effect on hemp biomass  and THC was observed in relation to different doses  of N and K (Coffman and Gentner 1977). According  to Hanuš and Dostálová (1994), various combinations  of selected macroelements (N, P, K) in hemp culture  can significantly affect the type of phytocannabinoids  present and their individual contents. One of a few  available sources of scientific literature dealing directly  with this issue is the article by Caplan et al. (2017a,  
b), who reported a concentration of 389 mg N/L as  optimal during the growth phase for maximum yield.  The ratio of the basic macroelements (N, P, and K)  in the vegetative period was 4:1.3:1.7. After making  the calculations for P and K, we obtained values of  126 mg P/L and 165 mg K/L. In the generative phase,  212–261 mg N/L was the optimal amount. A nitrogen  concentration of 283 mg N/L gave the maximum yield  of inflorescence and biomass, but the concentrations  of phytocannabinoids in the dried product was lower.  The ratio of N, P, and K in the generative period was  set at 2:0.87:3.32. Therefore, an initial concentration of 283 mg N/L, would require 123 mg P/L and 470 mg  K/L. The plants tested were propagated from 17 day-old  cuttings, which were fertilised with a solution of the  indicated concentration for the following 21 days of  vegetative growth. Another study has proved sensitivity  of phytocannabinoids metabolism to mineral nutrition.  The results presented by Bernstein et al. (2019b) show  that increased treatment of inorganic NPK increased  levels of CBG in flowers by 71% and decreased levels of  CBN in flowers by 38% compared to a control treatment.  Plants in the control variant were cultivated in potting  mixture with fertigation. Concentration of dissolved  nutrients in the control variant was as follows: 65 ppm  N (1:2 ratio of NH4+/NO3–), 17 ppm P (40 ppm P2O5), 90 ppm K (108 ppm K2O). Micronutrients were sup plied chelated with EDTA at concentration of 0.4 ppm  Fe, 0.2 ppm Mn, and 0.06 ppm Zn.  
The rest of macronutrients. The magnesium cation  content in soils is relatively mobile and its concentra tion in plants, especially in leaves, is high because it is  a component of chlorophyll. The negative correlation  between this metal and copper results from the fact  that the radii of their ions are similar and both ions  can compete for the same binding sites. The content  of Δ9-THC and CBD in hemp leaves decreases with  increasing Mg concentration in the soil. The Δ9-THC  content in leaves is positively correlated with the  ratio of accessible Ca/Mg in soil. CBD is negatively  correlated with available Ca/Zn and Mg/Cu ratios.  Positive correlations of magnesium with Δ8-THC  have been reported with the hypothesis that this  nutrient may be cofactor in the enzyme responsible  for its production (Coffman and Gentner 1975, Pate  1994, Radosavljevic-Stevanovic et al. 2014). 
Micronutrients 
Similar results have been seen for micronutrient  requirements. Positive correlations of iron with 
435

Δ8-THC have been reported with the hypothesis that  this nutrient may be cofactor in the enzyme respon sible for its production (Pate 1994, Radosavljevic Stevanovic et al. 2014). CBD content in hemp plants  is decreasing with increasing iron concentration  (Radosavljevic-Stevanovic et al. 2014). The negative  correlation of iron (Fe) and chromium (Cr) with CBD  can be explained because the catalase responsible for  the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide from the  CBDA synthase reaction is a member of the class that  contains four heme iron groups. Hydrogen peroxide  is strongly sterically hindered upon entry into the  heme cavity where the first step of catalysis takes  place. Transferring a proton from an oxygen atom to  a hydrogen peroxide molecule, and then to a second  oxygen atom extends and polarises the O-O bond,  which eventually decays heterolytically. The first  oxygen atom of the hydrogen peroxide molecule is  coordinated with a heme center, which releases water  and creates an O=Fe(IV)-enzym(+) heme radical. The  radical then quickly breaks down by electron transfer,  removing the radical electron from the porphyrin  ring, which remains unchanged. During the second  step, in a similar two-electron transmission reaction,  the O=Fe(IV)-enzym(+) reacts with a second molecule  of hydrogen peroxide to form the parent molecule  Fe(III) – enzym, water, and molecular oxygen (Boon  et al. 2007, Vlasits et al. 2010). 
Proposed reaction mechanism: 
H2O2 + Fe(III)-enzyme ↔ H2O + O=Fe(IV)-enzyme(+) H2O2 + O=Fe(IV)-enzyme(+) ↔ H2O + Fe(III)-enzyme + O2 Fe-enzyme represents the center of heme iron at tached to the rest of the enzyme. 
The transition state, O=Fe(IV)-enzyme(+) is energeti cally unstable, so these reactions are disadvantageous  (Boon et al. 2007, Vlasits et al. 2010). Although chro mium is not important for plant growth, its negative  correlation with CBD is explained by the fact that Fe  and Cr occur together in nature as a complex oxide  (Radosavljevic-Stevanovic et al. 2014). 
The concentration of CBN and Δ9-THC in hemp  plants can be influenced by the amount of manga nese (Radosavljevic-Stevanovic et al. 2014). A posi tive correlation of manganese with CBN has been  reported (Pate 1994, Radosavljevic-Stevanovic et al.  2014). THCA synthase, which catalyses the oxida tive cyclisation of CBGA to THCA, contains a flavin  adenine dinucleotide (FAD) prosthetic group that  is reduced to FADH2. Molecular oxygen is required  to re-oxidise the FADH2 to FAD, with the forma 
436 
tion of hydrogen peroxide in a 1 : 1 molar ratio to  the resulting THCA as a by-product of the reaction  (Flores-Sanchez and Verpoorte 2008, Shoyama et  al. 2012). CBDA synthase also contains FAD that  is reduced to FADH2 with release of H2O2, but the  reaction differs from THCA synthase in the proton  transfer step (Figure 10) (Taura et al. 2007a). It is  estimated that about 1% of oxygen in plants is used  to form reactive oxygen species in different subcel lular locations with hydrogen peroxide being the  most abundant. Hydrogen peroxide causes oxidative  damage to cells that can lead to apoptosis (Quan et  al. 2008), and plants have evolved efficient ways of  eliminating toxic levels of H2O2. Catalase is a per oxidase enzyme found in all oxygen-using organisms  that rapidly converts H2O2 to water and oxygen.  There are three types of catalase and the non-heme  form utilises manganese (Mn3+) in its catalytic center  that is reduced to Mn2+ during the decomposition  of H2O2 to water and oxygen. Mn2+ can then react  with more peroxide and be converted back to Mn3+ according to the following equations: 
2Mn3+ + H2O2 ↔ 2Mn2+ + O2 + 2H+ 
2Mn2+ + H2O2 + 2H+ ↔ 2H2O + 2Mn3+. 
Both reactions are energetically advantageous  (ΔG < 0). The correlation between manganese and  CBN is also positive since CBN is the primary THC  degradation product (Wu et al. 2004). 
Bernstein et al. (2019a) describes translocation  of individual macro and microelements in relation  to individual plant parts’ age. The work also de scribes, inter alia, the distribution of cannabinoids  in the plant. The research shows that the concen tration of cannabinoids increases with the height  of the plant and the highest concentration can be  found in flowers and inflorescence leaves. The  concentration found in fan leaves is about 1/10 the  concentration found in flowers. The distribution  of mineral nutrients between plant organs shows  a typical uptake and translocation in the plant.  Lower concentrations of N, P, K, and higher Ca  in fan leaves compared to inflorescence supports  physiological findings that the fan leaves are older  than the inflorescence leaves. 
pH value 
Suggested optimal pH range of nutrient solution is  between 5.5–6.5. pH is important because it affects  the availability and absorption of nutrients needed

for plant growth. In hydroponic culture, the recom mended pH range is 5.5–6.0 and the maximum absorp tion of nutrients is usually at pH 5.8 (Velazquez et al.  2013). In growing substrate, a pH range of 5.8–7.2  is recommended and the maximum absorption of  essential nutrients is typically at pH 6.5. When the  pH falls below this range, many macronutrients are  
less available and macronutrient deficiencies can be  developed. When pH values rise above this range,  many micronutrients will not be available for the plant  uptake causing micronutrient deficiencies (Caplan  et al. 2017a). These authors also mention the need  for further research to confirm the optimal range of  pH for multiple cannabis varieties.

Plant biostimulants 
A plant biostimulant is any substance, micro-or ganism strain or mixture of both applied to plants  to increase tolerance to abiotic stress, nutritional  efficiency or crop quality characteristics, regardless  of its nutrient content. Seven main biostimulant  categories were proposed: humic and fulvic acids,  protein hydrolysates, seaweed and botanical extracts,  chitosan and biopolymers, beneficial bacteria, ben 
eficial fungi and beneficial minerals (Du Jardin 2015). Humic and fulvic acids in cannabis nutrition. Humic substances are natural components of soil  organic matter. It is a mixture of heterogeneous  compounds originally classified according to their  molecular weights and solubility into humins, humic  acids and fulvic acids (Du Jardin 2015). Humic acid supplementation had a positive effect on  cannabis in the case of the height of cannabis plants,  the chlorophyll content and the efficiency of photo synthesis, especially immediately after the period  of water stress (Da Cunha Leme Filho et al. 2020). According to the current literature, the effect on  phytocannabinoids is rather negative. Bernstein et  al. (2019b) mentioned that nutritional supplements  such as humic acids significantly reduced spatial vari ability of cannabinoids throughout the plant parts.  This increased uniformity came at the expenses of  THC and CBD content which was reduced by 37%  and 39% respectively in the top parts of plants. The  decrease of THC has been associated with an addi tional trend of CBN increasing. This was probably  due to the accelerated degradation of cannabinoids  in the plant parts with their high concentration. Other biostimulants in cannabis nutrition. Conant  et al. (2017) demonstrated that microbial biostimulant  Mammoth P™ promoted cannabis growth during the  blooming phase. Lyu et al. (2019) hypothesised that  future research will show that plant growth-promoting  bacteria can affect the accumulation of phytocan nabinoids, increase inflorescence yields, protect  against plant pathogens by producing antimicrobial  compounds and reduce the impact of abiotic stresses. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVE 
Based on the above information, it can be stated  that quality of medical cannabis biomass, spectrum  and concentration of phytocannabinoids can be in fluenced by cultivation conditions as well as nutrition  during cultivation. 
438 
For the cultivation of medical cannabis, due to  safety reasons, unpredictable environmental influ ences and required homogenity of harvest, indoor  cultivation is definitely a better option because op timal growing conditions can be set and cannabis  can be harvested from three to six times per year.  Of the growing conditions, artificial light, the level  of CO2 concentration and the humidity of the sur rounding environment influence the harvest quantity  and quality the most. It is very important to choose  the right combination of all mentioned conditions  because they affect each other. 
There is currently only a few experimental data  on the medical cannabis nutrition, so most of this  information is based on the hemp cultivation, which  was bred for fiber production rather than inflores 
cence. However, it can be concluded from the cur rent literature the concentration and spectrum of  individual macronutrients, micronutrients and plant  biostimulants in plant nutrition has a fundamental  impact on biomass formation, spectrum and amount  of medical cannabis cannabinoids. 
In the future, the effects of nutrient ratios and  availability can reasonably be expected to be one of  the main factors influencing the content and type of  cannabinoids in medical cannabis plants, separate  from genotype and microclimate. These issues should  be explored through further experiments, which will  certainly be beneficial because of growing interest  in the phytocannabinoids development in public and  commercial spheres. Future technical research in this  area should focus on possible new indoor medical  cannabis cultivation techniques or the automation of  existing cultivation technologies to facilitate work.
