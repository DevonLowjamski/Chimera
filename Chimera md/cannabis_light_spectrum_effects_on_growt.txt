1. Introduction  
ABSTRACT  
Light is a key factor affecting plant growth, metabolism and function. Metabolic processes in plants are sensitive  to the ratio of Blue:Red light, and there is an increasing awareness that the response to the ratio of these  monochromatic lights may vary under exposure to a wider range of the spectrum, such as white light. Due to the  potential for regulation of the therapeutic chemical profile and plant development, this issue is of growing in 
terest for the cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.) industry that uses photosynthetic light extensively. Cannabis is a  medicinal plant treasured for its secondary metabolites, especially cannabinoids, the unique biologically active  compounds in the plant that are considered to be affected by light spectra. In this study we evaluated the hy pothesis that the ratio of Blue:Red light affects cannabinoid metabolism, and that plant growth and secondary  metabolism is intensified under a full spectrum with similar Blue:Red ratio. Our results point to several spectra  specific reactions and some cultivar dependent responses to light spectrum. i. Yield quantity: The highest  inflorescence yields were obtained when the spectrum was restricted to the red and blue range at the ratio of 1:1,  and in two of the three varieties tested a ratio of 1:4 Blue:Red light had similar results. White light with Blue:Red  ratio of 1:1 had the lowest yield. ii. The chemical profile was also affected by the light spectrum, and CBGA, the  primary cannabinoid and a precursor for most other cannabinoids, demonstrated the highest response. CBGA  accumulation was stimulated by blue-rich light as compared with far-red rich HPS light. The major cannabinoids  CBDA, THCA and CBCA were also affected by light quality, and the response was cultivar specific and less  pronounced than for CBGA. iii. Plant morphology: Blue light was most inductive for maintaining compact plants,  more so than Red:Far-Red ratio. Our results repute the hypothesis that full spectrum improves inflorescence yield  compared with Blue:Red light, but support the hypothesis that light spectrum influences plant development and  the cannabinoid profile, which could be used to fine-tune cannabis and cannabinoid production.  
the red (600− 700 nm) and blue (420− 450 nm) zones of the spectrum,  
which are the maximum absorption ranges for chlorophylls a and b, with  
Light is one of the main signals perceived by plants that affects plant  growth, development and function (Kami et al., 2010). Major light  features that impact plants are light intensity, light quality (the spectral  properties of light) and the photoperiod (the duration of exposure to  light) (Bian et al., 2015; Ouzounis et al., 2015). These factors affect  plants’ function by involvement in the regulation of three main plant  processes: photosynthesis, photoperiodism, and photomorphogenesis.  
Photosynthetic carbon fixation requires light energy and is respon sive mostly to light intensity at specific wavelengths (Evans and Poorter,  2001). The photosynthetic active radiation ranges from 400− 700 nm.  The most influential wavelengths are conventionally considered to be in

carotenoids adding absorption in the 470− 700 nm range. However,  recent studies suggested beneficial effects of full spectrum (white light)  to plant growth and function, compared to monochromatic red and blue  lights (Landi et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2017). Photosynthesis is directly  affected by light intensity, with higher photon flux density at the se 
lective wavelengths supporting higher rates of carbon fixation (Feng  et al., 2019). ’Drug type’ medical cannabis produces unusually large  amounts of secondary metabolites, up to 20 % of the dry weight basis is  not unusual, which entails immense energy demands. The response of  photosynthesis to light spectrum and intensity is therefore important for  understanding regulation of energy balance and secondary metabolism

in the plant.  
Photoperiodism, is the developmental responses of plants to the daily  lengths of light and dark periods, and is based on the plants ability to  sense elapsed time since sunrise or sundown and to regulate processes  according to time of day and day length (Jackson, 2009). Photoperiodic  responses include also flowering initiation (Song et al., 2015), which is  of high importance for the development progression in a short-day plant  such as Cannabis sativa.  
Photomorphogenesis, is the effect of light quality, or spectrum, on  plant development and physiology. It affects major plant developmental  stages including the switch from the vegetative to the flowering stage,  and involves in elongation (Reed et al., 1993), stomatal conductance  (Kim et al., 2004), leaf expansion (Kong and Zheng, 2020), as well as  secondary metabolism (Ouzounis et al., 2015). It is also affected by  photoperiodism (Nagy and Schafer, ¨ 2002). Unlike photosynthesis which  utilizes light as a source of energy, both photomorphogenesis and  photoperiodism are triggered by activation of pigments such as photo tropins, cryptochromes and phytochromes by specific wavelengths even  at low levels of irradiance (Boccalandro et al., 2012; Huch´e-Th´elier  et al., 2016; Nagy and Schafer, ¨ 2002). Light quality is therefore expected  to critically affect physiology, developmental progression,  morpho-development and secondary metabolism in Cannabis sativa, our  model plant of study.  
Cannabis, which is recognized by humanity for thousands of years  for its medical, recreational and industrial potential, is having a boost of  global recognition and cultivation due to recent changes in regulations,  that also facilitate plant-science research and development. The medical  properties of cannabis stem from the plethora of secondary metabolites  such as cannabinoids, flavonoids and terpenes, over a thousand of which  were identified and described in the plant inflorescence (Andre et al.,  2016). Variations in quantities and ratios between these metabolites  may affect the therapeutic potential and patients’ response (Russo,  2019). Secondary metabolism in plants is affected by exogenous factors  including environmental variables such as light intensity, light spec trum, mineral nutrition, plant architecture and temperature (Bernstein  et al., 2019a, 2019b; Gorelick and Bernstein, 2014, 2017). Light is  known to affect secondary metabolism by effects on both photosynthesis  and photomorphogenesis (Bian et al., 2015; Landi et al., 2020). A need  for standardization of the therapeutic compounds’ profile, is therefore a  major challenge in the development of cannabis for modern medicine,  which requires mechanistic understanding of the regulation of second ary metabolite biosynthesis, as well as precision agriculture techniques  for its standardization.  
To facilitate cultivation under uniform environmental conditions  and for generating a consistent product, there is a growing tendency for  cultivation of cannabis in controlled growing rooms, termed ’in-door’  cultivation in the cannabis jargon. In the ’in-door’ facilities, light is  supplied by artificial lighting. Since cannabis is a short-day plant, the  supplied light needs to satisfy the photosynthetic energy demands as  well as the spectrum required to trigger photoperiodic and photo 
morphogenetic responses. Several types of lights are being used nowa days in agricultural production systems, and in the cannabis industry,  albeit very little science-based information is available on the response  of cannabis to light spectrum for directing optimal precision agriculture  practices. These include high intensity discharge lamps (HID) such as  Metal Halide (MH) or High-pressure sodium (HPS); fluorescent lights  and Light Emitting Diodes (LED). The lighting fixtures range in intensity  and spectrum. Fluorescent fixtures vary in spectrum- with a high peak in  the shorter wavelengths and decreased intensity with the increase in  wavelength; HPS is red and far-red rich; MH is relatively uniform in  intensity at all wavebands; and LEDs can be costume-made to cover  desired regions of the spectrum (Wang et al., 2017). This study takes  advantage of recent advances in LED technologies for generation of  wavelength variations, for deciphering the effects of wavelength on  cannabis growth, development, yield and chemical properties.  
Very little and incomplete information is available about responses  
of cannabis to light in general, and light quality in particular. Photo synthetic photon flux density up to 1500 μmol m− 2s− 1 was found to  increase net photosynthesis rate, and water use efficiency was highest  under 500–1500 μmol m− 2s− 1 (Chandra et al., 2008). We have identi fied short day photoperiodism as the inducing trigger for  morpho-development of inflorescences (Spitzer-Rimon et al., 2019). In  addition, some light spectra effects were recorded both under long and  short-day length. These include a slight reduction in height and leaf area  under red + blue light compared to white light during long photoperiod  (Lalge et al., 2017); lower plant and flowers biomass, but increased  cannabinoids levels under HPS compared to two LED lightning systems  (Magagnini et al., 2018); different chemical content under LED and  florescence lighting (Namdar et al., 2019); and an increase in inflores cence yield with light intensity up to 1500 μmol m− 2s− 1 regardless of  lamp type used (LED and HPS) and spectra emitted (white light, red,  blue), effects on the chemical profile were not reported (Eaves et al.,  2020). Response to spectral changes varies between crops (Hogewoning  et al., 2012) and cultivars, including effects on secondary metabolism  (Tinyane et al., 2013) and it is therefore important to assess responses in  cannabis of a diverse germplasm.  
In this study we focused on the effect of light spectrum on ’drug-type’  medicinal cannabis development and on the profile of cannabinoids, the  unique therapeutic secondary metabolites in cannabis sativa. The hy potheses guiding the workplan were i. Light spectrum induces changes  in the cannabinoid profile by affecting morpho-physiological responses.  ii. The ratio of Blue:Red light induces changes in the cannabidiome. iii.  Exposure to a wide (white light) spectrum at a given Blue:Red light ratio,  enhances growth and cannabinoid concentration compared to exposure  to only blue and red lights. iv. Genetic variability in the response to light  spectrum will impact the cannabinoid profile. To test these hypotheses,  we studied how four different light spectrums including white LED, two  ratios of blue + red LED (1:4 and 1:1), and a spectrum generated by HPS  (that is rich in the green to red wavelength range), affect the cannabi 
diome and morpho-physiological responses, comparatively in three  cannabis cultivars differing in chemotype. In addition to the contribu tion to cannabis physiology, the acquired information can help develop  precision-agriculture practices for increased specification and stan dardization of the chemical profile for the therapeutic modern medical  cannabis industry.  
2. Materials and methods  
2.1. Plant material and growing conditions  
Three ’drug-type’ medical cannabis (Cannabis sativa L) genotypes  differing in chemotype were used as the model system of study. CS10 is a  high CBDA low THCA variety, CS12 produces similar concentrations of  CBDA and THCA, and CS14 is a high THCA and low CBDA variety. The  plants were propagated from cuttings in coconut fiber plugs (Easy plug  CT 104, Goirle, the Netherlands). The rooted plantlets were planted in a  1 L square plastic pots in a growing mixture (50/50 coconut fibers/  perlite), 1 plant per pot, and were grown under long photoperiod of 18/  6 light/dark hours for 5 days for vegetative growth. The plants were then  transferred to a short-day regime (12/12 light/dark hours) in 4 growing  chambers, and each chamber was illuminated by a different light-quality  treatment. Five replicates plants per variety were grown in each cham ber. The growing chambers size was 1.1 m width and depth and 2.0 m  height, they were lined with reflective sheets, and contained an intake  and discharge vents at the bottom and top, respectively, and a fan to  enhance air circulation. The chambers were located in an environmen tally controlled room, temperature was maintained at 25 ◦C, humidity at  50 % and CO2 levels at 750− 800 ppm. CS12, which is less vigorous  compared to the other 2 varieties studied, was allowed a longer vege 
tative growth period of 24 days, under long photoperiod prior to the  transition to short days. Fertigation was delivered from a final solution,

by drip irrigation, 1 dripper per pot, via 1.2 L h− 1 drippers (Netafim, Tel Aviv, Israel), and the frequency of irrigations was adjusted from twice a  week at the beginning of cultivation to once daily at late flowering.  Fertilization was conducted with ’Coco forte’ a and b, 1.65 ml L− 1 each

The plants were exposed to 4 different light spectra that included 3  LED spectra compared to a control HPS light (Gavita pro 1000, Philips,  the Netherlands), which is a conventional HPS standard light for com mercial indoor cultivation. The LED treatments included a common  white LED lightning system (“Fluence”, Osram, Austin TX USA), which  consists of mostly “white” LED light which has ~1:1 red and blue (Blue:  Red) wavelength radiation ratio. The second LED treatment consisted as  well of ~1:1 Blue:Red light but with little to none “white” light back ground, and the third LED treatment favored red light to a ratio of 1:4  Blue:Red (Fig. 1 Table 1). The treatments are named: HPS, White-LED,  1:1 LED, and 1:4 LED. The 1:1, and 1:4 LED treatments were gener ated by adjustable LED lightning systems (’EVA3’, Flora Fotonica,  Israel). Light intensity increased gradually from the beginning of the  vegetative phase to reach 950 μmol m− 2s− 1 at the photosynthetic active  radiation (PAR) spectra fraction 10 days after the transition to short  photoperiod. The HPS and 1:4 LED treatment emit light also in the infra red zone at the level of up to 25 % of the intensity given at the PAR  range.  
2.3. Chemical responses: cannabinoid concentrations  
To evaluate effects of the different light spectra on the cannabinoid  profile, apical inflorescences were sampled for cannabinoid analyses  from the top of the main stem [primary inflorescence] and from the top  of a bottom branch [secondary inflorescence]. The tissue was sampled  for analyses 58 days after the transition to the short photoperiod, when  about 40 % of the trichomes were of amber color. The inflorescences  were hand trimmed, (i.e., tips of leaves protruding from the inflores 
cence were removed) as is routinely practiced in the cannabis industry.  Trimming was conducted prior to drying immediately after dissection  from the plant and fresh weight was determined. The inflorescences  were dried in the dark at 40 % relative humidity and 19◦C for 14 days, in  an environmentally-controlled room. The analysis was conducted for all  replicated plants per treatment, following the experimental design. For  the cannabinoid analysis, the dried inflorescences were ground with a  manual plastic grinder. Fifty mg of the ground tissue was placed in a  glass vial, 10 mL ethanol was added, and the tube was shaken in a

reciprocal shaker for 1 h at room temperature. The extract was filtered  through a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane filter of 0.22 μm  pore size (Bar-Naor ltd, Ramat Gan, Israel). Cannabinoid concentrations  in the filtered extracts were analyzed using a high performance liquid  chromatography (HPLC) system, (Jasco 2000 Plus series) which consist  of a quaternary pump, autosampler, column compartment and photo 
diode array (PDA) detector (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). The detection was  carried out in a spectrum mode, at the wavelength range 200− 650 nm.  Chromatographic separations were conducted with a Luna Omega 3 μm  Polar C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA USA) employing aceto 
nitrile:water 75:25 (v/v) with 0.1 % (v/v) formic acid, at the isocratic  mode, with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute. Quantification of cannabinoid  concentrations were based on analytical standards: CBGA, CBN, CBD,  CBDA (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany); and THCV, Δ9-THCA (THCA-A), Δ9-  THC (Restek, Pennsylvania, USA). Concentrations of CBDV, CBG, THCV,  CBCV, CBN, CBNA, Δ8-THC, CBL and CBT were below the detection  limits. Linear R2 of all calibration curves were >0.994.  
2.4. Plant morphological development and biomass accumulation  
Non-destructive measurements of plant height were conducted  routinely throughout the experiment, every 7–14 days. At the termina tion of the experiment the plants were dissected for the analyses of plant  organ biomass. The plants were separated to fan leaves, stems and in florescences, and each were weighted for fresh weight determination  (Precisa 40SM-200A balance, Zurich, Switzerland). Inflorescences were  air dried at 19 ◦C and 40 % humidity following a conventional com mercial practice. The tips of the inflorescence leaves protruding from the  inflorescences were trimmed as is conventionally practiced for medical

and recreational use, and the biomass of the trim and the remaining  inflorescences were determined.  
2.5. Physiological responses  
All physiological tests were conducted with 5 biological repeats (i.e.,  5 replicated plants) per treatment, following the experimental design.  The measurements were conducted on the youngest mature leaf on the  main stem to facilitate comparison of tissue of similar physiological age.  Reported results are averages ± SE.  
2.5.1. Photosynthetic pigments and gas exchange parameters  Concentrations of the photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a, chlo rophyll b and carotenoids were determined as described previously  (Gorelick et al., 2015). In short, five discs 0.6 cm in diameter were cut  from the youngest mature leaf on the main stem and kept in 80 %  ethanol. Pigments were extracted following (Gorelick et al., 2015), and  concentrations were calculated following Lichtenthaler and Wellburn  (1983). Photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance,  and intercellular CO2 (Ci) were measured using a portable meter  (LI-COR 6400XT LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Water use efficiency  (WUEi) was calculated by dividing the assimilation rate by the tran spiration rate as of Eq. (1) (Farquhar et al., 1982).  
Water use efficieancy (%) = photosynthesis rate 
transpiration rate *100 (1)  
2.5.2. Membrane leakage  
For membrane leakage measurements, the youngest mature leaf on  the main stem was washed twice in distilled water, and the middle  leaflet was shaken for 24 h in 50 mL distilled water in a closed vial. EC  was measured twice, after 24 h of shaking, and again after autoclaving  for 20 min in 120 ◦C and cooling to room-temperature. The percentage  of ion leakage from the tissue, i.e., ‘Membrane leakage’, was calculated  as the percentage of the first EC measurement results from the second  measurement result.  
2.5.3. Osmotic potential  
About 200 mg of tissue from the center of the youngest mature leaf  on the main stem was washed twice in distilled water, blotted dry, and  placed into a 1.7 mL Eppendorf tube and immediately frozen. After  partial thawing, the tissue was macerated in the vial and the cell sap was  extracted by centrifugation at 6000 rpm and 4 ◦C for 5 min (Sigma  Laboratory Centrifuges, Germany) as is described by Saloner et al.  (2019) The osmotic potential of the sap was analyzed with a  micro-osmometer (Gonotec, Berlin, Germany).  
2.5.4. Relative water content  
The second youngest mature leaf on the main stem was weighted for  fresh weight and immersed in distilled water for 24 h. The leaf was then  dried by blotting with paper towels, and weighted again for hydrated  weight, and then dried at 65 ◦C for 3 days and was weighted for dry  weight determination. Water content of the tissue was calculated by  subtracting the dry weight of the tissue from the fresh weight. The hy 
drated water content is the dry weight subtracted from the hydrated  weight. Relative water content of the tissue was calculated by dividing  the fresh water content by the hydrated water content and multiplied by  100 as is described by Bernstein et al. (2019b).  
2.6. Statistical analysis  
The analysis was performed with the Jump software (version 9, SAS  2015, Cary, NC, USA). The data were subjected to one-way ANOVA (α < 0.05) followed by Tukey’s HSD test. The data met the assumptions of  normality and homogeneity of variances.  
3. Results  
3.1. Chemical response  
Cannabinoids are biosynthesized in the plants in acidic, carboxyl ated, forms that are later decarboxylated in the plant or post-harvest, to  the active forms. Fig. 2 represents the combined concentrations of both  carboxylated and decarboxylated forms of major cannabinoids and the  percentage of decarboxylation. CBGA, the precursor of the major can nabinoids (THCA, CBDA and CBCA) was considerably affected by light  spectra and demonstrated the highest variability and the most distinct  response to light spectrum (Fig. 2A–C). The results demonstrate that  blue light induces accumulation of CBGA in cannabis. Accordingly,  White LED plants and 1:1 LED plants that had the highest proportions of  blue light amongst all treatments, accumulated the highest levels of  CBGA in all three varieties; plants exposed to the 1:4 LED treatment had  similar or lower concentrations of CBGA, and plants cultivated under  HPS light, which has the least amount blue light, always had the lowest  concentration of CBGA (Fig. 2A–C). Unlike CBGA, concentrations of  CBDA (Fig. 2D–F) were higher when grown with a low blue light ratio  (HPS) than under high proportion of blue light in two of the varieties  (CS10 and CS14). However interestingly, a contradictory response was  apparent for CS12 plans that demonstrated lower CBDA accumulation  when grown with low blue light supply (HPS, Fig. 2D–F) demonstrating  a genotypic variability. Similarly, THCA (Fig. 2G–I) accumulation varied  between the varieties with HPS decreasing THCA levels in CS14 and  CS12, but increasing THCA levels in CS10. CBCA on the other hand  (Fig. 2J–L), was least accumulated under the 1:4 LED treatment, but the  differences between treatments were minor.  
The extent of decarboxylation varied between the varieties and be tween cannabinoids but was not significantly affected by the light  treatments. For example, the percentages of CBD out of the combined  CBD + CBDA content in CS10 (high CBDA Fig. 2F) were 1.6–2.0 % in all  treatments and at both locations. Similarly, THC in the balanced variety  (CS12 Fig. 2H) ranged from 5.1-8.9 %. CS14 (high THCA) showed some  variation from this trend and the extent of decarboxylation was greater  for both THCA (4.1–10.7 %) and CBCA (24.5–40.9 %) (Fig. 2G, J). CBD  levels for this variety were very low and under the detection limits. In  most cases (68 % of the samples), the extent of decarboxylation was  higher at the top [primary] inflorescence than the bottom [secondary]  inflorescences. In addition, in most cases cannabinoid levels of the top  inflorescence were higher than or similar to concentrations of the lower  inflorescence. Four exceptions to this trend are the extent of decarbox 
ylation of CBGA and CBCA in the 1:4 LED treatment in CS10 (the high  CBD variety), and THCA levels of CS12 (balanced) and CS14 (high  THCA) in the HPS treatment.  
3.2. Morphological response  
Photomorphogenetic response under short photoperiod was recor ded by weekly height measurements (Fig. 3). For both the high THCA  and high CBDA varieties (Fig. 3A, C) the tallest plants developed under  the 1:4 LED spectrum, followed by the HPS. Both the 1:1 and the white  LED treatments sustained shorter plants. Both lines increased in height  during the first 19 days under short photoperiod by 40− 50 cm, resulting  in plants four to five times taller than at the start of the reproductive  phase. During the following 34 days, the plants grew in height up to an  additional 7 cm (with CS14 of the 1:4 treatment being an exception by  growing an additional 17 cm). The morphological response of the  balanced variety (Fig. 3B) differed, with red + blue LED treatments  stimulating development of taller plants compared to both the HPS and  white LED, and the extent of elongation over the flowering duration  smaller compared to the other two lines (up to 17 cm). Cannabis is  known to have a growth spurt at the beginning of the reproductive  phase, with elongation of 10–200 % of their initial height, and this  growth is cultivar specific. The duration of the vegetative period was

adjusted for each cultivar based on prior knowledge of the elongation  dynamic at the onset of the reproductive phase, to reach a similar final  height of about 60 cm at maturity.  
An additional morphological response that was affected by the light  quality treatments is biomass deposition and partitioning between the  plant organs. Plants of the 1:1 LED treatment always produced the most  biomass, which was equal to some other treatments in the different  cultivars. For example, similar flower biomass was developed by the  white LED plants of the high THCA line (Fig. 4A); by the 1:4 LED plants  in the balanced line (Fig. 4B); and by the 1:4 LED and HPS plants in the  high CBDA line (Fig. 4C). Overall, biomass of the remaining plant organs  responded similarly to the inflorescences biomass, with some statisti cally significant variations, such as different floral biomass in the white  LED and 1:1 LED treatments in the high CBDA line.  
3.3. Physiological characteristics  
Photosynthesis rate (Fig. 5D-F) was highest in the 1:1 and 1:4 LED  treatments in all three varieties and did not differ statistically from the  rates obtained for HPS for CS10, and white LED for CS14. Stomatal  conductance and transpiration rate responded similarly (Fig. 5A-C, G–I),  with the 1:1 LED treatment allowing the greatest gas exchange, and for  CS14 white LED had similar results. The lowest intracellular CO2 levels  (Fig. 5J–L) were always detected in the HPS’ plants, and in CS12 and  CS10 also in the white LED plants. In 2 of the 3 studied lines (CS10 and  CS12) the highest intercellular CO2 concentrations were found in the 1:1  and 1:4 LED treatments, and in CS14 in the 1:1 and the white LED plants.  
The plants also responded to the changing light spectrum by pro ducing different concentrations of the light harvesting pigments chlo rophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids. Chlorophyll a (Fig. 6A–C) was  most abundant in the 1:1 LED treatment in all varieties, while the least  accumulation occurred in the HPS and 1:4 LED plants. The order of  chlorophyll a abundance was 1:1 LED > white LED>HPS≅ 1:4 LED.  Similarly, the highest and lowest accumulation of carotenoids  (Fig. 6G–I) occurred in the 1:1 LED and the HPS plants, respectively.  Carotenoid concentrations under white LED did not differ significantly  from the 1:1 plants’ concentrations. The response of chlorophyll b pro duction to the light treatment varied between the lines (Fig. 6D-F). It  was unaffected by the treatments in CS12; was lowest in the1:4 LED  plants in both other lines, as well as in the HPS plants in the high THCA  line.  
The two water relations parameters tested, osmotic potential and  RWC were unaffected by the treatments in the three lines tested (Fig. 7D F, J–L). Similarly, membrane leakage, which is a stress measure of  oxidative damage, was not affected by the treatments (Fig. 7A–C).  ’Water use efficiency’, which is derived from the stomatal conductance  and photosynthetic rate results, was significantly affected by the light  spectrum treatments. The most water efficient treatment was HPS, with  white LED having similar results in both CS12 and CS10. The least water  efficient treatment was always 1:1 LED, with white LED for CS14 and 1:4  
LED for CS10 not-significantly differing from the 1:1 LED value.  4. Discussion  
In the medicinal cannabis industry, yield and chemical profile has a  major impact on patient welfare (Russo, 2019). Achieving certain at tributes in the plant product, such as increased cannabinoids levels, or  different ratio of CBDA to THCA can lead to a change in pharmaceutical  potential and use (Gorelick and Bernstein, 2017). Secondary metabolism  in plants, including cannabis, is influenced by environmental cultivation  conditions (Bernstein et al., 2019a, 2019b; Saloner et al., 2019)  including light. This study examined the hypothesis that changes in light  spectra can induce a change in the chemical profile, as was observed for  different crops (Landi et al., 2020; Ouzounis et al., 2015). The high  number of plant blue and red light absorbing pigment super families  (such as chlorophyll a,b (Qiu et al., 2019), Phytochrome a–e (Rockwell  and Lagarias, 2020), cryptochrome 1–2 (Brudler et al., 2003), photo 
tropin 1–2 (Briggs et al., 2001), along with results from studies on effects  of these lights on plant development, suggest that the ratio between blue  and red light, could have strong effects on plant development, espe cially, in term of yield quality and quantity.  
In other species valued for their secondary metabolites, improved  chemical traits were seen under exposure to different light spectra. In  the medicinal plant Hypericum (Hypericum perfuratum), elevated levels  of hypericin, pseudohypericin and hyperforin were produced under red  light compared to white or blue light (Nishimura et al., 2007). Sweet  basil (Osimum basilicum) leaves had increased levels of myrcene, 1,8-cin 
eol and linalool when grown under monochromatic blue light compared  to either white, red, green or blue-green light, but this increase was not  observed for α-Pinene and β-pinene (Amaki et al., 2011) demonstrating  quantitative as well qualitative effects. In the current study, we show  that the cannabinoid profile was affected by the cultivation light spec 
trum. The largest impact was on the accumulation of the primary  cannabinoid CBGA, that was up to 400 % higher in the LED treatments  compared with the HPS control (Fig. 2A–C); while the concentrations of  some of the primary cannabinoids (THCA, CDBA or CBCA) (Fig. 2D-L)  decreased under LED cultivation but to a lesser extent (up to 40 %  reduction), exhibiting metabolite specific response to light spectra, and  a potential of inhibition of the metabolic enzymatic transformations  under LED light. A similar response in scope was detected for cannabis  by Magagnini et al. (2018), but higher cannabinoid concentrations, were  measured under LED lighting compared with HPS. A less pronounced  response to change in light quality in cannabis was shown by Hawley  et al. (2018), though the differential light spectrum in this study was  imposed by sub-canopy lighting (with a similar overhead spectrum, and  some variability also in light intensity which may have masked the light  quality effects). The reduced response was likely due to the smaller  fraction of light that was altered, or due to a varied response to the  monochromatic enhancement tested in the study.  
Similar cannabinoid concentrations was seen in our study in the two

locals tested, i.e., primary and secondary inflorescences (Fig. 2). This  likely reflects the small micro-climatic changes along the plants that  were cultivated as is common for industrial indoor cultivation, i.e. small  and non-dense plants which support homogenous light distribution.  Commercial greenhouse cannabis cultivation usually includes bigger  plants that shade one another resulting in micro-climate gradient within  the canopy and specifically different spectral properties along the plant  height. As leaves absorb mainly blue and red light, the light that reaches  lower layers of the canopy is depleted in these zones of the spectrum,  with mostly green and far-red light reaching the lower parts of the plant  (Smith et al., 2017). These longitudinal variations in spectral properties  along the plant axis, under both indoor and greenhouse cultivation,  should be taken under consideration as light quality affects the canna binoid profile. Hence, smaller, less dense plants and sub-canopy lighting  have a potential to increase spectral and chemical uniformity.  
Morphological development and physiological function of the  cannabis plants were altered by light spectra (Figs. 3–7). Responses of  plants to defined zones of the light spectrum are highly studied, and  display variabilities as well as overlapping responses to different frac 
tions of the spectrum. Blue light response, mediated through the cryp tochrome and phototropins photoreceptors, include general responses  such as de-etiolation, increased stomatal conductance and development,  
photoperiodic flowering and circadian clock regulation, but also species  specific responses such as leaf senescence in soybean (Yang et al., 2017).  In Arabidopsis, lack of blue light promotes stem elongation as a shade  avoidance response (Keller et al., 2011; Keuskamp et al., 2011). Similar  responses in plants are also regulated by the phytochrome super family  that react to the red: far-red (R:FR) ratio of the spectrum (Franklin and  Quail, 2010).  
High percentage of red light (that were applied in the 1:4 LED and  HPS treatments) stimulated development of elongated plants  (Fig. 3A–C), this is usually attributed to the activity of phytochromes  which are the active receptors in the shade avoidance response (Franklin  and Whitelam, 2005). HPS lights are rich in the far-red fraction of the  spectrum and the HPS plants have elongated considerably, but the  decreased R:FR ratio of the 1:4 treatment should have prevented stim 
ulation of elongation growth, suggesting that at least partially, the lack  of blue light is the cause of elongation in cannabis as described for other  crops as well (Keller et al., 2011). In petunia (Petunia X hybrida),  addition of blue light reduced elongation, while reduction of far-red and  addition of red induced generation of the most compact plants (Gautam  et al., 2015). These results partially correlate to the cannabis response,  as lack of blue light stimulated elongation as seen for both the 1:4 LED  and HPS treatments, as well as by the development of more compact

plants when grown under the 1:1 and white LED treatments. However, it  contradicted it since the 1:4 LED treatment had a high R:FR ratio but  resulted in elongated rather than compact plants. In roses and tomatoes,  HPS light increased plant height compared to red and blue LED light  (Blue:Red = 1:2), implying yet again that the high R:FR ratio combined  with the low levels of blue cause plant stretching (Bergstrand et al.,  2016). It is also possible that not only relative amount of blue light is the  cause of such elongation response but rather the absolute amount. In  soybean and radish for example, low amounts of blue light induced plant  elongation, while under total higher irradiance plants remained at the  same height even under different blue light ratios (Cope and Bugbee,  2013).  
High biomass and yield are usually achieved by high photosynthesis  rate which is most affected by light intensity, light absorption and  photosynthetic efficiency (Qu et al., 2017). The 1:4 and 1:1 LED plants of  2 of the tested varieties showed higher photosynthesis rate (Fig. 5D-F),  higher yield and total plant biomass compared with the white LED plants  (Fig. 4). Similar to our results, in wheat, photosynthesis rate was highest  under pink light- similar to 1:1 Blue:Red light, and lowest under culti 
vation with mostly blue light (75 % of the total PAR). Under fluorescent  white light (that is closest to our white LED treatment) the assimilation  rate was statistically similar to both a blue and a high red treatments  (Blue:Red 1:5) that demonstrated low photosynthesis rates (Monostori  et al., 2018). In the same study, biomass accumulation was similar in all  treatments except the blue light, but yield was highest under exposure to  red light with high far red ratio, and lower under pink, red (with low far  red), and blue light, implying that light spectrum influences allocation of  assimilates. In rice, different assimilation efficiencies were observed  under different light intensities (Qu et al., 2017). According to Zhen and  Bugbee (2020), far-red light should be taken under advise when  considering PAR irradiance as it contributes to photosynthesis and  biomass gain. Unfortunately, we did not detect such enhancing effect for  cannabis, which is cultivated in many indoor facilities with far-red rich  HPS lamps. Since photosynthesis is the source of organic matter for the  plant, photosynthesis rate is expected to be reflected in biomass  
accumulation. The lack of correlation between photosynthesis rate and  biomass gain, which was apparent in our results for example for CS14  (that under 1:4 LED lights had high photosynthesis rate but low yield)  (Figs. 4A and 5D), could be attributed to variability between treatments  in respiration or biosynthesis of high-energy compounds. It cannot be  excluded that this result may to some extent reflect the testing method,  since at the instantaneous photosynthesis analyses the studied tissue was  illuminated by the LI-COR measuring device with a unified light quality.  Additionally, whole plant photosynthesis, light intensity and quality  within the canopy may also play a part in whole plant development and  especially in biomass and yield accumulation. Lastly, lower transpira tion rate, which reduces intra-cellular CO2 levels (Fig. 5A–C), as well as  reduced photosynthetic pigment concentrations (Fig. 6) could have  inhibited photosynthesis (Fig. 5D-F) at the whole plant level.  
Increased yield could be also attributed to chlorophyll accumulation  and CO2 availability. Chlorophyll biosynthesis and stomatal conduc tance are both stimulated by phototropins activation by the blue  wavelength light (Boccalandro et al., 2012; Im et al., 2006). In this  study, we have used two treatments with high percentage of blue light  (1:1 and White LED) and both stimulated pigment biosynthesis (Fig. 6)  and transpiration (Fig. 5A–C). Similarly, higher chlorophyll content  under LED (Blue:Red 1:2) compared to HPS light was seen in both roses  and tomatoes (Bergstrand et al., 2016). The elevated pigment concen 
tration likely facilitated the higher photosynthesis rate identified in this  study, with the accompanied higher stomatal conductance facilitating  sufficient aeration of the mesophyll tissue thus preventing limiting levels  of CO2 (Fig. 5K-L). In support of this finding, a linear relation between  chlorophyll concentration and photosynthesis rate was reported before.  For example, in papaya (Carica papaya), genotypes with lower chloro 
phyll concentrations had lower photosynthetic assimilation rates,  biomass accumulation and yield (Paixao ˜ et al., 2019). It is possible that  the differences in photosynthesis were larger then could have been  detected by the measurements which utilized uniform instantaneous  lighting at the pulse of the measurement period, suggesting a combined  role for pigment concentrations and photosynthesis rate in the reduced

biomass deposition.  
In a study by (Magagnini et al., 2018) a decrease in yield by LED light  compared with HPS light was seen in one of two crop cycles. Such a  decrease in yield was not seen in our study, nor in a study by Eaves et al.  (2020) that observed a linear relation between light intensity and floral  yield, which was not affected by light quality. As the results available so  far suggest either increase, decrease or similar growth of inflorescences  under different LED lights and spectra, further study of cultivar or  spectra dependent effects is called for. Further analysis of light quality  effects on photosynthesis along the plant height, during plant develop ment and on a whole plant scale, are required to shed more light on  cannabis physiological response and for directing optimization of  cannabis cultivation.  
5. Conclusions  
Light spectrum affected almost all tested attributes in this study,  including morphological, physiological and chemical parameters. Using  three cultivars differing in chemotype, we found some cultivar dependent responses, suggesting genetic variance, which opens up op portunities for breeding for enhanced light induced responses in  cannabis. Furthermore, 2 water relations parameters, and an oxidative stress related parameter, were not affected by the light quality treat ments in all three varieties used, which implies that the light spectra has  
low effect on cannabis water relations. Results of this study supported  three of the proposed hypotheses including genetic variability in  response to light spectrum, effect of Blue:Red light ratio on cannabis  plant growth and the cannabinoid profile, but contradicted the hy 
pothesis of a positive effect of full spectrum on yield. The results indicate  that it is possible to alter the cannabinoid profile in cannabis by  manipulation of the light spectrum, and suggest an interplay between  genetics and light quality as a promising avenue for customizing the  bioactive profile for the benefit of both patients and growers.
