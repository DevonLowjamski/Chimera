Richard Evans Schultes (1915-2001) was born, raised, and worked most of his life

in and around his beloved Harvard University, where he was an undergraduate

and graduate student and then a longtime professor of botany and director of the

Botanical Museum.    However, Dick, as he liked us to call him, is best known for

his 13 years of field research in the upper Amazon Basin, principally in Colombia.

One of his several well-known and very accomplished graduate students, Wade

Davis, wrote a well-received book (One River, Simon & Schuster, 1996) that features

the challenging and engaging experiences of Professor Schultes among numerous

indigenous groups in remote tropical rainforest regions of northern South America.

Readers are encouraged to read Davis’s book and appreciate the zeal and fortitude of

Schultes’s botanical and cultural explorations but, more important, to fathom the

profound human-plant relationships of the native people whom he befriended and

deeply respected. Schultes was especially sensitive to the ecological, spiritual, and

medicinal plant relationships that indigenous peoples developed throughout the

world. His profound research and mentorship have become almost legendary. The

authors of this book are among the many students, scientists, and scholars who have

been deeply inspired by the scientific goals and methodologies of our dear friend,

Dick Schultes. We dedicate this book to his memory and celebrate his many contribu-

tions to ethnobotany, of which he is certainly one of our modern founding fathers.

                        Introduction to the Multipurpose Plant Cannabis

                       Throughout the ages, [Cannabis] has been extolled as one of man’s greatest benefactors—
                         and cursed as one of his greatest scourges. [Cannabis] is undoubtedly an herb that has
                         been many things to many people. Armies and navies have used it to make war, men
                         and women    to make love. Hunters and fishermen have snared the most ferocious crea-
                        tures, from the tiger to the shark, in its Herculean weave. Fashion designers have dressed
                        the most elegant women in its supple knit. Hangmen have snapped the necks of thieves
                           and murderers with its fiber. Obstetricians have eased the pain of childbirth with its
                         leaves [female flowers]. Farmers have crushed its seeds and used the oil within to light
                        their lamps. Mourners have thrown its seeds [inflorescences] into blazing fires and have
                            had their sorrow transformed into blissful ecstasy by the fumes that filled the air.

height with medium length internodes and less developed branching, small light to medium green leaves with narrow leaflets, and small, leafy

oldest cultivated plants have multiple uses, such as flax (Linum
usitatissimum) for seed and fiber and opium poppy (Papaver
somniferum) for seed and medicine. Diverse usage of a plant
is a strong indication of how long humans have been associ-
ated with that species (Ames 1939) and perhaps why they were
initially attracted to it. Cannabis provides multipurpose and
accessible plants, especially for well-situated, folk living in rela-
tively mild temperate climates along fresh waters. Ecological
relationships between these early fishers and Cannabis, at least
in parts of Eurasia, support the notion that Cannabis was one
of our oldest important plant resources and why it may have
been among the earliest cultivated plants.
   Cannabis can be found growing wild, or at least self-sown,
in many parts of Eurasia, especially in Central Asia where
it is adapted to slopes of undulating foothills and moun-
tains up to several thousand meters above sea level depend-
ing on latitude. It also grows spontaneously on rich, fertile
alluvial ground of river flood plains and valley bottoms and
frequently in recently disturbed open environments along
streams. Environments of this last type are quite often cre-
ated by the independent or complementary work of streams
and humans. Erosion and depositional actions of stream flow
produce open environments by scouring the terrain and
dumping mud, sand, and gravel in new places. People, who
disturb the mantle of vegetation, affect waterways by increas-
ing erosion and deposit nutrient-rich waste in dump heaps
near their streamside residences.
   When early hunter-gatherer-fishers settled down along
stream-scoured    banks, they cleared some of the surrounding
land and constructed shelters. In removing vegetation they
helped create one of nature’s relatively rare environments—             FIGURE 7. Mature female inflorescences containing relatively large

   During the early Holocene in Southwest Asia, and per-
haps in parts of China such as the Huang He (Yellow River)
and Yangzi River watersheds—where farming may have
originated independently     and megalithic civilizations
evolved—climatic conditions were favorable for incipient
agriculture. However, alluvial lowlands in the river basin
areas of the Tigris, Euphrates, Nile, and Indus River valleys
were still quite arid in this period of prehistory. Although
the annual flooding of alluvial plains brought new soil,
fresh   nutrients,   and   moisture     to certain       lowland    valleys,
the magnitude and seasonality of the moisture deficit
necessitated a certain degree of social organization and per-
haps subdivision of labor for flood control, irrigation con-
struction, and canal maintenance             (Hawkes      1964; Bellwood
2005).
   Therefore, it was in the hills or uplands of Southwest Asia
(or other regions of Eurasia such as China) that systematic
farming most likely began, especially in places where rainfall
was adequate for “dry farming,” and wild, potentially culti-
vable, annual plants already grew. Over time, some combina-
tion of social stratification, population pressure, and perhaps
innate initiative precipitated the diffusion of peoples and
culture from small upland settlements into the semiarid riv-
erside lowlands of Southwest Asia, or other areas such as the
lower Huang He and Yangzi River basins, where large-scale
civilizations began. Between 8000 and 7000 BP, early farm-
ers moved into the lowlands of the Tigris and Euphrates and
eventually into the Huang He, Nile, and Indus River valleys; it
was in these regions that large-scale “hydraulic” civilizations
and associated monumental architecture first appeared. In
the section that follows, we elaborate on our hypothesis that
the first use of Cannabis took place within its native range in
Central Asia, and it was subsequently grown in many regions
of early civilization, such as China, India, and other areas of
Eurasia.                                                                          FIGURE 8. Cannabis’s fibers would have been obvious to early

 NOTE: Stalks provide fiber used to twist cordage and yarn, weave textiles, and make paper. Medicinal remedies are made from all parts of the plant,
 especially the female flowers and seeds; the female flowers also provide psychoactive drugs. Seeds and seed oil provide vital dietary requirements for
 humans and livestock as well as biofuels and industrial oils, and all plant parts are used in various ritual contexts. Cannabis is an iconic example of an
 economic plant with a long history of human use and serves as an excellent educational tool. Populations perform valuable ecological functions; most
 importantly humans find satisfaction in aesthetic appreciation of its attributes.

of maturation times. The very early maturing or very late
maturing exceptions that escape removal are the only pollen
plants with a possibility to fertilize seed plants. These two fac-
tors, working together, result in offspring that either tend to
mature particularly early or particularly late, with fewer plants
of intermediate maturation. This type of disruptive selection
does not significantly alter the sex ratio, but it does influence
the maturation characteristics of the population.
    Pollen introduced from intersex plants can also change the
sexual expression of subsequent generations. Intersex plants
can range from being fully monoecious, with approximately
equal numbers of male and female flowers produced contem-
poraneously throughout the floral phase, to those that are only
slightly intersex and produce only a few flowers of the oppo-
site sex, either male or female appearing at different, but often
overlapping, times during floral maturation. True hermaphro-
dites, with both male and female organs borne together within
the same flower, are very rare and not often fully fertile. In             FIGURE    10.   Pistillate (female) inflorescences with staminate

occurrence of Cannabis. Cord and textile scraps as well as
fiber impressions in pottery and bronze figures have been
cited as early evidence of Cannabis in Asia. Pollen evidence
has proven especially useful in establishing the early range
of the Cannabaceae (Cannabis and/or Humulus) in Europe.
Cannabis trichomes and phytoliths are resistant to decay and
burning and as noted earlier are also occasionally recovered.
Carbonized remains are relatively rare and are confined to
eastern Africa and southern Europe. Cannabinoid com-
pounds unique to the genus Cannabis have also occasionally
been identified. Various types of physical evidence allow us
to supplement historical records concerning the origin and
early diffusion of Cannabis. The various classes of Cannabis
archeological evidence are discussed in more detail later.

   In sum, both ancient Chinese texts and archeological evi-
dence suggest that Cannabis use in China for medicine, fiber,
and food, as well as ritual and ecstatic purposes, reaches back
into the early Neolithic period and perhaps to the late Paleo-
lithic. Although Cannabis likely originated farther to the west
than East Asia, in pre-Pleistocene times, it may have taken
refuge in southern East Asia during the later Pleistocene gla-
ciations (see Chapters 2 and 12). China was certainly one of
the early regions of elaboration of its many uses, if not the
birthplace of Cannabis agriculture. Over time, the emphasis
on medicinal, ritual, and ecstatic use of Cannabis declined in             FIGURE 15. Three female figurines from the lid of a Dian King-

126     THE CULTURAL      DIFFUSION   OF CANNABIS
Nelson provide secondary sources of information regarding
Cannabis history, the confirmation of supposed remains of
Cannabis fiber in Egypt will depend on the support of verifi-
able primary written sources presently unavailable and more
significantly on reliable fiber analyses. In addition, Leroi-
Gourhan (1985) reported her identification of Cannabis and
Gossypium (cotton) pollen found in the mummy of Ramsés
Il (lived 1279 to 1212 Bce) and referred to both species as
introduced crops in Egypt. She also referred to Cannabis pol-
len found at “Nagada Khattara near Luxor in Egypt which
was dated to ca. 2600 BC[E]” (see Chapter 5 for further details
about these intriguing but problematic discoveries). It should
also be noted here that controversial evidence in the form of
psychoactive Cannabis resin residue was reportedly found in
the body tissues of several ancient Egyptian mummies that
may support medical or ritual use by early Egyptians (Bala-
banova et al. 1992).
   Northern and southern areas of Africa are separated by the
extensive Sahara Desert and therefore the cultural dispersal
of Cannabis basically followed two paths, one above and one
below this great natural obstacle. Although there is some cir-
cumstantial evidence that hemp fiber may have been used in
ancient Egypt, in areas both north and south of the Sahara,
Cannabis use was focused primarily, if not exclusively, on pro-
duction and consumption of its mind-altering resin rather
than its fiber and seed products. North of the Sahara, Can-
nabis spread through Egypt, where it has been cultivated
since at least the twelfth century and eventually westward
with Muslim traders across sub-Mediterranean North Africa
all the way to present-day Morocco. Muslim traders also car-
tied Cannabis down the eastern coast of Africa from where it
spread inland throughout many tropical and semitropical sub-
Saharan regions. Its cultural diffusion across Africa was likely
slow because sedentary farming cultures were sparsely distrib-
uted within this huge region, only reaching West Africa fol-
lowing World War II (Phase 4). Emboden (1972) pointed out
that complex methods of preparing and using Cannabis in the
Mediterranean or Near East regions (e.g., sieving hashish) were

use of hemp fiber for making cordage and clothing, as well as
oily hemp seeds for porridges and other foods, was most likely
based on local cultivation (La Barre 1977). Although people
probably began to produce hemp cordage before the Neolithic
Age (Good 2001) and started to weave hemp clothing some-
what later, up until the end of the medieval period “the history
of fabrics is recorded on just a few shreds of cloth whose exact
features are difficult to determine” (de Bonneville 1994).
  From an ancient point of view, fiber plants such as hemp
and their use to produce tools and clothing could have played
a pivotal role in the cultural transition from hunting and
gathering to farming, perhaps more so than food plants (Gil-
ligan 2007; also see Sauer 1952,1969).
      Long, durable hemp fibers offered numerous     resources for
early hunters, gatherers, and fishers, as well as for incipient
farmers. In addition to crude fibers, seeds and resin could be
extracted from wild Cannabis, probably well before the begin-
ning of agriculture. On the other hand, acquisition of suf-
ficient quantities of parallelized fiber for spinning yarn fine
enough to weave even quite rudimentary fabrics requires
hemp crops intentionally cultivated in closely spaced gardens
to promote growth of long and straight, unbranched stalks.
Although the very first use of Cannabis by ancient people
remains hidden by the veils of time, it is clear that an early
incentive to cultivate hemp was for fiber production, largely
used for cordage and clothing.
   There are two fundamentally different methods used to
make yarn suitable for weaving from bast (bark) fibers. Chi-
nese and other Asian weavers split hemp, nettle, and ramie
bark into narrow strips and tie them together end to end
to form yarn, while the European technique is to comb the
bark strips to isolate the individual fibers and then spin them
together. The Western approach to processing Cannabis fiber
is likely the result of adapting hemp fiber to already estab-
lished wool techniques and equipment, indicating that the            FIGURE 17. Along the Mekong River in northern Laos, twists of hemp

   Hemp fiber was commonly employed in lacquerware, dat-
ing back at least to Shang times more than 3,000 years ago.
Chinese lacquerware is well known for its hard finish, excel-
lent   construction,     and   beautiful   forms   and   has   remained
popular throughout history. In fact, lacquerware is not made
entirely from lacquer itself; it is only coated with a special lac-
quer varnish. The core material varies, ranging from bamboo,
rattan, or wood to metal or even plastic in the modern era. In
most    cases, traditional     lacquerware utilized bamboo        to pro-
vide the core shape, and strips of hemp cloth were integrated
into the object as it was varnished. According to Cheng
(1963), bamboo      and hemp cloth were “the chief material|[s]
used with plain lacquer as the foundation before the colored
fluid was applied.”
   Very early examples of lacquer work were found in tombs
of pre-Shang cultures living before the sixteenth century BCE.
Later, during the Warring States period and the Han dynas-
ties, great amounts of lacquerware were produced. Excavation

documents uncovered by Stein (1921) in the Dunhuang net-
work of military walls and watchtowers indicate that “silk and
hemp were both used for bow strings” (Andrews 1935). Abel
(1980, citing Eberland 1968) tells us that hemp fiber was such
an important crop for bowstring production that “Chinese
monarchs of old set aside large portions of land exclusively
for hemp, the first agricultural war crop.” Hemp crossbow
strings are still favored by traditional hunters in southwest-
ern China and northern Southeast Asia.
   Catapults with a simple lever-operated mechanism were
the “siege artillery par excellence” in medieval China, and
hemp fiber was also an integral part of these large assault
weapons since they all had a number of tightly twisted elas-

traditional East Asian technique of making hemp cloth. Dried bark strips are split into narrow strips (C),
joined together end-to-end (D), and spun (E) to secure the joins and form yarn. The tensioned warp yarns

Discovery of the Euphoriant Properties of
Cannabis in Eurasia

We believe that Paleolithic peoples discovered the euphori-
ant powers of Cannabis while foraging for food very early
on following their first arrival in its natural home range in
Central Asia; this discovery probably occurred before the
end of the last ice age, but certainly by the early Holocene as
early humans radiated from glacial refugia and long before
the advent of farming (see Chapters 1, 2, and 12). Cannabis                 FIGURE 37. An Indian sadhu or holy man smokes Cannabis from a

   The New World equivalent to seedless ganja is sinsemilla
(colloquial Spanish for seedless) marijuana. Ganja is most
often cultivated by removing male plants to prevent fertiliza-
tion of the females and prevent formation of seeds. In actual-
ity, removal of male plants is rarely complete and some, but
significantly fewer, seeds form. Many more seeds would form
if male plants were allowed to freely fertilize the females.
However,   intersex plants with both male and female     flowers
are fairly common in Indian varieties, and special workers
called podhars were employed to remove them (Prain 1904).
Throughout the nineteenth century, areas surrounding
Khandwa and Gwalior in central India and Bengal in east-
ern India were the largest producers and exporters of ganja to
the remainder of the Indian subcontinent. Much of this legal
ganja was exported to the Northwest Territories and the Pun-
jab region along the Indus River (Clarke 1998a); these were the
ancient lands of the Vedas where Cannabis use was prevalent.
One of the few remaining seedless ganja cultures was located
in Kerala along the western shore of the southern tip of India.

This passage also could describe a typical pleasant experi-

the effects of orally imbibed Cannabis are sometimes much
more potent and unpredictable. Smoking Cannabis vapor-
izes the THC, which is absorbed immediately by the lungs,
passed without delay into the bloodstream, and straight
to the brain within a minute. When a person eats Canna-

the THC, changing it into 11-hydroxy-THC, which enters the
bloodstream an hour or more later and flows to the brain.
A more significant factor than the delay in onset is that
11-hydroxy-THC is approximately three times as potent as
plant-derived THC, and its profound effects can last for up to
24 hours (Clarke 1998a).
   Effects experienced from smoking even very potent Canna-

dramatic and long-lasting effects often experienced from eat-

distort time and space, induce deep introspection leading to
personality disintegration, and produce visions, and users

FIGURE 48. Several Cannabis varieties were used in popular late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century medicines                such as an Eli Lilly tincture
made from American-grown narrow-leaf drug (NLD) Cannabis (right), a British Drug House tincture of Indian-grown                   NLD Cannabis (center top),
and a Seabury’s Corn Plaster (bottom left). Present-day prescription Cannabis drugs include Sativex sublingual spray             (center), containing a blend
of THC from a hybrid NLD/BLD drug cultivar and CBD from a narrow-leaf hemp (NLH) cultivar, both grown in the                     United Kingdom. Marinol

260      NONPSYCHOACTIVE     RITUAL USES
   Possibly the most important achievements in a young
Hmong girl’s life are mastering the skills of hemp cultivation,
processing, spinning, weaving, and sewing her trousseau and
other hempen dowry items. Gu (1995) explains why hemp
fiber is so important to the Hmong:


 Miao [Hmong] girls still learn to spin and weave hemp
 cloth. If a girl cannot spin, weave, hand-stitch and embroi-
 der, she will have a difficult time finding a man willing
 to marry her. If a housewife cannot spin and weave hemp
 cloth, she is seen as incompetent. The level and quality of
 a woman’s cloth work is seen as a standard to judge if she is
 hard working and intelligent. A girl’s handicrafts are often
 the deciding factor in a boy’s choice of a mate. Therefore,
 young girls are eager to learn these skills from their moth-
 ers and aunts. They usually begin at the age of six or seven.
 By the time a young woman is 15 or 16 years old, she can
 design and produce her own blouses and skirts.


The dowry provides an important part of the Hmong wed-
ding, giving the young bride an opportunity to showcase her
vital domestic skills, and the most important element of a
bride’s dowry is the hempen clothing she has made for her-
self and her groom. The process from sowing seeds to sewing
clothing is lengthy and involved, spanning at least a spring
through autumn growing season and a winter of spinning

Korean funerary mourning is provided by Allen (1908):


  Mourning it may be inferred, is a serious matter in this
  erstwhile hermit kingdom. For a parent the family goes into
  mourning for a period of three years, during which time the
  sons don sackcloth and a rope girdle, sleep and live in a straw
  hut erected near their own comfortable dwelling, and indulge
  in the plainest of food with no luxuries, wine and music, with
  their accompaniments, being particularly prohibited. Should
  the mourner be obliged to venture out after a time, he must
  go clad in unbleached white raiment wearing a hat of fine
  woven material of about the size of an umbrella, while for
  greater privacy he wears a shield of sackcloth before his face.

   Korean mourning rituals mirror Chinese Confucian tradi-
tions from which they are derived. Korean ritual manuals and
etiquette books, modeled upon early Joseon dynasty statutes
and classical Chinese texts, specified in great detail which
relatives should wear certain items of the mourning costume
and for what length of time: “Throughout the variations in
theory and practice, only one principle remains inviolate;
the coarseness of the cloth or the number of items used must
correlate with     kinship distance”          (Janelli and Janelli        1982).

an Italian variety, possibly a NLH/BLH hybrid as well. ‘Kom-
polti Sargaszaru’ is a chlorophyll-deficient yellow-stemmed
cultivar   (registered   in   1974)   developed   as a raw   material
source for paper mills, where low chlorophyll content in
the stalks is of advantage during pulping. This cultivar was
obtained from a cross between ‘Kompolti’ and a spontaneous
yellow-stemmed mutant that Helle Stengel-Hoffmann found
in Germany in the offspring of a cross between Finnish early
maturing (NLH or NLHA) and Italian late-maturing hemp
(possibly an NLH/BLH hybrid), which was then repeatedly
backcrossed with ‘Kompolti.’
   Hungary is the only country where intentional heterosis
breeding of hemp was implemented under the direction of
Dr. Ivan Bocsa of the GATE Research Institute in Kompolt
(founded by Rudolph Fleischmann). This breeding for hybrid
vigor resulted in several F, hybrid cultivars. ‘Uniko-B’ is a
single-cross hybrid cultivar registered in 1969 and is the prog-        FIGURE 66. ‘Kompolti Sargaszaru’ or Kompolti “yellow stem” is a

able from distributors in Canada and across Western Europe.
Accompanying the availability of specially selected, hybrid
drug cultivars was relatively easy access to the technology
to produce uniform crops from vegetative cuttings indoors
under artificial grow lights. This combination has revolution-
ized sinsemilla production and heavily influenced the selec-
tion criteria of marijuana breeders.



Recent Trends in Cannabis Breeding

Further advances in industrial hemp breeding are expected
in the near future. Economical fiber production relies on
increasing the scale of production and reducing production
costs and could be achieved in part by breeding for increased
yield of biomass along with increased fiber yield and qual-
ity, reducing waste such as dust, and improving fiber color.
Experiments have shown that hemp has the potential to
produce much higher stalk and fiber yields than are pres-
ently achieved. Improved yields of both fiber and seed vari-
eties could be achieved by continued selection for optimal
flowering date, improved resistance to pests and diseases,
optimizing canopy architecture and improving fiber size,
aspect ratio, strength, stiffness, density, surface character-
istics, adhesive properties, lignification, and light color for      FIGURE 73. ‘Original Haze’ from Santa Cruz, California, is a late-

1929; Serebriakova 1940; Zhukovskii 1950). Russian stud-

C. indica is higher than that of C. sativa or C. ruderalis.
   After further study, Ernest Small (1979; also see Small
and Cronquist 1976) lumped all Cannabis plants back into
C. sativa, with a number of subspecies and varieties. Clarke
(1981) provided additional insight into this confusing taxo-
nomic situation, contending that all classifications to date are
“more semantic than scientific and data can be interpreted
differently by various taxonomists.” Clarke argued that the
uses of the plants “are our most important keys to distin-
guishing individual varieties, strains or species.” The biologi-
cal form and function of an individual organism, such as a
Cannabis plant, are determined by its genetic inheritance, the
environment      in which it lives, and the effects of natural and
artificial selection. Although the environment plays its role                         FIGURE 77. Harvard professor Dr. Richard Evans Schultes with small

various regions across the remainder of India (e.g., Kerala).
This region is peopled primarily by Hindu and Buddhist
religious groups of Tibeto-Burman or Indic heritage. Cha-
ras throughout this region has been traditionally produced
by rubbing the fresh resin glands from the pistillate inflo-
rescences by hand, subsequently collecting the rubbings
from the palms and pressing them into a shaped ball, rod,
or patty. Both cultivated and spontaneously growing NLD
plants are used for charas rubbing throughout this region;
these factors account for the distinctive aroma,             flavor, and
psychoactivity of Nepalese charas when compared with
Afghan sieved BLD hashish.

maturation raised problems with var. indochinensis when it
was grown in temperate latitudes. The only way to ensure
complete floral maturation was to protect the plants from
autumn weather in a glasshouse or grow them indoors
under lights. To overcome these problems, while preserving
their potency, Thai varieties were commonly used in hybrid
crosses with earlier-maturing NLD and BLD varieties (see
Chapter 10).
   Thai varieties are often partially monoecious with a pre-
ponderance of female individuals developing male flowers.
Up to 90 percent of the population will initially appear to
be female, and then, later in flowering, shoots of male flow-
ers will form along female limbs. Fertilization by pollen from
these late appearing male flowers is often quite effective and
many mature seeds form. As cosexual Cannabis is relatively
rare, we suspect the monoecious condition has evolved in
response to persistent selection for female plants in seedless
ganja production with male flowers on female plants over-
looked by farmers serving as the majority pollen donors and
thereby perpetuating the monoecious female trait.

World NLD populations into three types. Variety colombiana          spontanea   (NLHA)   and   C. indica   ssp. kafiristanica   (NLDA),

later. Variety jamaicana is slightly taller and matures from the    Kashmir, and Southeast Asia will also be of importance in
middle of October to the middle of December. Variety mexi-          unraveling the evolution of Cannabis. We hope that future

                                   Climate changes have caused the main modifications on the spatial
                                   distribution of organisms. Over the past millennia, human activity
                                     has also played a significant role in the distribution patterns of
                                   plants. Both factors, climatic and human, are considered fundamen-

resulting in the ecological isolation of the new entity from
its progenitor.” Newly evolved and highly adapted, divergent
populations are small, and longevity is only assured once
they multiply (Levin 2004).
   As long as expanding animal-pollinated plant popula-
tions are accompanied by their obligate pollinators, they
can spread more efficiently with an initially small popula-
tion size. The same holds true for self-pollinators. Wind-
pollinated, dioecious Cannabis requires a relatively larger
population size to simply reproduce successfully and produce
enough seed and plants for the next generation. However,
because Cannabis produces copious pollen and seed, fewer
individuals are required to ensure population stability and
promote expansion. Large population size is most important
to curtail inbreeding and ensure genetic diversity in subse-
quent generations.



Speciation Rate

When and how quickly did new species and subspecies arise
within Cannabis? Genetic divergence within a species, which
first leads to phenotypically distinct biotypes, then to sub-
species, and eventually new species, can occur at any time
during its evolution; however, many estimates of divergence
times (largely ecotype divergence rather than speciation
events) fall within the Quaternary, especially clustered “near
the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary” (Comes and Kadereit
1998) around 12,000 years ago when abrupt climatic changes

Reconstruction of a Cannabaceae Ancestor

Using evidence from its breeding system evolution, we can
begin to reconstruct a hypothetical ancestor to Cannabaceae.
If we assume that before Cannabis and Humulus diverged, their
common ancestor was already wind pollinated as they both
are, and we follow the evolutionary convention that wind pol-
lination is a condition derived from biotic pollination when
pollinators are absent (Guo et al. 2008), then most likely the
ancestor to Cannabaceae was hermaphrodite or monoecious
and visited by animal pollinators. However, evolution may
have been more economically direct, with Cannabaceae aris-
ing directly from wind-pollinated ancestors without evolution
and extinction of an intermediate animal-pollinated stage.
   Fossil remains of putative ancestors are helpful in recon-
structing early species ranges, as well as possible evolutionary
scenarios and hypothetical ancestors, but Cannabaceae-like
finds are quite rare. Zhilin (2006) reported the identification of   FIGURE 95. Female Cannabis inflorescences with pistillate bracts and
