**1\. Introduction**

**1.1. Project Vision**

Project Chimera is envisioned as an **ambitious multi-genre cannabis cultivation simulation**. It aims to blend several distinct game genres into a cohesive experience.

Key blended genres and inspirations include:

* **Detailed Infrastructure Management:** Drawing inspiration from Satisfactory and Cities: Skylines, focusing on intricate facility design involving plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems.  
* **Genetic Mastery:** A core pillar featuring complex and rewarding breeding mechanics, including trait discovery, advanced inheritance (alleles, dominant/recessive, polygenic, epistasis, pleiotropy), pheno-hunting, and stabilization.  
* **Creative Construction & Engineering:** Allowing granular control over facility design, layout, and the construction of interconnected utility networks (electrical, plumbing/irrigation, HVAC).  
* **Strategic Optimization & Management:** Requiring players to balance resources, environmental controls, genetic potential, operational efficiency, pest/disease management, and finances.  
* **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Emphasizing the collection, analysis, and interpretation of in-game data (environmental, plant health, genetic, financial) to inform strategic choices.  
* **Player-Driven Progression:** Providing meaningful advancement through unlocking technology, expanding operations, and achieving breeding goals.  
* **Farm Simulation:** Incorporating core crop growing dynamics similar to Farming Simulator and Stardew Valley.  
* **Collectable Marketplace Trading:** A planned future feature inspired by Runescape and EVE Online for trading items, especially genetics.  
* **Real-World Search/Find:** An initially considered but deferred/removed concept inspired by Pokemon GO and Ingress for acquiring rare genetics.

The ultimate goal is to **create the ultimate cannabis genetics** by mastering optimal growing conditions, cultivating superior strains, and perfecting breeding protocols. The vision requires **extensive research** into real-world cannabis genetics, breeding, and cultivation practices to ensure authenticity and depth.

**1.2. Narrative Framework & Motivation**

Project Chimera utilizes narrative as a **supportive, non-intrusive contextual layer**. The narrative aims to provide motivation for player actions, guide progression, and foster a sense of an evolving world, without being the primary focus. The main gameplay focus remains on **deep cannabis cultivation, breeding, research, and facility management simulation**.

The narrative enhances the "observe, learn, optimize" loop by framing the player's journey. The **player journey needs a starting point and an overarching drive**. The chosen premise is the **Entrepreneurial Innovator**. The player is an ambitious entrepreneur founding their own company, aiming for the best genetics and reputation in the industry. The company name is player-customizable.

The **core motivations** driving the player are:

1. **Achieving scientific breakthroughs** in cannabis genetics, pushing the boundaries of traits, stability, and cannabinoid/terpene profiles.  
2. **Building a reputable, successful company** based on quality, innovation, and ethical practices.  
3. **Potentially dominating market niches** such as high-efficacy medical, connoisseur recreational, or specialized industrial hemp.

The **narrative progression arc mirrors player growth**, moving from a small residential hobbyist operation to a state-of-the-art research/production facility and potentially beyond. This journey involves learning, facing challenges, making strategic investments, and scientific discovery.

A key narrative element is the **AI Advisor (ADA)**. ADA serves as a **guiding entity**. ADA is a **helpful AI**, a **functional AI Advisor**. Its presence is represented by an abstract logo, a clean modern UI element, or the facility's main computer "voice," aligning with a high-tech, clinical aesthetic. There is **no anthropomorphic character model** for ADA.

ADA's communication methods are primarily **text-based UI** (in-game inbox, panel notifications, pop-ups). **Synthesized voice-overs** are used sparingly for critical alerts, major milestones, and initial phase introductions to maintain impact and avoid annoyance. The voice is clear, neutral, and professional.

ADA's functions include:

* Delivering **new NPC contracts, research directives, and major narrative progression milestones**.  
* Providing **subtle contextual hints and reminders** about critical operational issues or deadlines.  
* Optionally offering **concise summaries of complex data reports** and highlighting significant findings at higher player progression or specific research unlocks.  
* Occasionally delivering **relevant in-world news snippets, industry developments, and scientific breakthroughs**for game world context.

**1.3. Aesthetic & Mood**

The core aesthetic is **Modern, High-Tech, Clinical/Scientific, and Aspirational/Professional**. Players have an option for a "Relaxed & Cozy" feel, which depends on player choice, scale, and potentially game mode. Large-scale operations lean towards high-tech/professional, while smaller setups (tents, closets) can feel cozier.

Key atmosphere keywords include **Realistic** (focused on function and detail, not grunge), **Clean**, **Detailed**, **Rewarding**, and **Engaging**.

Visual priorities are:

* **Cleanliness:** Striving for pristine, well-maintained assets and environments, avoiding excessive dirt, rust, grime, or spills unless player-customized.  
* **Detail Focus:** Featuring intricate equipment models (lights, pumps, HVAC), granular player customization options, and clear, detailed UI data visualizations. Initial plant visual complexity is a lower priority for the initial launch, relying on future AI procedural generation.  
* **Rewarding Feedback:** Providing clear, frequent visual and auditory acknowledgment of player actions, progress, and achievements. Feedback should be scalable from small tasks to major milestones. Intuitive visual upgrades are also important.  
* **Engaging Presentation:** Presenting complex simulation data (environment, genetics) in a clear, accessible manner, ensuring intuitive interaction. Visual complexity can ideally match the player's mood or desired vibe.

The style avoids being overly futuristic/sci-fi or heavily abstracted. Visual references include Satisfactory and Farming Simulator for equipment look, Stellaris and Cities: Skylines for UI data visualization, and Two Point Hospital/Campus for facility layout views.

**2\. Gameplay Mechanics**

**2.1. Core Gameplay Loop**

The core gameplay cycle is continuous and centers around **observation, learning via experimentation, and optimization**. Early game emphasizes significant manual interaction to build appreciation for later automation and advanced tools. The cycle involves detailed management and optimization, leading to tangible cultivation and facility improvements at a player-controlled pace.

The loop can be summarized as:

1. **Design & Build:** Constructing and optimizing cultivation spaces and infrastructure (electrical, plumbing, HVAC) within defined map/sandbox environments.  
2. **Cultivate:** Planting seeds/clones, managing the grow environment (temp, humidity, CO2, light, airflow, VPD), nurturing plants (training), managing nutrients and irrigation, and addressing pests/diseases.  
3. **Harvest & Process:** Harvesting mature plants and executing drying and curing processes to achieve desired end-product quality.  
4. **Analyze & Learn:** Collecting and interpreting data (environmental, plant health, yield, quality, genetic expressions) to inform future decisions.  
5. **Breed & Experiment (Optional but Key):** Selecting parent plants, making crosses, pheno-hunting, and utilizing advanced breeding techniques to develop new strains and stabilize traits.  
6. **Optimize & Expand:** Using acquired knowledge, resources, and improved genetics to enhance setups, techniques, efficiency, and scale operations.  
7. **Progress:** Unlocking new equipment, facility types, genetic potential, and advanced techniques via the progression system.

**2.2. Time Mechanic**

A flexible, player-controlled time system is fundamental. It balances realism and engagement, allowing accelerated active gameplay for observing rapid biological processes and offline progression for persistent cultivation.

**2.2.1. Active Gameplay Time Scales:** Players control the speed of in-game time relative to real-world time. Time acceleration impacts plant visual change rates, manual intervention frequency, environmental condition drift/response speed, and real-world observation duration. In-game timestamps are crucial for all logged data.

Defined active time scales include:

* **0.5x (Slowest):** 1 in-game day \= 5 real world minutes (approx. 12 game days per real hour).  
* **1x (Baseline):** 1 in-game week (6 in-game days) \= 1 real-world hour.  
* **"1 game day \= 2 real minutes":** (approx. 30 game days per real hour).  
* **"1 game day \= 1 real minute":** (approx. 60 game days per real hour).  
* **Fastest (e.g., 8x/12x):** For very advanced, stable facilities. This speed was initially noted as 1 game day \= 5 real minutes, and later adjusted to faster values. There is a discrepancy between the "Prompts" source and "Time Mechanic 1.1" regarding the fastest speed definition, but the principle of faster speeds for automated facilities stands.

**2.2.2. Consequences of Time Acceleration:**

* **Proportional Task Frequency:** Daily tasks become proportionally more frequent in real-world time at faster speeds.  
* **Consistent Resource Consumption:** Resources are consumed per in-game unit of time, depleting faster in real-world time at accelerated speeds.  
* **"Transition Inertia" System:** Changing speed involves a mandatory lock-in time at the new speed and a transition delay, preventing exploits. A pop-up warns of risks/benefits. The transition duration is a percentage of the real-world time for one in-game day at the *slower* speed, meaning larger jumps take longer. This makes speed changes strategic and committed.  
* **Subtle Time Scale-Dependent Variables:** Slower speeds *may* offer slightly higher maximum potential quality (e.g., 1-3% peak THC variance). Faster speeds *might* slightly increase the base probability/severity of minor stressors if not perfectly managed. Slower speeds could allow more nuanced positive interactions. This requires careful balancing.

**2.2.3. Offline Time Progression:** When saving/exiting, players choose the desired time scale for offline progression (from paused to any active speed). The game simulates missed events upon login. A **Catch-Up Visualization** shows an accelerated time-lapse of facility changes while computations run in the background, providing engaging visual feedback. A detailed **Facility Status Report** recap follows, showing resources, crop progress, events, harvests, and critical alerts. Offline safety is tied to the robustness of automated systems and resource buffers.

Game process durations (growth stages, drying, curing) map to real-world timeframes scaled by the chosen speed.

**2.3. Cultivation Systems**

This encompasses direct plant interactions and immediate environment management.

**2.3.1. Plant Lifecycle & Visuals:** The simulation includes a detailed plant lifecycle: planting seeds/clones, transplanting, growth stages (Seedling, Vegetative, Flowering), and harvest. Plant growth is dynamic and reflects the **Genotype x Environment (GxE) interaction**.

Plant visuals are a **central visual output**, reflecting the GxE simulation. They should be as realistic and biologically accurate as possible, striving for high fidelity within the engine. Visuals change and adapt over time based on simulation data (environment, grow factors, genetics). Visual indicators show health, growth stage, structure, color, deficiencies/excesses, pests, and pathogens. There is endless procedural subtle visual variation based on genetics, growing factors, and slight randomness. Color should be realistic and accurate, reflecting genetic expressions. Trichome density/appearance ("frostiness") is a key visual quality indicator.

Procedural generation algorithms (L-Systems, Parametric Modeling, Noise Functions) guided by GxE rules generate plant structure and morphology based on abstracted genetics data and environmental parameters. AI tools may assist in creating base textures (leaf surfaces, trichomes, pest/disease effects) and base mesh libraries for the procedural system.

Initial launch focuses on high-quality base models and core visual responses, with full dynamic, data-driven plant visualization evolving iteratively post-launch.

**2.3.2. Environmental Control:** This involves managing conditions like temperature, humidity, light cycles, light spectrum/intensity (PAR/PPFD), CO2 levels, and airflow. Players start with manual adjustment and basic automation (light timers, simple thermostat/humidistat).

Environmental conditions affect plant growth, health, and secondary metabolites. Optimal environmental parameters are often strain-specific "recipes" that adapt through the plant's lifecycle (Seedling/Clone, Vegetative, Flowering stages have different needs). These recipes are discovered via player experimentation and data analysis. Deviations from the optimal recipe cause graduated negative responses.

**2.3.3. Nutrient Management:** Players manage nutrient recipes, application, and medium EC/pH. Early game involves manual mixing and application, and monitoring medium EC/pH with handheld meters. Nutrient availability/deficiency/toxicity is a key environmental factor. Nutrient mixing in reservoirs is instantaneous and uniform post-addition and agitation. Growing medium properties (e.g., coco coir, perlite) influence saturation, retention, and drainage.

**2.3.4. Plant Health & IPM:** Basic plant health is indicated visually. A few common pests and diseases are modeled. Early game involves manual treatment (e.g., neem oil spray). Simulated air particle/spore traps could be a very advanced "Science" unlock. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies can be technique refinements unlocked via research.

**2.3.5. Plant Training & Care:** Basic plant training techniques like topping and manual LST (Low Stress Training) are included. Visual effects for techniques like topping (multiple colas), LST/ScrOG (horizontal canopy), and Lollipopping (stripped lower stem) are planned. Other potential manual tasks include pruning, watering checks, and checking soil moisture (visually, then with basic meters).

**2.3.6. Cleaning & Sanitation:** Maintaining a clean, organized facility is a design goal. Players can perform routine cleaning (dry/wet cleaning of grow areas), system flushing and cleaning (irrigation lines, tanks, HVAC), and deep cleaning/sanitization between cycles or after contamination. Methods vary by scale. This is crucial for facility aesthetics and potentially preventing issues.

**2.4. Data Collection & Analysis**

Transforming intricate simulation data into intuitive, actionable insights is a core philosophy. This empowers players to observe patterns, learn, and optimize. UI and Data Visualization are considered critical gameplay "assets".

**2.4.1. Data Points & Collection Methods:**

* **Environmental Data:** Real-time sensor readings for Temperature, Relative Humidity (RH), Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), CO2, and light intensity (PAR/PPFD at canopy if sensors placed). Sourced from player-placed sensors.  
* **Growing Medium Data:** Manual sampling using handheld meters for EC/PPM, pH, Temperature, and Volumetric Water Content (VWC%). Potential for continuously-logging soil/medium moisture probes (advanced sensor).  
* **Plant Data:** Visual inspection for health, growth stage, structure, and color. Manual sampling with tools like simulated Chlorophyll Content meters.  
* **Simulated Lab Analysis:** Potential for advanced analysis like tissue testing for nutrient levels or post-harvest cannabinoid/terpene profiles. This might be abstracted as sending samples off-site initially.  
* **Operational Data:** Tracking resource consumption (water, power), costs, task time, and yield results. Utility usage dashboard can show breakdown and cost calculations.  
* **Genetic Data:** Observed phenotypes, simulated lab analysis results (cannabinoid/terpene profiles), and potentially genetic marker analysis results.

**2.4.2. Data Presentation & UI:**

* **Environmental Data Dashboards/Overlays:** Real-time or summarized data for selected rooms/zones. Customizable.  
* **Graphs & Charts:** Visualizing historical trends for Environment, Nutrients, Growth, etc. Multi-variable plots are possible. Overlay historical trend graphs in tools like the Grow Cycle Comparator. Clear, aesthetically pleasing, and genuinely useful for decisions. Use clean lines, subtle gradients, logical colors.  
* **Simulated Lab Analysis Results:** Presented via "Lab Reports" showing values (NPK, THC/CBD %) and comparison to optimal/previous results. Uses charts, graphs, percentage lists.  
* **Breeding Interface:** Tools for parent selection, crossing, pheno-hunting, and comparing offspring traits. Genetics Lab Interface is the central hub for genetic/breeding activities, evolving with progression. Includes pedigree visualization and a Trait Library.  
* **Facility Management Overlays:** Utility View showing pipe/duct/wire networks with flow/pressure indicators. Zoning UI. Resource inventory/consumption.  
* **Operational & Financial Data:** Budget, Costs (Utilities, Consumables), Revenue, Profit/Loss.  
* **Alerts & Notifications:** Visual/audio cues for critical issues (environment out-of-range, pest, root rot). Tiered by severity (Blue/Informational, Yellow/Warning, Red/Critical). Logged with timestamps. Actionable information directs to relevant UI/location. Customization of preferences is possible.  
* **Historical Logs & Notes:** A central, searchable, filterable logbook for automated events (planting, harvest, alerts, research completion) with in-game timestamps, and player-input notes (Grower's Journal) assigned to plants, rooms, etc., with tagging.  
* **Tutorial/Info Overlays:** Explaining concepts (VPD, GxE, deficiencies) linking symptoms to causes/solutions from guides like the "Plant Problems Guide".

**2.4.3. Analysis Tools:**

* **Sensor & Controller Management Interface:** Centralized UI to view/manage sensors (placement, naming, status, calibration) and link them to controllers for defining logic (IF-THEN).  
* **Grow Cycle Comparator Tool:** Side-by-side analysis of multiple grow cycles for learning and optimization, comparing KPIs like Yield, Quality, Costs, Duration, Health problems, and overlaying historical graphs.  
* **Simulated "Lab Analysis" Interface:** Manages submitting samples, processing time, costs, and viewing Lab Reports.  
* **Advanced Analytics Software:** Late-game tool integrating with sensor networks for facility-level analysis, A/B test comparisons, and basic statistics. Requires Science skill progression.

**2.5. Genetics & Breeding**

This is a core pillar focused on genetic inheritance, expression, and manipulation. The aim is a sophisticated, intuitive platform for discovery, experimentation, stabilization, and innovation.

**2.5.1. Deep Genetics Simulation:** The heart of the system is a robust simulation of genetic inheritance and expression. Key quantitative traits (yield, potency) are polygenic. The simulation incorporates rules and probabilities potentially derived from offline AI analysis of biological data. Players may unlock an in-game **"AI Research Lab"** feature that uses simplified algorithms to simulate potential breeding outcomes and provides probabilistic outputs (likelihood of traits, range of expression, parental suggestions, warnings about negative traits/inbreeding). This tool has a significant in-game cost (currency, rare resources, computation time). The AI Lab offers suggestions, not guaranteed results; the player makes all final decisions and conducts pheno-hunts, dealing with inherent randomness.

Initial launch will have a **limited set of foundational strains (5-10 landrace-inspired)** but with full genetic complexity for vast player-bred variations. Future "drops" will introduce new base genetics.

**2.5.2. Trait Library:** A dynamic, player-populated database of all known in-game genetic traits (discovered/acquired). Population methods include acquisition (landraces, unique cultivars), breeding (discovering novel expressions via pheno-hunting), and research (unlocking understanding of new traits/interactions). The library catalogs traits such as Cannabinoid Profiles (THC, CBD, CBG, etc.), Terpene Profiles, Yield Factors, Flowering Time, Morphology (Height, Branching), Environmental Tolerances (Heat, Cold, Drought), Pest/Disease Resistance, Nutrient Uptake Efficiency, and potentially visual traits (Color Potential, Bud Density, Trichome Density).

**2.5.3. Breeding Mechanics:**

* **Core Process:** Select male/female parents, cross-pollinate, harvest seeds, grow the F1 generation.  
* **Pheno-Hunting:** Grow offspring, evaluate phenotypes (visually, data-driven), select the best individuals based on desired trait combinations. Elite individuals can be cloned, used as parents, or stabilized. Genetic Marker Analysis (late-game) can assist by providing probabilistic markers for desired traits in young seedlings, allowing earlier culling.  
* **Advanced Techniques:** Backcrossing (BX), Inbreeding (IBL), Selfing (S1), Feminization are planned. Backcrossing involves multi-generational pedigree tracking.  
* **Genetic Stability vs. Variability:** A strategic tension exists between developing stable, uniform strains (via inbreeding) and seeking diversity/hybrid vigor (via outcrossing). Inbreeding depression is modeled.  
* **Landrace Strains:** Role as foundational genetic stock, often rare/difficult to acquire. They possess unique genetic potential (rare alleles for cannabinoids, terpenes, resistance) and are reservoirs of genetic diversity for creating elite, novel hybrids.

**2.5.4. Rare Genetic Acquisition (Post-AR Removal):** The initial concept of using AR "search/find" for rare genetics like landraces was re-evaluated and deferred indefinitely due to complexity, cost, and questionable benefit vs. risk. Instead, robust, immersive in-game mechanics are planned. Alternative methods include:

* **NPC-Sponsored Expeditions/Research Grants:** Abstracted resource/time investment with a chance for rare seeds, potentially depending on research/equipment levels.  
* **High-Tier NPC Contacts & Faction Reputation:** High reputation with specific NPCs (remote collectives, universities, seed banks) unlocks exclusive heirloom/landrace genetics.  
* **Lore-Driven Discovery & "Lost Strain" Quests:** Clues found in lore items (journals, records, dialogue, company archives) lead to multi-stage "rediscovery" processes.  
* **Specialist NPC Vendors/Collectors:** Rare genetics acquired via unique, high-priced NPCs or challenging contract rewards.

Each acquired landrace will ideally include a detailed "Acquisition Report" or "Origin Dossier" providing narrative context (native environment, traditional uses, discovery/preservation story), hinting at diverse off-screen regions.

**2.5.5. Tissue Culture & Micropropagation:** An advanced technique for rapid multiplication and genetic preservation.

* **Mechanics:** Requires a dedicated sterile lab (high-tier Construction asset, potentially linked to Specialized Facility Development). Consumes resources (sterile agar, plant hormones, culture vessels). A meticulous, multi-stage in-game process (explant prep, multiplication, rooting) could be a mini-game or timed process with success/failure rates.  
* **Benefits:** Rapid cloning from small sources, faster than traditional methods. Genetic preservation in vitro long-term. Potential for abstracted genetic cleaning (reducing some systemic issues).  
* **Progression:** Unlocked via the Science skill tree ("Advanced Propagation") and potentially linked to understanding sterile techniques.

**2.6. Processing & Post-Harvest**

This multi-stage system transforms harvested cannabis into marketable products, realizing the cultivated genetic potential. Success in post-harvest is as vital as cultivation for achieving top-tier results and maximizing returns.

**2.6.1. Drying:** Manual hanging/racking in a designated dry space. The environment (temp, humidity, airflow) significantly impacts time and quality. Optimal conditions are crucial for terpene retention and preventing mold. Automation involves climate-controlled drying rooms.

**2.6.2. Curing:** Manual container curing (jars) with manual "burping" (venting). Curing develops smoothness, complexity, aroma, and flavor. Requires stable humidity (ideally 58-62%). Longer cures can increase complexity but risk over-drying if mismanaged. Strain-specific curing needs may be modeled and discoverable. Automation can include "Smart" curing containers with integrated RH sensors and automated micro-venting, or climate-controlled rooms.

**2.6.3. Trimming:** Manual hand-trimming. Impacts bag appeal (appearance) and efficiency. Automation can include trimming machines (wet or dry), which are faster but can reduce quality/trichome retention if not managed. Requires managing speed, load, maintenance, and potentially strain types for optimal results.

**2.6.4. Advanced Extraction Techniques (Post-MVP):** Creating concentrates (oils, shatter, wax, isolates) is a major post-harvest expansion planned for post-MVP or late-game.

* **Equipment:** Includes Solventless methods (Rosin presses) and Solvent-Based methods (Extraction Vessels, Winterization Equipment like lab freezers and filtration, Solvent Recovery/Purging equipment, Distillation equipment). Solvent-based mechanics would be abstracted.  
* **Process:** Involves washing material with a solvent (e.g., ethanol, CO2), winterization to remove fats/waxes, solvent recovery/purging, potentially distillation for purity, and post-processing (whipping, agitating) for desired consistency.  
* **Quality Factors:** Each step influences concentrate yield, purity, potency, flavor (terpene retention), and consistency.  
* **Progression:** Requires a dedicated "Extraction Science" or "Advanced Processing" skill branch (potentially under the Science tree), significant investment in specialized lab equipment, dedicated facility space with safety features (e.g., solvent ventilation), and advanced knowledge.

**2.6.5. Edibles & Topicals (Post-MVP):** Formulating products infused with cannabinoids/terpenes is planned post-MVP.

* **Process:** Involves recipes with ingredients, cannabis input type (flower, extract), infusion methods, cooking/mixing parameters, and target dosage.  
* **Quality Control:** Dosage consistency is critical gameplay; requires precise measurements and potential simulated batch testing. Inaccurate dosing can lead to in-game reputation penalties or product recalls.  
* **Equipment:** Includes mixing/cooking equipment, filling machines, and packaging lines for individual units or topicals.

**2.6.6. Quality Degradation & Perishability:** Harvested product has a shelf-life. Degradation over time is modeled.

* **Feedback:** Visual cues (mold, color changes, reduced trichome vibrancy) and simulated lab tests showing cannabinoid/terpene decrease or profile shifts indicate degradation.  
* **Market Impact:** Degraded products sell for significantly lower prices, and NPCs provide specific negative feedback ("stale," "potency lower"). Proper storage (climate-controlled, airtight containers) is needed.

**2.7. Construction & Facility Management**

Players design, build, and modify cultivation facilities within predefined sandbox environments.

**2.7.1. Sandbox Environments ("Maps"):** The game features pre-made levels or maps, identical for all players to ensure a consistent starting point for customization. These facilities are in an "endless white abyss" or "purgatory," limiting traditional external environmental storytelling. Focus is on the player-controlled interior spaces.

* **Initial Map:** The **Residential House Interior**. A small, underutilized space with a predefined layout. Its initial state (wear/tear, non-interactive relics) subtly tells the story of humble beginnings. Players manage operations within rooms.  
* **Second Map (Warehouse):** Unlocked after exhausting the Residential House map and/or completing initial objectives/milestones. A giant open warehouse shell in the white abyss (roof, concrete floor, metal supports initially). Requires building from the ground up: walls, rooms, placing large-scale equipment.  
* **Future Maps:** Potential expansions may add thematically distinct facilities like a reclaimed "Abandoned Research Outpost," "Geothermal Greenhouse Complex", outdoor setups, advanced subterranean labs, or themed expansions. Their initial state and unique challenges offer environmental storytelling.

**2.7.2. Structural Elements:** Players place structural elements (walls, floors, roofs) in X, Y, Z axes within map boundaries. Construction is primarily **grid-based**, with a fundamental unit of one (1) foot. A "Snap to Grid" toggle is available, snapping to lines, intersections, mid-points, and relevant points on existing objects. Advanced stages may add freeform tools for walls/structures. The height/thickness of elements is determined by the selected asset type (e.g., "8ft Drywall Section" vs. "10ft Insulated Panel"). These assets may require research or purchase. Material selection impacts cost, appearance, functional properties (insulation, light reflectivity), durability, and cleanliness. Walls can function as plant surfaces or equipment mounts.

**2.7.3. Zoning:** Players can designate areas (Veg, Flower, Dry, Moms, Clones, Cure). Strategic placement impacts efficiency, environmental control, and risk.

**2.7.4. Equipment & Furniture Placement:** Essential cultivation equipment (basic lights, fans, pots/containers, basic irrigation) is placed. Placement can be free or grid-snapped, with collision detection. Objects have multi-axis rotation. Workflow tools like "Copy and Paste" aid efficient layouts. Unlockable Decorative Items acquired/crafted can add the "Cozy" feel to early game spaces, while larger spaces support the "Professional" aesthetic.

**2.7.5. Utility System Construction:** Detailed and interconnected utility networks (Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC) are a key feature, especially in the Warehouse map onwards. Construction involves 3D routing of pipes, ducts, and wires, with snapping or free routing, considering collisions. Sizing (diameters/gauges) impacts performance (flow, capacity, pressure/voltage drop). Material impacts cost, durability, efficiency, and appearance. Logical source-to-endpoint connections provide visual feedback.

A **Utility View Toggle ("X-Ray" or "Engineering View")** is crucial for construction and management, especially in complex environments like the Warehouse. It is not available in the initial Residential House map. Unlocked with Warehouse access, potentially tied to progression. When toggled, structural elements become "ghostly translucent" to reveal hidden utility networks behind/within walls, floors, and roofs. Utility component models are high-detail. Simple, non-simulated flow animations (moving pulses, color changes) provide connectivity/function feedback.

Abstracted physics models are used for performance (e.g., zone-based HVAC influence, simplified irrigation flow logic) rather than full fluid dynamics or CFD. Performance is managed by recalculating environmental parameters periodically (e.g., every few in-game minutes, adjusting with time acceleration) rather than per frame.

**2.7.6. Buffers, Redundancy, and Risk Management:** These systems are paramount as operations scale and with time acceleration. Minor issues can escalate.

* **Backup Power Systems:** Generators (diesel/gas, require fuel, auto-activate on grid failure, limited capacity) and Battery Banks/UPS (short-term buffer for critical systems) can be implemented. Tiers of generators exist (basic to advanced).  
* **Redundant Water Pumps:** Players can design plumbing redundancy; a "Dual Pump Manifold" could be a higher-tier researchable equipment.  
* **Automated Control Systems:** Linking sensors to controllers allows systems to react to conditions (IF-THEN logic). Automation is key to managing complexity at scale.

**2.8. Economy & Resource Management**

The game features an economic layer evolving with player capabilities.

**2.8.1. Initial NPC Buyer/Contract Economy (MVP Focus):** The MVP uses an **NPC economy only**. Income is generated from selling harvested product to NPC buyers via contracts. Players receive NPC-issued cultivation contracts specifying strain, quantity, and quality. Basic operational cost management is included (utilities, consumables like nutrients/medium/seeds, initial equipment).

**2.8.2. Future Player-Driven Marketplace (Post-MVP):** A core feature, planned for a future expansion. It will be an extensive, active in-game marketplace for trading useful/rare items.

* **Tradable Items:** All game attributes, not just plants. Expected largest segments: plant genetics (seeds, cuttings), growing equipment.  
* **Core Economic Principles:** Built on robust principles like Supply & Demand. Game systems allow these to operate naturally. High availability/low demand decreases price, scarcity/high demand increases it.  
* **Order Management:** Players will have a dashboard to track buy/sell orders, view history, manage a marketplace wallet, and claim proceeds.  
* **Market Data:** Potentially an advanced feature unlocking access to historical price charts, average sale prices, and trading volume to help informed decisions. Could be unlocked via a "Business" skill tree node or in-game service subscription.  
* **Market Scope:** A Global Market (unified for all players) is recommended initially for simplicity and liquidity. Regional Markets (involving transport costs/risks, local supply/demand/regulations) are a potential future expansion due to significant complexity.  
* **Reputation:** User/company reputation (game-wide/marketplace) affects NPC interactions (prices, contracts) and P2P trading (trust, value). It is tied to crop quality; high quality increases rep/prices, low quality damages it. Selling bad genetics (seeds/clones) severely damages rep. Players should verify reputation before trading.

**2.8.3. Robust Resource/Currency Sinks:** Crucial for preventing runaway inflation and maintaining currency value.

* **Marketplace Tax & Listing Fees:** Small percentage tax on final sales and a small flat listing fee (discourages spam) are primary, consistent sinks in the future player market.  
* **NPC Vendors:** NPCs sell essentials, rare genetic starting material, unique equipment blueprints, and specialized services (e.g., advanced lab analysis for a high fee) at fixed, significant prices, removing currency from circulation.  
* **Operational Costs:** Utilities, consumables, equipment purchase/repair, facility upgrades, research funding are ongoing sinks.

**2.8.4. Resource Management:** Players track quantities of consumables (nutrients, growing medium, water, generator fuel). Resource depletion rates in real-time are tied to the active time scale, making reserve management more critical at faster speeds. Exploring processing/re-using waste for beneficial byproducts (composting) or revenue is a future vision.

**2.9. Player Progression**

Progression is a **structural framework** guided by narrative milestones. It drives the player journey, unlocks new capabilities, and adds purpose. Progression is designed to be natural, starting simple and transitioning to complex systems. It needs to be complete, cohesive, rewarding, challenging, and entertaining for the initial launch.

**2.9.1. Primary Driver: Skill Tree ("The Tree"):** A character-centric progression system visualized as a Cannabis plant. It has primary "Leaves" (categories) of varying size/prominence. Leaves unfurl to show "Nodes" (skills/concepts); the plant visually grows and increases vibrancy with progression.

* **Skill Point Acquisition:** Main source is completing objectives/tasks/challenges. Secondary source is successful harvests (quality/outcome-based reward). More ways are TBD.  
* **Node Unlocking Philosophy:** Unlocking a node introduces a **core concept and associated game mechanics/simulations**. Mastery and efficiency of the concept are gained via separate equipment/tool progression (purchased, researched, crafted). Unlocking a concept (e.g., Temperature) introduces its simulation; the player's ability to manage it depends on other unlocks (e.g., thermometers).  
* **Leaves/Categories (Illustrative Node Counts):**  
  * **Cultivation (Target: \~8-12 Nodes):** Broad techniques, nutrient, pest/disease, env control fundamentals.  
  * **Environment (Target: \~6-8 Nodes):** Env control systems (lights, HVAC, CO2), sensors, basic automation.  
  * **Construction (Target: \~6-8 Nodes):** Room structuring, utilities, facility types, basic automation.  
  * **Genetics (Target: \~8-12 Nodes):** Breeding concepts, techniques, deeper genetic understanding. Includes Seed/Clone fundamentals, Mother Plants, basic propagation.  
  * **Harvest (Target: \~4-6 Nodes):** Readiness, techniques, controlled drying, trimming/prep, curing, post-harvest efficiency.  
  * **Science (Target: \~4-6 Nodes):** Data collection/analysis, research. Includes Observation/Record Keeping, Manual Sampling (meters, microscope), Data Interpretation/Diagnostics, Quantitative Analysis (Basic Lab Testing), Advanced Analytics & Research Methodology.  
  * **Business (Target: \~3-4 Nodes):** Basic Ops Mngmt, Brand/Rep, Market Awareness. Includes potentially Advanced Economic Ops for the Player Marketplace.  
* **Interdependencies:** Logical prerequisites exist between nodes in different categories, encouraging broader development. UI contextually shows dependencies (highlights, tooltips). Cross-category advancements nodes might be at "Leaf" edges.  
* **"Ability vs. Challenge" Dynamic:** Unlocked nodes grant abilities but also introduce new complexities/management considerations, ensuring balanced difficulty.

**2.9.2. Research System:** A dedicated Research system adds a layer of discovery, specialized unlocks, and resource management beyond the Skill Tree. It's deeply integrated; Research Points could fund Skill Tree unlocks, or Research Projects become available after unlocking certain nodes.

* **Interface:** Dedicated UI for available projects showing costs, prerequisites, time (if applicable), and rewards.  
* **Unlocks:** Research unlocks provide tangible benefits beyond direct Skill Tree nodes: Equipment Blueprints (advanced gear not on skill tree), Technique Refinements (improved processes like TC success, pollen storage, IPM), Genetic Insights (deeper trait understanding, rare gene info, better AI Lab algorithms), Material Synthesis (crafting rare consumables), Facility Upgrades (unique lab/specialized room upgrades), and potentially narrative elements (in-game history/science). Unlocks should open new gameplay avenues, enhance systems, or provide solutions to challenges.  
* **Sources of Progress:** Research Points/Funding/Progress comes from Objective Completion (Research/Scientific Contracts), Data Analysis & Submission (analyzing high-quality harvests), Breeding Breakthroughs (creating stable, novel strains), Active Experimentation (running tests), and In-Game Currency (funding applied research).

**2.9.3. Narrative Milestones:** Narrative serves as a **structural framework** for player progression. Milestones guide players through key development stages and unlock new capabilities. Examples span Early Game (Establish First Grow, Successful Harvest/Sale, Master Basic Nutrients), Mid Game (Secure Funding, Develop Strain for Research, Master Grower Cert, Warehouse Permit), and Late Game (Pioneer Genetic Line, Market Leader, Renowned Genetic Library, Cannabis Innovator Award). Narrative milestones can unlock Skill Tree sections/tiers, Research Projects, access to new facility types/maps (Residential to Warehouse), introduce new NPC contacts/factions/market opportunities, provide one-time rewards (currency, rare genetics, equipment blueprints, reputation), and shift available contracts/research focus.

**2.9.4. Equipment & Resource-Based Progression:** Distinct from the Skill Tree, players upgrade equipment (lights, pumps) and improve resource quality (water, air, electricity, genetics) via currency and research. Unlocked skill nodes make equipment/resources available or manageable. Equipment can have its own upgrade paths (e.g., pump parts).

**2.9.5. Meta-Progression:** Persistent elements that carry over across game saves:

* **Persistent Genetic Library:** Player-bred strains tied to the player account, usable in new games.  
* **Starting Facility Choice:** Ability to start new games in advanced facilities (e.g., Warehouse) after completing the initial level once.  
* **Persistent Reputation:** User/company reputation affecting NPC interactions and (future) marketplace trading.

**2.9.6. Other Progression Types:**

* **Skill and Mastery-Based:** Natural player improvement through practice, understanding, experimentation. Potentially reflected in online leaderboards.  
* **Time-Based and Engagement:** Daily/weekly challenges/rewards, seasonal content/cosmetic drops tied to real-world time.  
* **Player Agency and Choice-Driven:** The core sandbox philosophy allows diverse paths and solutions.

**2.10. Automation Systems**

Automation in Project Chimera follows an **"Earned Automation" philosophy**. Players progressively gain tools and systems to alleviate the "Burden of Consistency" – the challenges of maintaining optimal conditions manually at scale or accelerated time. Automation is a desirable, empowering path to greater efficiency, scale, and achieving peak genetic potential. It is not intended as punishment for manual tasks.

Automation is enabled by:

* **Sensors:** Provide raw data for decisions and automated control. Tiers include Basic (standalone, manual checking), Intermediate (networked to central display or simple controllers), and Advanced (highly accurate, multi-functional, potentially specialized like leaf surface temp, moisture probes, inline water sensors, spore traps). Sensors provide real-time/logged data for player understanding and automated controller operation.  
* **Controllers:** Equipment that reacts to sensor data using defined logic (IF-THEN). Examples include automated HVAC systems maintaining temperature/humidity based on sensor input, or automated irrigation systems based on soil moisture data.  
* **Workflow Management (Late-Game):** The zenith of earned automation, managing larger/complex facilities by automating repetitive, labor-intensive tasks. This is typically very late-game.

Automation helps free the player from repetitive tasks for strategic activities (genetics, research, design, market). The player agency is in identifying their most demanding tasks ("Pain Points") and prioritizing automation unlocks based on their perceived needs.

**2.11. Environmental Storytelling**

Due to the primary facilities being in an "endless white abyss," traditional external environmental storytelling is limited. The focus is on **environmental storytelling within the constraints**, using player-controlled spaces and abstracted interactions.

Methods include:

* **Initial Player Spaces:** The Residential House's initial state (wear/tear, non-interactive "relics" of prior life) subtly tells the story of the player's humble beginnings.  
* **Unlockable Decorative Items:** Some acquired/crafted items have lore (e.g., "Pioneer's Cultivation Manual" display, photo of a legendary breeder, vintage lab equipment).  
* **Landrace Strain Acquisition:** The narrative framing of landrace acquisition (Research Expeditions, Faction Reputation, Lore Discovery leading to "Origin Dossiers") paints a picture of diverse, off-screen regions and history.  
* **Future Facility Types:** Potential expansions (e.g., Abandoned Research Outpost) can offer environmental storytelling through their initial state, unique hazards, and remnants of previous operations.  
* **Ambient Environmental Cues (Subtle):** Optional UI elements like a Radio/News Ticker with headlines (industry, science, world events) provide a sense of a living world. Branding on equipment hints at a larger industrial ecosystem.

**2.12. Subtle World-Building & Lore Delivery**

The world is fleshed out via **non-intrusive, diegetic methods**, allowing organic lore discovery.

Delivery methods include:

* **In-Game Communications (Email/Messaging):** Player inbox receives Industry News Digests (market trends, competitors, tech), Scientific Journal Excerpts (abstracts of fictional science breakthroughs), Messages from NPC Contacts (contracts, opportunities, collaborations), and Internal Memos from ADA (system updates, reviews).  
* **Item Descriptions:** Equipment, seeds, nutrients, decor have concise descriptions with lore (fictional manufacturer background, tech history, landrace origin story/cultural context).  
* **Research & Skill Tree Unlocks:** New tech, breeding techniques, or scientific concepts come with a brief text blurb on their history, discovery, or in-world significance.  
* **Ambient Environmental Cues:** As mentioned above (News Ticker, Branding).

Content of Lore examples:

* **State of Cannabis Industry:** Post-legalization landscape, mega-corps vs. startups, prevailing regulations.  
* **Scientific & Technological Landscape:** General tech level, renowned fictional research institutions/geneticists.  
* **Cultural Context:** In-world views on cannabis use (medicinal, recreational, industrial, specialized).  
* **Historical Milestones:** Past events shaping the current landscape (blight leading to resistant strains, "Great Legalization Accord," key genetic marker discovery).

**3\. Visual Style & User Interface (UI/UX)**

The UI/UX design is a **critical gameplay asset**. It aims to be **modern, clean, sophisticated, visually stunning, intuitive, and highly functional**. The goal is to effectively present complex data without overwhelming the player. It aligns with a "dark mode" palette.

**3.1. Aesthetics:**

* **Overall Goal:** Present complex simulation data accessibly, intuitively, and meaningfully. Transform intricate data into actionable insights.  
* **Panel & Button Style:** Material Design-inspired (subtle depth, layering, soft shadows) for hierarchy and interactivity; a clean look overall.  
* **Iconography:** Abstract but recognizable symbols; sophisticated line art. Simple, clear, and instantly understandable. Uses vibrant Accent Palette colors for standout elements or categorization.  
* **Data Visualization:** **CRITICAL FEATURE**. Displays (graphs, charts, readouts) must be exceptionally clear, easy to interpret, aesthetically pleasing, and genuinely useful. Uses clean lines, subtle gradients, logical Accent/Functional colors. Visual representations (icons, graphs, progress bars) are prioritized over text.  
* **Interactivity & Feedback:** Subtle, smooth animations and transitions for UI interactions (hovers, clicks, panels) to feel live and responsive. Animations should be quick and never interrupt gameplay flow or cause noticeable delays.  
* **Layout & Information Density:** Prioritizes clean, uncluttered layouts with effective negative space. Balances complex info with clarity using flexible tabs, collapsible sections, contextual tooltips, and modal windows. Avoids screen clutter.  
* **Typography:** Clean, modern, highly readable system complementing the sophisticated UI and data. Uses precise, professional fonts aligning with high-tech/scientific themes. Font weights vary for hierarchy (Headers/Titles heavier, Body standard, UI Elements medium, Data Displays clarity paramount).

**3.2. View Hierarchy & Interaction:** Navigation is hierarchical, allowing zoom from strategic facility views to tactical room views and detailed plant views.

* **Level 1:** Exterior Shell (minimalist, white abyss).  
* **Level 2:** Blueprint View (strategic, adapter from Two Point Hospital/Cities: Skylines). Shows facility layout.  
* **Level 3:** Room Interior View (1st/Close 3rd Person, "street view" like Google Earth). Allows scanning area.  
* **Level 4+:** Detail Views (Bench, Hydroponic System, Individual Plant). Increasing visual/data granularity. Clicking on a plant or asset in "street view" brings up a detailed UI panel or enters "Action Mode".

**3.3. Data Display Details:**

* **Plant Detail UI:** Evolves with progression. Early game shows basic info (Strain Name, Age, Health Status Bar 1-10 scale). Blank data fields hint at unlocks via tooltips. Includes a Player Visual Observation Log. Mid-Late game populates with manual data entries (with timestamps) and real-time sensor data. Tabs (Environment, Nutrition, Genetics, Health Log) organize dense data.  
* **Manual Data Acquisition UI:** When a tool is selected (e.g., meter), the player targets an asset (plant, pot, reservoir). Entering "Action Mode" provides a tool-specific view (e.g., pH meter probe in substrate with animating display, ambient thermometer reading local temp). Data is auto-logged with an in-game timestamp.  
* **Time Display UI:** Clear communication of the time mechanic is crucial. A persistent display shows current in-game date/time and active time acceleration level. Contextual time info shows projected real-world time for processes (e.g., growth stage duration) based on current speed. Clickable time/date strings toggle between game time and real-world time display, clearly indicated. Historical logs use in-game timestamps primarily.

**3.4. UI/UX Refinement:** UI layout and information density will be refined via iterative design and testing. Key strategies include flexible tab systems, collapsible sections, contextual tooltips and popovers, modal windows, and a "drill-down" architecture from high-level to granular info. Prototyping and usability testing with players throughout development is essential. Full UI modding is likely out of scope, but limited customization like dashboard widgets or filter presets might be possible.

**3.5. Rendering Style & Quality:** Goal is visually sophisticated, high-quality rendering. Slightly stylized but grounded. Detail and clean visuals emphasized, not necessarily photorealistic.

* **LOD & Textures:** Relatively high geometric detail and texture resolution for core assets. Fine equipment details should be visible. LODs are mandatory and aggressive, especially for plants and frequent assets. Typically 3-4 LOD levels per asset.  
* **Material Definition:** High contrast, realistic interactions. Perceived realism in material relationships is important. PBR (Physically Based Rendering) is used, especially with AI tools assisting texture creation.  
* **Lighting:** Primarily soft/ambient, with contextual harsher/functional lighting.  
* **Post-Processing/VFX:** Elegant and appropriate use of effects like Ambient Occlusion, Bloom, subtle Depth of Field. Not overused. Matches overall graphical sophistication.  
* **Anti-Aliasing:** Good quality AA is needed for smooth, clean edges, supporting the "clean" aesthetic.  
* **Performance Strategy:** Initial launch prioritizes visual quality/detail within a constrained scope (e.g., limited max facility size). Ongoing optimization and performance scaling for larger player creations are planned post-launch. Polygon budgets TBD via performance testing to balance detail and smooth performance.

**3.6. Environment Design:** Core concept is internal focus. Progression moves from small predefined spaces (house rooms) to large customizable sandboxes (warehouses). Minimalist exterior ("endless white abyss/purgatory").

**3.7. Plant Visualization:** **Core Goal:** Highest possible visual realism and biological accuracy for cannabis plants. They are the **primary visual output** of the GxE simulation and "the thing" in the game.

* **Detail:** Plants should be extremely detailed (leaves, buds, trichomes, stems, medium, pests, pathogens, deficiencies/excesses) without jarring contrast with other assets. Trichome density/appearance is a key visual \[, oranges, yellows).  
* **Dynamics:** Visuals change and adapt over time based on simulation data (environment, grow factors, genetics). They start basic and advance with the simulation. Balance consistency with procedural variation.

**4\. Technical Considerations**

**4.1. Game Engine:** **Unreal Engine** is the chosen engine, noted for its high-fidelity rendering, robust toolset, and community support. All maps/levels are intended to be in one engine, reusing physics/algorithms.

**4.2. Core Simulation & Physics Models:** Abstracted real-world physics are used for performance rather than hyper-realistic simulations.

* **HVAC/Airflow:** Zone-based influence model, not full CFD. Calculations are periodic (e.g., every few in-game minutes) and adjust with time acceleration. Construction material properties (insulation) affect heat transfer.  
* **Irrigation/Fluid Dynamics:** No detailed pipe fluid physics. Focus on logical flow and resource distribution. Pump flow rates are based on specs with abstracted pressure loss. Pipe diameter can bottleneck. Nutrient mixing is instantaneous post-agitation. Medium properties (water retention, drainage) are modeled via a simplified percolation model.  
* **Genetics Engine:** Opposite to physics; limited set of foundational strains initially but with near full genetic complexity from the start. Uses rules/probabilities, allows vast player-bred variety. Needs balance.

**4.3. AI Tool Integration (Development Process):** AI tools are utilized as **assistive technology** within a **hybrid human-AI workflow**. Humans direct, refine, and optimize.

* **Mandatory Manual Optimization:** ALL AI-generated 3D assets must undergo manual review and optimization by a human artist. Raw AI 3D output is **NOT game-ready**. Steps include Retopology, UV Unwrapping/Correction, LOD Creation, and Texture Baking/Refinement. This ensures assets meet performance targets, technical requirements, and art style.  
* **Tool Usage:**  
  * **2D Assets (Concepts):** Primary: Gemini Imagen. Secondary: Leonardo.Ai, Layer-ready exports. Meshy was decent but had errors and cost concerns; Sloyd performed worst.  
  * **3D Assets (Cannabis Plants \- Special Case):** Requires a **custom AI-Assisted Procedural Generation system driven by game data**. Rodin provides PBR textures and potentially base meshes for this system. AI assists procedural texturing and base mesh libraries.  
  * **AI Coding Assistant:** Cursor with TaskMaster MCP is the primary tool for code generation, compilation, organization, testing, debugging.  
* **Workflow Strategy:** Balanced AI Integration (Hybrid Workflow). Engine integration is primarily direct asset import after manual optimization. Rigorous asset management (naming, folders, version control via Git LFS) and provenance tracking are crucial.  
* **Provenance Tracking:** Mandatory for AI-assisted assets. Metadata includes AI tool/version, exact prompts, seed numbers, date, human artist names, summary of human modifications, and licensing info. Stored in spreadsheets or databases. Ensures legal/ethical compliance, aids QC, allows reproducibility, helps debug artifacts.  
* **Prompting Consistency:** Develop a "Prompting Guide"/library aligned with the art style.  
* **Human Review Checkpoints:** Mandatory stages where leads sign off on assets for visual, technical, and performance compliance.  
* **Emerging Technologies:** NeRF and Gaussian Splatting are monitored but not incorporated for launch due to current limitations.

**4.4. Engine-Native Systems:** Leveraging engine capabilities for animation systems.

* **Shaders & Materials:** Maximizing engine's material editor for dynamic effects (growth visualizers, health/stress states, GxE responses, utility flow, material aging/wear).  
* **Particle Systems:** For effects like water/nutrient drips, CO2 haze, smoke/vapor.  
* **UI Animation:** Using the engine's UI framework for responsive/engaging UI elements.

**4.5. Asset Management & Style Consistency:** Crucial for a large project. Strict naming conventions, standardized folder structure, and version control (Git LFS) are implemented. Provenance tracking for AI assets is key. Consistent prompting and rigorous review against the Visual Style Guide are essential.

**4.6. Game Analytics & Technology Monitoring:** Analytics tools will be set up (during Beta/Post-Launch) to collect anonymized, aggregated data on player progression, economic trends, gameplay behavior, and system performance. This data informs balancing and future development. Technology monitoring is strategic, focusing on maturity, workflow impact, cost, licensing, performance, and alignment with game vision before adopting new tech.

**5\. Risk Mitigation**

Proactively identifying and mitigating risks is key for smooth development and a successful launch.

* **Complexity:** Balancing deep, realistic systems with engagement and understandability. Strategies include Progressive Disclosure (gradual system intro), Clear UI/UX, AI Advisor Guidance, Integrated Tutorials  
  * **Procedural Plant Generation Quality/Performance:** Risk of visually diverse, high-quality plants reflecting GxE being performant with many instances. Mitigation includes a Modular and Artist-Controlled Procedural System (human artists create base assets/rules, AI assists variety), Strict Performance Budgets (poly counts, draw calls, textures), and Extensive Visual/Performance Testing.  
  * **AI-Assisted Asset Pipeline Integrity/Legal Compliance:** Risk of immature tools, inconsistent style, legal/ethical issues, inefficient PBR integration. Mitigation includes Mandatory Human Artist Optimization/Oversight, Rigorous Provenance Tracking, Strategic/Selective AI tool use, Strict Visual Style Guide adherence (human review), and staying informed on Evolving Legal/Ethical Landscape.  
* **Scope Management:** Rigorous feature prioritization for a focused, achievable MVP. Deferring advanced systems (breeding, marketplace, automation, extraction, physics, multi-region world, deep narrative) to later phases. Phased development plan (Phase 0: Pre-Production/Prototyping, Phase 1: Vertical Slice, Phase 2: MVP Development in Sprints, Phase 3: Alpha/Beta Testing, Phase 4: MVP Launch, Phase 5: Post-MVP Expansions/Live Service). Re-evaluating and removing high-risk/low-benefit features like AR.

**6\. Securing Realism Data & Knowledge Base**

Accurate, verifiable info is crucial for authenticity and aligning with the "Realism Bias" philosophy.

* **Process:** Sourcing from Public-Domain Knowledge (peer-reviewed papers, university pubs, horticultural texts, guides) \[2 is subject to ongoing review/refinement (testing, feedback, new science). Key validated info conveyed via in-game guides ("Plant Problems Guide") and ADA.

**7\. Monetization**

Proposed model is a **Hybrid Model: Buy-to-Play (B2P) base game \+ Ethical Microtransactions**.

* **Base Game:** One-time purchase provides the complete core experience.  
* **Microtransactions (Ethical & Non-P2W):** Purely Cosmetics (equipment skins, facility decor, UI themes) with no gameplay impact. Extreme caution and strict balancing needed for any Convenience/Quality-of-Life items, ensuring NO P2W perception, core loop disruption, competitive advantage, skipping significant gameplay/progression, or granting unobtainable resources. Player feedback is paramount for these. Manual gameplay and earned automation should always be the most effective/rewarding.  
* **Paid Expansions (Future Major Content):** Substantial new content and significant feature additions (New Maps/Regions, Large Genetic Pool Expansions, Sophisticated Physics Options, Wider Equipment/Materials/Decor, Advanced Procedural Generation, Enhanced Data Tools, Complex Economic Systems, Refined Progression, Staff/Worker AI, Deep Narrative Campaigns, Advanced Processing pathways).  
* **Balancing Monetization & Player Experience:** Ensuring monetization feels fair and respects player time/investment. Transparency is crucial. Monetized content offers substantial value. Monetization is not used to create artificial barriers or frustrate players into spending. Continuous dialogue with the community is essential. Marketplace Tax in the future player market can contribute to developer revenue and serve as a currency sink.
