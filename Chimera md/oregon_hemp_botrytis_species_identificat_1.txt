Three Botrytis species found causing gray mold on industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa) in Oregon A.R. Garfinkel† 
Oregon CBD, Independence, OR 
In September and October of 2019, flowers of hemp plants in Polk and Linn counties in Oregon showed  symptoms of die-back with necrosis of the tissues, resulting in significant yield reductions. The tops of  the inflorescences were often the most severely affected with the infection sometimes moving down  into the petiole or stem. Up to 90% of the plants in these fields had at least one flower infection present,  however, foliar symptoms (lesions) were not observed. Gray to white mycelium and Botrytis-like  conidiophores could often be seen arising from host tissue. The fungus was recovered from colonized  plant tissues either by placing conidia directly onto a Petri dish containing potato dextrose agar (PDA) or  placing a small piece of surface sterilized plant tissue onto PDA. A total of 23 pure cultures were  recovered from three fields. All cultures displayed white to gray, fast-growing mycelium within which  conidiophores sometimes developed bearing Botryose clusters of conidia, followed by the formation of  black sclerotia in all isolates. Since morphology does not allow for distinguishing among cryptic species  in the genus, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) gene sequences (Staats et al. 2005)  were generated to identify species (GenBank accession nos. MN909293-MN909315). Twenty isolates  shared >99 to 100% sequence identity to B. cinerea type specimen isolate B05.10 (accession no.  JQ036050), two isolates shared >99% sequence identity to B. pseudocinerea type specimen isolate  10091 (accession no. JN692414), and one isolate shared >99% sequence identity to isolates representing  a published, but unnamed species of Botrytis (accession no. KY200370 as an example) (Garfinkel et al.  2019). One isolate from each representative species was selected for pathogenicity trials. Isolates LV05  (B. cinerea), LV20 (B. pseudocinerea), and LV07 (Botrytis sp.) were grown on PDA. After 48 hours, plugs  4mm in diameter were cut from the margin of the actively growing colony and placed mycelium-side  down on the inflorescence of potted CBD-type industrial hemp plants. All inoculated flowers were  female and in the receptive stage, displaying white stigmas. Uninoculated flowers were used as controls.  Plants were placed in grow tents and kept at 20°C in the dark for three days under high humidity  conditions. Two plugs per isolate were placed onto four plants each for a total of 8 replicates per  Botrytis species. After 7 days, a dry necrosis or a wet decay of the flowers and surrounding leaves was  visible. Symptoms were often accompanied with profuse epiphytic mycelium surrounding and within the  flower clusters. The symptoms seen in pathogenicity trials were consistent with those seen in the field  and those described in the literature (McPartland 1996) with no obvious differences in the symptoms or  their severity among species. The fungus was re-isolated from plant tissue for every replicate of all of  the three Botrytis species as per the surface sterilization method; the fungus was not isolated from  controls. Although B. cinerea has been reported to cause disease on C. sativa in the state of Oregon, this  work is the first to describe the completion of Koch’s postulates with B. cinerea isolated from Oregon  hemp. Additionally, to our knowledge, only B. cinerea has been previously reported to cause disease on  C. sativa; this is the first time B. pseudocinerea or the novel Botrytis species have been reported on this  crop anywhere in the world. As additional samples are taken from hemp throughout the United States,  these and other Botrytis species will likely be found in Oregon and other growing regions.
