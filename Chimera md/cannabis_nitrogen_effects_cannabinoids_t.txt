1. Introduction  
ABSTRACT  
Secondary metabolism in plants is considerably affected by environmental factors including mineral nutrition.  Nitrogen is a key plant nutrient, known to affect primary and secondary metabolism in plants, that its effect on  the cannabis plants’ chemical profile is not known. To evaluate the hypothesis that N supply affects the  cannabinoid and terpenoid profile, we studied the impact of N application on chemical and functional 
physiology phenotyping in medical cannabis at the flowering stage. The plants were grown under five N treat ments of 30, 80, 160, 240, and 320 mg L− 1 (ppm) under environmentally controlled conditions. The results  revealed that N supply affects cannabinoid and terpenoid metabolism, supporting the hypothesis. The concen trations of most cannabinoids and terpenoids tested were highest under the deficient concentration of 30 mg L− 1  N and declined with the elevation of N supply. The concentrations of the two main cannabinoids, tetrahy drocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), decreased by 69% and 63%, respectively, with the  increase in N supply from 30 to 320 mg L− 1 N. Plant development and function were restricted under inputs  lower than 160 mg L− 1 N, demonstrating N deficiency. The morpho-physiological state of the plants was optimal  at supply rates of 160–320 mg L− 1 N. Inflorescence yield reflected the plant physiological state, increasing with  the increase in N supply up to 160 mg L− 1 N, and was unaffected by further increase in N. These results of the  functional and chemical characterizations suggest that high N supply has adverse effects on the production of  secondary compounds in cannabis, while it promotes growth and biomass production. Hence, N supply may  serve for the regulation of the cannabinoid and terpenoid profiles, or for increasing plant yield, according to the  desired production scheme. Taken together, the results reveal that the optimal N level for yield quantity, that  allows also a relatively high secondary metabolites content, is 160 mg L− 1 N. Finally, the present study provides a  better understanding of the impact of N on ’drug-type’ medical cannabis physiology, and takes us one step closer  to the optimization of medical cannabis cultivation.

Cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.) is used by humanity for thousands of  years for medical use (Chandra et al., 2017; ElSohly and Slade, 2005). In  recent years, its cultivation for modern agriculture and the demand for  medical-grade cannabis products are sharply increasing (Chouvy, 2019;  Decorte and Potter, 2015). The therapeutic effects of cannabis are  derived from its chemical constituents, encompassing hundreds of bio 
logically active secondary metabolites, including terpenoids, flavonoids  and the cannabis-specific cannabinoids (Andre et al., 2016; Russo, 2011;  Shapira et al., 2019).

patients use inflorescences or their extracts for medical use, it is of  outmost importance to produce a plant material that is  chemically-standardized within and between plants and between culti vation batches. In spite of the high demand for the plants’ product, and  the long history of cannabis cultivation by mankind, almost no  science-based knowledge is available regarding regulation of secondary  metabolism in medical cannabis plants, and particularly concerning  effects of environmental and cultivation conditions (Gorelick and  Bernstein, 2017). Such information is essential for the optimization of  cultivation for production of high quality standardized material for the

medical market, as well as for development of plant products containing  specific desirable phytochemical profiles for the pharmacological  markets.  
Environmental conditions are well documented to affect secondary  metabolism, and the accumulation of secondary metabolites in plants.  Exogenous factors such as water supply, humidity, salinity, and nutrient  availability affect production and concentration of secondary metabo 
lites such as alkaloids, phenols, and terpenoids (Dudai et al., 1992;  Gorelick and Bernstein, 2017; Rioba et al., 2015; Seigler, 2012). Only  little information is available about the effects of environmental con ditions on secondary metabolism in cannabis sativa, and reported studies  were conducted mainly with industrial hemp (fiber-type cannabis) that  differs developmentally, morphologically and chemically from medical  cannabis, or as part of forensic attempts to locate the sites of the  illegal-drugs cultivation fields. Some cultivation conditions including  soil properties and light were demonstrated to alter secondary meta bolism in hemp (Coffman and Gentner, 1975; Lydon et al., 1987), light  quality was reported to affect the cannabinoid profile in drug-type  (medical) cannabis (Danziger and Bernstein, 2021), and more studies  of the drug-type cannabis are needed to achieve mechanistic under 
standing of plant response, and regulation of chemical quality.  Mineral nutrients, and especially nitrogen are amongst the main  environmental factors affecting plant development, physiology, and  metabolism (Hawkesford et al., 2012; Lea and Morot-Gaudry, 2001). As  N is the nutrient consumed by plants at the largest quantities, and  required for most metabolic processes, N input is amongst the critical  factors for plant development and function, and is known as a primary  limiting factor in many agricultural systems (Hauck et al., 1984;  Ohyama et al., 2010). Hence, there is ample evidence for the impact of N  supply on plant yield (Bouchet et al., 2016; Lawlor et al., 2001; Leghari  et al., 2016; Tei et al., 1998), and on plant secondary metabolism  (Hakulinen et al., 1995; Koricheva et al., 1998; Palumbo et al., 2007;  Rioba et al., 2015).  
Nevertheless, as medical cannabis is categorized as a dangerous illicit drug in most countries, and research and medical use of the  plant were restricted since the 60’s, only little information is available  about the impact of mineral nutrition, and particularly N nutrition on  the medical ’drug-type’ plant, including inflorescence production and  secondary metabolism. The fertilization studies available for industrial  hemp focused mainly on seed or fiber yield (Aubin et al., 2015;  Ehrensing, 1998; Papastylianou et al., 2018; Vera et al., 2004) and  demonstrate that N supply promotes protein synthesis, fiber production,  and seed yield. From the limited data available on the effect of N on  hemp secondary metabolism, contradictory results were obtained: THC  content in the inflorescences was not affected by N supply in the range  0− 125 mg L− 1 N (Coffman and Gentner, 1977), while THC content in  leaves declined in response to a high nitrogen regime (Bocsa ´ et al.,  1997). As the domestication and breeding of hemp aimed for better fiber  production, it differs from drug-type cannabis in plant development and  secondary metabolism, and therefore likely also in requirements and  responses to mineral-nutrition. It is therefore challenging to deduce how  the drug-type cannabis will respond to N nutrition from the information  available on hemp.  
We have recently uncovered an interaction between plant structure,  function, and chemistry in cannabis, and demonstrated a longitudinal  variability and a variability between organs in secondary metabolites,  mineral nutrients and physiological traits (Bernstein et al., 2019a). We  demonstrated, for the first time, induction of changes in the cannabi 
diom in medical cannabis by nutritional supplements (Bernstein et al.,  2019b), and reported a genotypic variability in medical cannabis  response to K (Saloner et al., 2019) and P (Shiponi and Bernstein, 2021)  at the vegetative growth phase. Optimal plant function and development  under long photoperiod occurred under 175 mg L− 1 K (Saloner et al.,  2019) and 160 mg L− 1 N (Saloner and Bernstein, 2020). Availability of  N, P and K in the soil was also reported to correlate with growth, yield,  and cannabinoids content (Coffman and Gentner, 1977), and in organic  
cultivation, yield production excelled under 389 mg L− 1 N (Caplan et al.,  2017). Current knowledge on responses of cannabis to N input is not  sufficient to direct regulation of secondary metabolism in the medical  plant product.  
The present study therefore aimed to shed light on the interaction  between N and secondary metabolism in medical cannabis. The hy pothesis directing the work plan was that N supply affects functional  physiology and cannabinoids and terpenoids biosynthesis in medical  cannabis, which can direct optimization of the phytochemical profile.  We have therefore studied effects of N supply (30, 80, 160, 240, and 320  mg L− 1 N) on secondary metabolite profile (cannabinoids and terpe noids), and conducted functional physiology phenotyping of the  response of medical cannabis to N supply at the flowering stage. We  analyzed effects on morpho-development and the plant ionome, and  physiological parameters related to water relations, carbon fixation, and  gas exchange, which may affect secondary metabolism.  
2. Materials and methods  
2.1. Plant material and growing conditions  
Medical cannabis (Cannabis sativa L.) plants of the ’Annapurna’  cultivar (Canndoc LTD, Israel) were used as a model plant for the study.  It contains about 7% THC and 7% CBD and has indica characteristics.  Rooted cuttings were planted in 3 L pots in perlite 2-1-2 cultivation  media (Agrekal, Habonim, Israel) 28 days following dissecting from the  mother plants. During the following week, the plants received a uniform  fertilization following the optimal N and K treatments recently reported  by us (Saloner et al., 2019; Saloner and Bernstein, 2020), i.e., 160 mg  L− 1 N and 175 mg L− 1 K, and were cultivated under a 18/6 h light/dark  cycle in a controlled environment growing room, where light was sup plied by Metal Halide bulbs (400 μmol m-2 s− 1, Solis Tek Inc, Carson,  California). After 1 week of vegetative growth under the long photo 
period, the plants were divided to five treatment groups of increasing N  concentrations: 30, 80, 160, 240 and 320 mg L− 1, five plants per  treatment, and were transferred to short photoperiod for the induction  of inflorescence development. For the remaining of the experiment, until  flower maturation 56 days later, the plants were grown under 12:12  light/dark regime, and light was supplied by High Pressure Sodium  bulbs (980 μmol m-2 s− 1, Greenlab by Hydrogarden, Petah Tikva, Israel).  In the cultivation room, temperatures were kept at 26/ 24◦C during the  day and night, respectively, and relative humidities at 44 / 60%,  respectively. The plants were irrigated with a 1 L h− 1  discharge-regulated drippers (Netafim, Tel-Aviv, Israel), with 1 dripper  per pot, 500− 750 ml/pot/day. The volume of irrigation in each irriga tion event was set to generate 30% of drainage. Mineral nutrients were  applied with the irrigation solution at each irrigation event, except at the  last week before harvest when the plants were irrigated with distilled  water without fertilizers to allow flushing of the cultivation media as is  routinely practiced in the commercial cultivation of medical cannabis.  The irrigation solution contained (in mM): 1.93 P-PO42-, 2.76 K+, 1.13  Ca2+, 1.82 Mg2+, 2.5 Na+, 2.04 S-SO42-, 1.6 Cl− , 0.025 Fe2+, 0.012 Mn2+,  0.009 B3+, 0.005 Zn2+, 0.0008 Cu2+, and 0.0003 Mo2+. Nitrogen was  applied at the concentrations: 2.1, 5.7, 11.4, 17.1, and 22.9 mM (e.g.,  30, 80, 160, 240, and 320 mg L− 1 (ppm), respectively), 80% as N-NO3− and 20% as N-NH4+. The irrigation solutions were prepared using: CaCl2,  KNO3, NH4H2PO4, MgSO4, KCl, Ca(NO3)2, H3PO4, (NH4)2SO4, K2SO4,  CO(NH2)2, NH4NO3, MgNO3, and NaOH. Zinc, copper, and manganese  were chelated with EDTA, and iron with EDDHSA. Mo and B were added  as a part of the fertilizers Bar-Koret and B-7000, respectively (Israel  chemicals, Tel-Aviv, Israel). The experiment was conducted in a com plete randomized design with five replicates.

the termination of the experiment, 56 days following commencement of  the N fertigation treatments. The shoots were rinsed twice with distilled  water and blotted dry, and leaves and inflorescences were separated  from the stems. The inflorescence leaves were removed from the in 
florescences by manual trimming, following commercial procedures.  Roots were separated from the soilless growing media, rinsed 3 times in  distilled water and blotted dry. Fresh and dry weights were measured  with a Precisa 40SM-200A balance (Zurich, Switzerland). Dry weights  were determined following desiccation at 64◦C for 48 h (128 h for in 
florescences), and the dry tissue was ground to a powder. The plant  samples were analyzed for total N, N-NO3, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu,  and Na as is described by Saloner and Bernstein (2020) Concentrations  of N-NO3 and N-NH4 in the irrigation solutions were analyzed following  Saloner and Bernstein (2020). Electric conductivity (EC) was measured  with a conductivity meter (Cyberscan CON 1500, Eutech Instruments  Europe B.V., Nijkerk, Netherlands), and the pH was measured with a pH  meter (Cyberscan pH 1500, Eutech Instruments Europe B.V., Nijkerk,  Netherlands). Concentrations of N-NO3 and N-NH4, EC, and the pH of  the irrigation solutions throughout the experiment duration demon strate that the target concentrations of the treatments were reached, and  were stable throughout the cultivation durations (Fig. 3 supplemental).  
2.3. Physiological parameters  
The plants were sampled for physiological analyses 45 days after the  initiation of the fertigation treatments. All measurements were con ducted on five replicated plants, following the experimental design.  
Osmotic potential and relative water content were analyzed as is  described by Saloner and Bernstein (2020). The youngest mature fan leaf  on the main stem, located at the 4th node from the top of the stem was  used for the analyses.  
Membrane Leakage and photosynthetic pigments analyses were  conducted following Saloner et al. (2019). The central leaflet of the  youngest mature fan leaf, located on the fourth node from the plant’s  top, was used for the analyses. The Concentrations of chlorophyll a and b  and carotenoids were calculated following Lichtenthaler and Wellburn  (1983).  
Photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance and intercel lular CO2 concentration were measured with a Licor 6400 XT system (LI COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). The youngest mature fan leaf on the plant’s  main stem, located on the fourth node down the plant’s top, was used for  the analyses. The stomatal conductance and photosynthesis results were  used for the calculations of water use efficiency following Saloner and  Bernstein (2020).  
2.4. Plant morphology and biomass  
Plant height, stem diameter, inflorescence length, and the number of  nodes on the main stem were measured 50 days following the initiation  of the N treatments. Plant height was measured with a ruler as the dis tance from the base of the plant to the top of the main stem. Stem  diameter was measured at the location 3 cm from the plant base with a  digital caliper (YT-7201, Signet tools international co., LTD., Shengang  District, Taiwan). Length of the apical inflorescence of the main stem  [’top inflorescence’] and the apical inflorescence of the lowest 1st order  branch on the main stem [‘side inflorescence’] was measured with a  ruler from the base of the inflorescence to its top. The measurements  were conducted on five replicated plants per treatment, following the  experimental design. Biomass of the plant organs was measured at the  termination of the experiment, 56 days after the beginning of the N  treatments and the short photoperiod. The dry biomass was measured  after drying for 48 h at 64◦C (128 h for the inflorescences). Nitrogen use  efficiency (NUE) is a measure of the dry inflorescence biomass on day 56  divided by the cumulative N quantity that the plants received (g /plant)  throughout the short photoperiod. All measurements were conducted  for five replicated plants per treatment.  
2.5. Cannabinoid and terpenoid analysis  
For the analysis of cannabinoid and terpenoid concentrations in the  plant material, the top inflorescence of the main stem [‘top inflores cence’] and the top inflorescence of the lowest first order branch on the  main stem [‘side inflorescence’] were dissected from the plants 56 days  after the beginning of the N treatments and the short photoperiod. At the  time of sampling, about 30% of the trichome heads were of amber color,  following the maturation stage acceptable for commercial harvesting.  The inflorescences were immediately trimmed (wet-trimmed) to sepa rate the protruding parts of the inflorescence leaves from the inflores cence. The trimmed inflorescences and the trimmed inflorescence leaves  were then dried in an environmental-controlled chamber, in the dark, at  19˚C and 55% relative humidity. After two weeks of drying, the samples  were packed in sealed plastic bags, and set in the dark for two months for  curing prior to analyses.  
2.5.1. Cannabinoid analysis  
The inflorescences and the trimmed inflorescence leaves were  ground manually, to create a homogenous mixture. For each sample, 50  mg of the ground plant material was placed in a 50 mL centrifuge tube,  10 mL ethanol ABS AR (Gadot-Group, Netanya, Israel) was added, the  tube was shaken in a reciprocal shaker for 1 h at room temperature and  then centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 rpm (Megafuge 16 centrifuge,  Thermo-Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The supernatant was filtered  with a 0.22 μm PVD filter (Bar-Naor ltd, Ramat Gan, Israel). Cannabi 
noid concentrations in the filtered plant extracts were analyzed using  HPLC (Jasco 2000 Plus series), which consisted of a quaternary pump,  an autosampler, a column compartment, and a PDA detector (Jasco,  Tokyo, Japan). The detection was carried out in a spectrum mode, at the  wavelength range 200− 650 nm. Chromatographic separations were  carried out with the Luna Omega 3 μm Polar C18 column (Phenomenex,  Torrance, CA USA) in isocratic mode with 75:25 (v/v) acetonitrile:water  and 0.1 % formic acid, at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min− 1. Calculation of  cannabinoid concentrations were based on pure analytical standards:  cannabichromene (CBC), cannabichromenic acid (CBCA), cannabi chromevarin (CBCV), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabigerolic acid (CBGA),  cannabinol (CBN), cannabinolic acid (CBNA), cannabidiol (CBD), can 
nabidiolic acid (CBDA), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabidivarin (CBDV),  cannabidivarinic acid (CBDVA), tetrahydrocannabivarinic acid  (THCVA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany); cannabicitran (CBT) (Cayman  chemical company, Pennsylvania, USA) and tetrahydrocannabinolic  acid (THCA), Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Δ8-THC, tetrahy 
drocannabivarin (THCV) (Restek, Pennsylvania, USA). The influence of  N supply on in-plant decarboxylation of THCA and CBDA was calculated  by dividing the concentration of the non-acidic form by the sum of the  concentrations of the acidic and non-acidic forms for each respective  cannabinoid. R2 values for linear regressions of the calibrations curves of  all cannabinoid standards were >0.994 (Table 1 supplemental);  repeatability, quantified by intra-day variation from extractions of the  same sample (n = 5) was < ±0.8% for all cannabinoids tested. Con centrations of Δ8-THC, THCV, CBDV, CBDVA, CBG, CBNA, CBL, CBCV,  and CBT were lower than the detection limits. Cannabichromene (CBC)  concentration was in the range of 0.2− 0.13% and 0.08− 0.03% for the  inflorescences and inflorescence leaves, respectively (Data not shown).  
2.5.2. Terpenoid analysis  
100 mg of dried plant material was ground in liquid N2 to a fine  powder. Volatile compounds were extracted by vigorous shaking on a  shaker apparatus (200RPM) for 2 h in 2 mL MTBE (methyl tert-butyl  ether), containing 100 ppm of ethyl myristate as an internal standard.  The upper MTBE layer was separated and dried with Na2SO4 and kept at  − 20 ◦C until analysis. The analysis of terpenoids was carried out as  described by Rand et al. (2017), with some modifications. A 1 μL aliquot  of the sample was injected into an GC-MSD system (model 6890 N/ 5973  N, Agilent Technologies CA, USA) equipped with Rxi-5sil ms column (30

A. Saloner and N. Bernstein 
m length x0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness, stationary phase 95 %  dimethyl- 5% diphenyl polysiloxane). Helium (11.18 psi) was used as a  carrier gas with splitless injection. The injector temperature was 250 ◦C  and a detector temperature was 280 ◦C. The initial temperature was 50 ◦C for 1 min, followed by a ramp of 5 ◦C min− 1 to 260 ◦C and 20 ◦C  min− 1 up to 300 ◦C (10 min). The MS data was acquired with a quad rupole mass detector with electron ionization at 70 eV in the range of  41–350 m/z. Identification of the compounds was conducted by  comparing their relative retention indices and mass spectra with those of  authentic samples or with those found in the literature and supple 
mented with W10N11 and QuadLib 2205 GC–MS libraries. A mixture of  straight-chain alkanes blend (C7-C23) was injected into the column  under the above-mentioned conditions for the calculation of the reten tion indices. The amount of the compound in each sample was calcu lated by multiplying the peak area by the response factor of the internal  standard, and dividing the result by the product of the response factor  and the internal standard. Further details concerning the terpenoid  analysis are supplied in Table 2 Supplemental.  
2.6. Statistical analyses  
The data were subjected to a one-way or two-way analysis of vari ance ANOVA (at α = 0.05) and Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test for separation  of means. The data met the assumptions of normality and homogeneity  of variances. Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test at 5% sig nificance level was used for the comparison of means. The analysis was  performed with the Jump package (version 9, SAS 2015, Cary, NC, USA).  
3. Results  
3.1. Plant visual characteristics  
Visual appearance of the plants varied between treatments. Leaf  color changed dramatically from pale yellow to dark green with the  increase in N supply (Fig. 1). Leaves of the low N treatments, 30− 80 mg  L− 1 N, were smaller compared with leaves in the higher N treatments  
(160− 320 mg L− 1 N); the length of the central leaflet of the youngest  mature leaf on the main stem was 8–8.5 cm in the low N treatments,  compared to 10.7–11.2 cm in the high N treatments. A parallel trend was  obtained for the plant’s top inflorescence, i.e., the color of the inflo 
rescence and the inflorescence leaves changed from yellow to dark green  as N supply increased, and plants that received 30 mg L− 1 N had  significantly smaller inflorescences compared to plants that received  higher N level (80− 320 mg L− 1 N) (Fig. 1, 1 supplemental C). These  trends were apparent on the whole plant level as well, and the plants in  the 30− 80 mg L− 1 N range appeared thinner and less dense than the  plants from the higher N range (160− 320 mg L− 1 N) (Fig. 1). Within the  160− 320 mg L− 1 N range, there were no apparent differences in visual  appearance of the plant, leaves and inflorescences, except that the or gans became greener as N supply increased (Fig. 1).  
3.2. Plant growth, biomass accumulation and nitrogen use efficiency  
Plant growth and development, and thus biomass accumulation and  yield, were influenced significantly by the N treatments (Fig. 2). Re sponses to N supply varied between vegetative plant organs, as leaves  biomass increased steadily throughout the N range tested, i.e., up to 320  mg L− 1 N, while root and stem biomass increased only up to 80 mg L− 1 N  (Fig. 2B–C). The response of the reproductive organs biomass to the  treatments, i.e., inflorescences and inflorescence leaves biomass, was  similar to the response for the entire plant biomass; it increased with  increasing N up to 160 mg L− 1 N (Fig. 2A–B). The effect of N supply on  reproductive development (and yield) was substantial. Biomass of the  inflorescences and the inflorescence leaves increased by 206% and  103%, respectively, between 30–160 mg L− 1 N supply. Whole plant  biomass demonstrated a similar trend to the reproductive organs  (Fig. 2A). In spite of the substantial increase in yield with the increase in  N supply, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) decreased dramatically with the  elevation of N supply (Fig. 2D). The morphological analyses indicated  that node formation was not affected by N supply, while inflorescence  length, stem width, and plant height were lower at the 30 mg L− 1 N  treatment compared with higher supply, and did not vary between

3.3. Cannabinoid and terpenoid profile  
Medical cannabis is grown for the female reproductive organs, which  contain a rich chemical profile of secondary metabolites of potential  therapeutic activity. In order to achieve yield of uniform chemical  quality, it is important to examine the concentrations and distribution of  the biologically active compounds in the inflorescences and in response  to growing conditions including N supply. The cannabinoid profile in the  plants revealed a number of significant trends: 1. The concentration of  all the acidic (carboxylated) cannabinoids examined, including THCA,  CBDA, THCVA, CBGA and CBCA, decreased significantly in the in florescences with the increase in N supply (Fig. 3A–B, E, G-H). 2. The  concentration of all the non-acidic (decarboxylated) forms of the can 
nabinoids examined, including THC, CBD and CBN, demonstrated bell shape accumulation curves in the inflorescences, and their concentra tion was highest in the 160 mg L− 1 N treatment and significantly lower  at both lower or higher levels (Fig. 3C–D,F). 3. Cannabinoid concen trations in the inflorescence leaves were generally not altered by N  supply (Fig. 3). 4. The concentration of all the cannabinoids examined  was significantly higher in the inflorescences than the inflorescence  leaves, and there was no substantial difference in the concentration  between the samples taken from the top of the plant (top of the main  stem) or top of lower branches (Fig. 3). The substantial effect of N  nutrition on concentration of the acidic forms of the cannabinoids in the  plant can be seen for example by the 69 % and 63 % decrease in the  concentrations of THCA and CBDA at the top inflorescence, respectively,  under the increase in N input from 30 to 320 mg L− 1. In addition to  treatment effects on cannabinoid concentrations, the decarboxylation of  
THCA and CBDA to their decaboxilated forms was also altered by the N  treatments, revealing a second layer of sensitivity of secondary meta bolism. N supply promoted the in-plant decarboxylation of both of the  
cannabinoids, throughout the N range tested (Fig. 4 supplemental).  The concentrations of most of the terpenoids identified in the plant  material were significantly influenced by N supply, yet the response  varied between different groups of terpenoids (Figs. 4,5). Three main  trends were obtained for monoterpenes: 1. α-pinene and β-pinene con centrations were lower at 30 mg L− 1 N, than in all other treatments,  amongst no significant difference was obtained (Fig. 4A–B). 2. Myrcene  and ipsdienol concentrations were not changed significantly by N supply  (Fig. 4C–D). 3. The concentrations of the majority of the monoterpenes,  including δ-2-carene, linalool, fenchol, (E)-β-ocimene, borneol,  terpinen-4-ol and α-terpineol decreased with the increase in N applica tion, throughout the studied N concentration range (Fig. 4F–L). Ses quiterpenes concentration in the inflorescence also varied between  treatments, and exhibited three trends as well: 1. (E)-α-bergamotene, 5-  epi-7-epi-α-eudesmol and β-selinene concentrations were higher in the  low N treatment of 30 mg L− 1 N, compared with the higher N treat ments, with no further significant differences with increased N con centrations (Fig. 5A,C–D). 2. α-bulnesene and α-guaiene were reduced  with the increase in N input, throughout the N concentration range  studied (Fig. 5K–L). 3. The concentrations of the majority of the ses quiterpenes tested, including selina-3,7(11)-diene, α+β-eudesmol, 10-  epi-γ-eudesmol, eremoligenol or γ-eudesmol, guaiol and α-humulene,  were lower under 320 mg L− 1 N compared with all other treatments,  with no significant differences (Fig. 5E–J). Concentrations of additional  sesquiterpenes revealed the same trends (Fig. 2 supplemental).

3.4. Nutrient concentrations  
In addition to the considerable impact on the quality and quantity of  the yield, N input induced significant changes to the plant ionome, and  mostly to the macronutrient profile (Fig. 6). Increased N supply elevated  N and N-NO3 concentration in the tested plant organs throughout the  studied N concentration range (Fig. 6A–B). Accumulation and distribu 
tion of K in the plant organs was organ-specific (Fig. 6C). Leaf and stem K  concentrations were highest under 30 and 30− 80 mg L− 1 N, respec tively, while accumulation in the roots presented a minimum response  curve with minimum accumulation under 240 mg L− 1. In the inflores cence leaves, K concentrations were highest under 240− 320 mg L− 1 N,

and the concentration in the inflorescence was not significantly affected  by the N regime (Fig. 6C). Phosphorous accumulation n the leaves and  stem were lower under 320 mg L− 1 N and higher under 30− 80 mg L− 1 N,  respectively; root concentrations increased with N input throughout the  studied N concentration range, and concentrations of P in the in 
florescences and the inflorescence leaves demonstrated a maximum  response trend (Fig. 6D). Calcium accumulation in leaves and roots was  highest under 160− 240 mg L− 1 N, and the accumulation in inflores cence leaves exhibited a maximum trend. Accumulation of Ca in stems  and inflorescences were not affected by the N treatments (Fig. 6E).  Magnesium accumulation in the leaves was also highest in the 160− 240  mg L− 1 N treatments, but the accumulation in all other plant parts was

not affected by N supply (Fig. 6F).  
The distribution of micronutrients in the plants demonstrated a  profound organ-specificity, but only a moderate response to N input  (Fig. 5 supplemental). Micronutrient concentrations in the leaves and  the inflorescence leaves were usually not affected by N supply. In the  stem there were relatively high concentrations of Mn and Fe under  30− 80 mg L− 1 N and 80 mg L− 1 N, respectively, while Zn and Cu con 
centrations were not affected by the treatments. Cu and Fe in the roots  increased with the increase in N supply while Zn exhibited a minimum  response curve. In the inflorescence, the concentrations of Fe and Zn  were lowest under the high N treatment, while Mn and Cu decreased  with the elevation of N supply.  
3.5. Photosynthesis and gas exchange and  
Nitrogen is a key mineral element required for plant metabolism,  which is involved also in the photosynthetic process. Accordingly, the  photosynthesis rate was significantly affected by N supply, and it  
demonstrated an optimum response curve, with the highest photosyn thesis rate under the supply range of 160− 240 mg L− 1 N (Fig. 7A). The  rate of transpiration and stomatal conductance did not follow the same  trend, as they were only significantly lower under the high N treatment,  320 mg L− 1 N, compared to the middle treatment of 160 mg L− 1 N  (Fig. 7B–C). As a result, the intercellular CO2 concentration decreased  steadily with the increase in N input throughout the concentration range  studied (Fig. 7D).  
3.6. Photosynthetic pigments and water relations  
The relative water content of the leaves (RWC) was not significantly  affected by N supply (Fig. 7E), although the osmotic potential increased  with an increase in N input (Fig. 7F) suggesting that it reflects accu mulation of N. Water use efficiency (WUEi) also elevated with an in crease in N input, but only up to stabilization under 240 mg L− 1 N  (Fig. 7G). Membrane leakage was highest at the lowest N concentration  (30 mg L− 1 N), compared with all other treatments (Fig. 7D).

4. Discussion  
This study examined the overall response of C. sativa plants to  increased N application, at the reproductive growth stage, in an attempt  to understand the effects of N nutrition on the metabolic, phenotypic,  chemical, and physiological responses of the plant. The results highlight  the importance of adequate N supply, as plant secondary metabolism  was highly affected by N supply, as were gas exchange, photosynthetic  pigments concentration, mineral accumulation, and plant yield. The  salient effect of increasing N supply is the dramatic decrease in canna binoid and terpenoid concentration, which is accompanied by an  improvement in plant growth and physiological status. Our obtained  results improve and expand the ability to regulate medical cannabis  secondary metabolism and yield, and therefore direct researchers and  growers to control the secondary metabolite profile of the plant.  
N is a vital nutrient required by all plants in relatively high doses, for  optimal growth and function (Lea and Morot-Gaudry, 2001; Leghari  et al., 2016; Ohyama, 2010). The cannabis plants suffered from N  deficiency when N supply was lower than 160 mg L− 1 N; Most of the  parameters measured, including photosynthesis rate, photosynthetic  pigments concentration, and water use efficiency were lowest when N  supply was below 160 mg L− 1 N (Figs. 7A,G, 8). The deficiency stress  response was also apparent by the higher level of membrane leakage,  under 30 mg L− 1 N (Fig. 7H), which indicates membrane damage and  overall unstable environment in the plant tissue (Bernstein et al., 2010).  Furthermore, from the nutrient concentrations analysis, it is apparent  that low N supply induced a significant decrease in the uptake and  accumulation of Ca, Mg, and Fe (Fig. 6E–F, 5C supplemental), as was  seen before for other plant species (Kutman et al., 2011; Rayar and van  Hai, 1977), and may involve as well in stress induction. Moreover, N  uptake and accumulation in all plant organs correlated with N supply  (Fig. 6A), and were very low under low N inputs (below 160 mg L− 1 N),  similar to the accumulation response that we have recently reported for  the vegetative growth phase (Saloner and Bernstein, 2020). The impact

of the N deficiency was well apparent visually in the plants of the low N  treatments, which were chlorotic and undeveloped (Fig. 1), displaying  known symptoms of N deficiency (McCauley et al., 2009; Uchida, 2000).  
Many plants respond to excessive nutrient supply and N supply in  particular, by developing toxicity symptoms and impaired growth  (Albornoz, 2016; Choi et al., 1996; McCauley et al., 2009). In a previous  study, we demonstrated that above the optimum of 160 mg L− 1 N sup 
ply, cannabis sativa plants of the same genotype studied in the current  project developed N toxicity stress at the vegetative growth phase  (Saloner and Bernstein, 2020). Surprisingly, at the reproductive phase,  the plants were less sensitive to N excess and did not develop N toxicity  stress throughout the concentration range tested. Elevating N supply,  above 160 mg L− 1 N, induced numerous phenotypic and physiological  responses including: an increase in photosynthetic pigment concentra 
tions (Fig. 8), leaf osmotic potential (Fig. 7F), and plant N and N-NO3  concentrations (Fig. 6A–B), and a reduction in gas exchange parameters  (Fig. 7). Despite these effects, it seems that the plants were not sub stantially affected by the increased N supply, nor demonstrated any vi sual stress symptoms, as can be seen from the well developed and vital  plants and leaves shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, except for the leaves  biomass, which increased gradually with N supply, all other plant organs  did not exhibit any growth changes in response to the increase of N  
application in the range of 160− 320 mg L− 1 N (Fig. 2). Thus, under a  short photoperiod at the reproductive stage, high N concentrations, up  to 320 mg L− 1, do not harm the plants, and the high N amounts taken by  the plants are directed for biosynthesizing more N-rich metabolites such  as photosynthetic pigment and vegetation without impairing cell func 
tion and inflorescence production.  
It is known that plant secondary metabolism can be affected by  environmental and cultivation conditions, and especially by plant  mineral nutrition (Chishaki and Horiguchi, 1997; Gorelick and Bern stein, 2017; Ormeno ˜ and Fernandez, 2012; Rioba et al., 2015). Here, we  report a substantial effect of N supply on plant secondary metabolism, i.  e., on cannabinoids and terpenoids concentration, in the medical  cannabis plant. Cannabinoids and terpenoids are synthesized by  semi-different biochemical pathways. Cannabinoid formation is con ducted in two pathways, the Deoxyxylulose pathway and the Polyketide  pathway, where Geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and olivetolic acid are  formed and transformed into CBGA, which proceeds and transforms into  all the other cannabinoids (Flores-Sanchez and Verpoorte, 2008).  Terpenoid formation is also conducted in two pathways, the Mevalonate  pathway and the Deoxyxylulose pathway, from isopentenyl pyrophos phate (IPP), isopentenyl diphosphate (IPD) or from dimethylallyl  diphosphate (DMAD) (Moghaddam and Mehdizadeh, 2017). All of the

compounds mentioned above, as well as their precursors, do not contain  any N atoms, and therefore, in accordance with our results, a direct  connection between plant N status and their production is not expected  (Figs. 3–5). As mentioned above, the pathways of cannabinoid and  terpenoid synthesis are not entirely separated, as the Deoxyxylulose  pathway and GPP formation participates in both; therefore, it is not  surprising that response trends for their production are similar  (Figs. 3–5).  
Cannabinoids and terpenoids are secondary metabolites, and there fore not required for primary plant metabolism (Vasconsuelo and  Boland, 2007). Hence, we may intuitively assume that plants will pro duce high concentrations of secondary metabolites only while they are  thriving physiologically and energetically, thus having sufficient meta bolic energy to maintain proper primary metabolism along with high  secondary metabolism. In contrast, when plants suffer from stress and

are physiologically impaired, they are likely to invest available energy in  primary metabolism and survival, rather than maintaining high sec ondary metabolism. Contrary to this reasoning, our results, which are  supported by results for other plant systems, demonstrate an increase in  secondary metabolism under stress (Ramakrishna and Ravishankar,  2011; Vasconsuelo and Boland, 2007). Although secondary metabolism  may not be essential for plant survival, it is vital for plant survival in  stress environments. Secondary metabolites are biosynthesized in the  plant as part of defense mechanisms to abiotic and biotic stresses  (Vasconsuelo and Boland, 2007; Wink, 2008; Yamada and Sato, 2013).  They may also play an essential role in non-defensive plant function as  mediators in plant-plant interactions in an attempt to improve  competitive plant abilities in the struggle for vital resources such as  water and nutrients (Joyce et al., 2011; Wink, 2008). Likewise, a defi 
cient supply of nutrients may trigger an increase in plant secondary

metabolism, as was demonstrated by numerous studies before (Blanch  et al., 2012; Vickers et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2020).  
We have recently identified severe N deficiency symptoms and sig nificant stress response under N levels lower than 160 mg L− 1 N at the  vegetative growth phase (Saloner and Bernstein, 2020), and here we  report a similar response at the reproductive phase of development.  Following the tendency of plants to promote secondary metabolism  under stressed conditions, it is plausible that N deficiency stress, which  developed at N levels lower than 160 mg L− 1 N, will elicit secondary  metabolite production of cannabinoids and terpenoids, as is apparent  from our results (Figs. 3–5). It is important to note that contradictory  results are available in the literature for secondary metabolite elicitation  by nutrient deficiency. Production of secondary compounds can be  
increased, decreased or not be affected by nutrient availability (Gorelick  and Bernstein, 2017; Moghaddam and Mehdizadeh, 2017; Ormeno ˜ and  Fernandez, 2012). Although there was a general decrease in the con centration of most cannabinoids and terpenoids with the increase in N  availability, the production of some of the compounds, for example,  α-pinene, β-pinene, and myrcene, was stimulated, or not affected, by N  application (Fig. 4A–C). Also, the increased decarboxylation of THCA  and CBDA with elevation of N supply (Fig. 4 supplemental), suggests  that optimal physiological state promoted in-plant cannabinoid decar 
boxylation, and N deficiency which induced impaired physiological  state delayed in-plant decarboxylation. The involvement of cannabi noids in stress tolerance mechanisms in the cannabis plant is speculative  at our current state of knowledge, and although we have some under standing of the biological activity of acidic versus decarboxylated forms  of the cannabinoids in the human body, no such understanding is  available thus far for plants. It is therefore not known if the in-plant  decarboxylation is a casual response to the changing physiological  environment of the tissue, or reflects involvement in damage or resis tance mechanisms.  
In accord with the hypothesis described above, suggesting that stress  environments induce secondary metabolite production, the counter ef fect of unstressed environments to reduce secondary metabolism was  validated by our results. E.g., high N supply, at the range 160− 320 mg  L− 1 N, was optimal for plant function and development. Consequently,  the cannabinoid and terpenoid content of plants that received optimal N  supply was lower than in the plants which suffered N deficiency.  Nevertheless, secondary metabolism decreased with the increase in N  application to 320 mg L− 1, as concentrations of most cannabinoids and  terpenoids examined decreased even when N supply was optimal for  plant function. Thus, we conclude that the decrease in secondary  metabolite production as N supply increased from 160 mg L− 1 to 320 mg  L− 1 is not due to the plant stress response as was suggested above. The  decrease in secondary metabolite production at the range of 160− 320  mg L− 1 N may be a result of a physiological shift in plant metabolism:  Under high N inputs, plant production shifted to create N-containing  metabolites such as chlorophyll and amino acids, on account of the  production of metabolites which do not contain N, such as cannabinoids  and terpenoids. This hypothesis, which is supported by results for sec ondary metabolism in some other plant species (Albornoz, 2016; Bryant  et al., 1983; Fritz et al., 2006; Rembiałkowska, 2007), can explain the  negative correlation we found between high N supply and secondary  metabolite production (Fig. 3–5), and the positive correlations we found  between high N supply and photosynthetic pigment content (Fig. 8) and  leaves biomass (Fig. 2B).  
Nitrogen is taken up by plants in two different forms, NO3− and NH4+,  which differ in their physiological and metabolic impact on the plant  (Fageria, 2001; Hawkesford et al., 2012; Ups et al., 1990). Therefore, to  receive a comprehensive understanding of N effects on plant function  and secondary metabolism in cannabis, studies into responses to various  NH4/NO3 ratios are required. In addition, as N use efficiency decreased  significantly and dramatically with the increase in N supply (Fig. 2D),  and despite the current market price of cannabis that is much higher  than the price of N fertilizers, growers should take into account the  reduction in plant N use efficiency and make a financial calculations  accordingly.  
5. Conclusions  
From an agronomic perspective, effects on inflorescences biomass  are key to production success. Our results demonstrate that N supply up  to 160 mg L− 1, dramatically increased inflorescence biomass, while  higher application levels did not induce an additional significant effect.  These results are in accord with the overall physiological response of the  plants. Thus, we conclude that 160 mg L− 1 N is a sufficient concentration  for maximal yield and higher N supply did not reduce yield. Taken  together with the negative impacts obtained for high N supply on  
11

A. Saloner and N. Bernstein 
secondary metabolite accumulation, we suggest that the optimal level  for excelled yield quantity, as well as quality, i.e., high secondary me tabolites profile, is 160 mg L− 1 N. As medical cannabis plant-science  research activity is starting to accelerate, and the demand for agricul tural and medical knowledge are soaring, the data obtained from this  research may serve as the foundation for the understanding of medical  cannabis nutrient requirements and physiological responses, and may be  used to direct, precise, and improve medical cannabis cultivation  worldwide.
