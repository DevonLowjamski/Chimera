## **Background and Literature Review**

The electrical systems underpinning indoor agriculture, particularly for cannabis, are characterized by a reliance on technologies that, while effective for plant growth, often result in significant energy consumption. Traditionally, High-Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps have been the mainstay for providing the intense light required, especially during the flowering phase of cannabis cultivation. These lamps, while providing high light output, are also known for their considerable energy usage and the substantial heat they generate, necessitating robust and often energy-intensive cooling systems.  
Maintaining the precise environmental conditions essential for optimal cannabis growth necessitates the use of sophisticated Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. These systems, along with dehumidifiers and air circulation fans, collectively contribute a significant portion to the overall electrical load in a grow facility. The management of these electrical loads in many existing facilities may lack advanced optimization, often relying on basic control mechanisms that can lead to inefficient energy use, particularly during periods of peak electricity demand. Furthermore, the implementation of electrical safety protocols can vary widely across the industry, influenced by facility scale, infrastructure age, and awareness of potential hazards and relevant safety standards.  
Cannabis cultivation presents unique electrical system considerations. The plant's lighting requirements evolve through its lifecycle, with vegetative and flowering stages demanding different photoperiods and light spectra, directly impacting energy consumption. The necessity for precise environmental control, encompassing temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels, further contributes to the electrical demands of these facilities. Moreover, the regulatory landscape for cannabis cultivation is increasingly incorporating considerations for energy efficiency and electrical safety in certain jurisdictions , with electrical codes like the NEC containing specific provisions applicable to these facilities.  
Existing research robustly documents the high energy consumption associated with indoor cannabis production when compared to traditional agricultural practices and other commercial sectors. Studies have quantified the substantial electricity usage per unit area or product yield, underscoring the imperative for more sustainable cultivation methods. A significant area of research has focused on the potential of Light-Emitting Diode (LED) technology to drastically reduce energy consumption in horticultural applications , demonstrating comparable or superior light output for plant growth with significantly lower power requirements and reduced heat generation. Furthermore, ongoing research is dedicated to optimizing light spectra and intensity to precisely match the developmental needs of cannabis plants, aiming to maximize photosynthetic efficiency and the production of desired compounds. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) for intelligent control of indoor farming environments represents another growing area of research, exploring the use of sensor data and machine learning to dynamically adjust environmental parameters for optimal growth and energy minimization. Demand response programs are also being investigated as mechanisms to reduce energy costs and alleviate strain on the electrical grid by adjusting energy usage in response to grid conditions and pricing signals. While existing research provides a valuable foundation, there remains a need for more integrated studies that examine the complex interactions between various electrical systems and their combined impact on energy efficiency, plant growth, and safety within commercial cannabis cultivation facilities. Research that effectively translates theoretical findings into practical applications within the industry is also crucial for driving meaningful change.

## **Principles and Physics of Electrical Systems Relevant to Cannabis Indoor Agriculture**

A thorough understanding of fundamental electrical principles is essential for designing, operating, and optimizing the electrical systems in indoor cannabis agriculture. **Ohm's Law (V=IR)**, which defines the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance , serves as a cornerstone for circuit design and safety analysis. By applying this law, the current drawn by equipment like high-wattage grow lights can be accurately calculated, ensuring appropriate wiring and circuit protection to prevent overloads and potential hazards. **Electrical power (P=VI)**, the rate at which electrical energy is transferred , is crucial for energy management and cost analysis. Determining the power consumption of lighting systems (ranging from hundreds to thousands of watts ), HVAC units, and other equipment is fundamental for designing an electrical service with sufficient capacity. While most facilities utilize Alternating Current (AC) power, some advanced lighting technologies, such as LEDs with direct DC conversion, offer potential efficiency improvements. For large-scale operations with significant power demands, **three-phase power** provides advantages in terms of efficiency and the ability to power heavy-duty equipment.  
Power quality plays a significant role in the efficiency and reliability of electrical systems. **Power factor**, the ratio of real power to apparent power , impacts energy losses and can lead to increased costs if low. Equipment like electronic ballasts and some LED drivers can have low power factors, necessitating research into and implementation of power factor correction techniques. **Harmonics**, which are sinusoidal waveforms at multiples of the fundamental frequency , can be introduced by non-linear loads such as electronic power supplies and variable frequency drives. High levels of harmonic distortion can cause equipment overheating and malfunction , highlighting the importance of identifying and mitigating their sources in grow operations.  
The physics of light is paramount in indoor cannabis cultivation. **Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)**, the range of light wavelengths plants use for photosynthesis , and metrics like Photosynthetic Photon Flux (PPF) and Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD) are critical for optimizing lighting systems. Different light wavelengths within the PAR range, such as blue and red light, have varying effects on plant development , underscoring the importance of selecting the optimal **light spectrum** for each growth stage. Providing the correct **light intensity**, measured as PPFD, is essential for maximizing photosynthesis without causing plant stress. Additionally, the **heat transfer** from lighting and other electrical equipment significantly impacts the grow room environment and the energy required for cooling , making the selection of lighting technologies with lower heat output, such as LEDs, crucial for energy efficiency.  
The physics of environmental control involves principles of **thermodynamics**, governing heat transfer and air movement , and **psychrometrics**, the study of air-water vapor mixtures, essential for humidity control. Plant transpiration significantly influences the grow room's thermodynamics by adding moisture and affecting cooling loads. **Fluid dynamics** principles are relevant to airflow patterns within the grow room, impacting temperature and humidity uniformity and plant health. Efficient HVAC systems must manage both sensible and latent heat loads to maintain optimal growing conditions.
