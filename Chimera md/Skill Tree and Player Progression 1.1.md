**Skill Tree ("Trees") and Player Progression \- Draft v1.1**

**Visual Metaphor:** A cannabis plant, where the main stalk leads to seven primary "Leaves" (categories). Each Leaf, when selected/focused, unfurls or expands to show its individual "Nodes" (unlockable skills/concepts). The size/prominence of the Leaf can visually correspond to its importance/node count. Unlocking nodes might make the plant look more vibrant or complex.

**Skill Point Acquisition Summary:**

1. **Objective Completion:** Main source. Completing guided objectives (which also teach game mechanics) rewards skill points, and unlocking nodes often reveals new objectives, creating a positive feedback loop.  
2. **Successful Harvests:** Rewards skill points based on the quality and outcome of the final crop, incentivizing mastery of the core cultivation loop.  
3. ***(Potential for other minor sources later if needed).***

**Node Unlocking Philosophy:** Unlocking a node introduces the *concept* and its associated mechanics/simulations. Player *mastery* over that concept is then achieved through equipment, tools, and technology progression (often unlocked/purchased separately).

**Presenting Interdependencies Intuitively:**

Instead of a massive web, we can present interdependencies contextually within the Skill Tree UI.

* **Visual Cues in the UI:**  
  * When hovering over a locked node, the UI could highlight any prerequisite nodes in other trees (perhaps with a subtle pulse or connecting line animation).  
  * Required nodes could be listed in the tooltip for the locked node (e.g., "Requires: 'Automated Utilities Installation' \[Construction\] and 'Optimized Nutrient Delivery' \[Cultivation\]").  
* **Logical Grouping/Flow:** Design the layout of nodes within each "Leaf" so that skills that often feed into cross-category advancements are perhaps positioned towards the "edges" of their leaf, visually suggesting connection points.  
* **"Pathway" Suggestions:** The game could subtly suggest logical progression pathways based on the player's current goals or recently unlocked major concepts. For example, after unlocking "HVAC Systems" (Environment), a small UI prompt or breadcrumb might suggest looking into "Advanced Facility Construction (Ducting)" (Construction) next if it hasn't been unlocked.

This is less a hard lock and more a systemic dependency. Better skills elsewhere \= better products \= better business reputation.
