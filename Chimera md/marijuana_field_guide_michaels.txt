Introduction
Marijuana, pot, weed, bud, green—call it what you will, but the popularity of cannabis is at an all-time high. We have finally reached the tipping
point where the negative myths and stereotypes are being debunked and the
positive influences marijuana has on modern medicine, local economies,
individual creativity, and our society as a whole can no longer be denied. And
although marijuana still remains a source of controversy, there has never been
a better time than right now to be a pot smoker.
One of the oldest, most recognized, and versatile plants on earth,
cannabis is used for religious, medicinal, industrial, and recreational purposes.
It has been cultivated, consumed, and enjoyed by mankind since the beginning
of our recorded history. It has affected ancient cultures, languages, and continues to unite the human spirit by transcending gender, race, physical, social,
and economic differences. From corporate magnates to blue-collar workers,
country musicians to rap artists, hipsters to hippies, and everyone in between—
marijuana is one of the few things we all share and enjoy together.
Today, we are in the midst of a “green” revolution where new strains
of cannabis are being cultivated to produce desirable characteristics, unique
traits, groundbreaking medicinal applications, and off-the-charts potency. And
the quality and variety of strains available for the majestic flower of the female
cannabis plant is astonishing. This dizzying array of hundreds, if not thousands
of cannabis strains can be an experienced toker’s dream or leave a novice user
dazed and confused.
How do we navigate through this modern marijuana landscape?
What are the differences between various cannabis strains? Should we care
whether we smoke an indica versus a sativa? What makes all these new hybrid
strains so special?
This field guide is here to help demystify this hazy cloud of uncertainty
by outfitting you with the tools and knowledge necessary for selecting and
enjoying the best buds. You don’t need to be a cannabis grower, breeder, or
“weedophile” to understand that characteristics such as appearance, smell,

Green

taste, and wide-ranging psychoactive effects all play an important role in the
quality of the herb you choose. In order to truly appreciate cannabis, it is essential to understand the unique characteristics each different strain has to offer
and how these characteristics are expressed when smoked or consumed.
Ultimately, it’s feeling the positive psychoactive effects of cannabis
that we all desire. These effects are both psychological and physiological—
mind and body—and can range from relieving pain or stress, to feeling creative
or euphoric, to being stoned or high. While these effects are often subjective,
influenced by experiences and expectations, we can often anticipate or even
predetermine what effects we should expect simply by educating ourselves on
what strain we are about to smoke. This knowledge is vital to ensure that both
recreational and medical marijuana users have the best experience possible.
Much like drinking alcohol, where the effects we feel vary drastically
depending on how much we drink (quantity); who we are drinking with (experience); where we are drinking (surroundings); and what type(s) of alcohol we
are drinking (expectation)—the same holds true for marijuana strains. Quantity,
experience, surroundings, and expectations all play an important role in our
overall enjoyment. But in the case of cannabis, quality holds the throne. The
difference between smoking a dank sinsemilla or some dry schwag can mean
the difference between feeling nice and lifted or feeling bugged out and paranoid.
Thankfully, we are no longer in a time in which we need to settle for
any old weed. Cannabis is now in full bloom, a pot paradise where we can
pick and choose exactly what we like and don’t like—the pungent aroma of a
Skunk strain, the spicy fragrance of a Kush strain, the sour taste of a Diesel
strain, the smooth smoke of a Haze strain, the energized high of an heirloom
Sativa strain, the stoned relaxation of a Landrace Indica strain, and everything in between. The choice is now in our own hands—to grind up, smoke,
and enjoy.
We hope this field guide will not only provide some enlightenment
about this sublime plant, but also act as a small step forward toward
legitimizing what has become a source of contention among the misguided
and miseducated.
It is high time to start exploring the wonderful world of weed.

Cannabis Overview
In order to truly appreciate and enjoy all the wonderful things
marijuana has to offer, we must first lay a healthy foundation of
knowledge on which to build our experiences. Lies, propaganda,
and misinformation about marijuana have proliferated throughout history and it is only through proper education and the sharing
of accurate information that we can start to undo the harm this
has caused. Famous scientist and botanist George Washington
Carver wisely said, “Education is the key to unlock the golden
door of freedom.” Hopefully, with the help of the enlightenment
provided in this book, we can all continue to spread the truth
that has already begun turning this key.

What Is Marijuana?
Figuratively, marijuana is
earth’s greatest gift to mankind.
Physically, marijuana is a
natural body and mind–altering
treat. Literally, marijuana is the
budding flower of the female
cannabis plant.
But what makes marijuana so desirable
is that it naturally produces a multitude
of diverse chemical compounds called
“phtyo-cannabinoids.” When consumed,
these cannabinoids produce a variety of
wide-ranging effects on the human mind
and body by activating and stimulating
our body’s internal cannabinoid receptors.
All humans and animals naturally possess
these “endo-cannabinoids” receptors.
This complex cannabinoid system is the
very reason cannabis has been consumed
for both recreational and medicinal
purposes by ancient cultures and modern
societies alike.
The most well-known cannabinoid is
called delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
It is the psychoactive chemical that produces the desirable “high” or “stoned”
feeling when consumed.
The other primary cannabinoid is
known as cannabidiol (CBD). It has been
found to be an effective treatment for a
wide range of health conditions and thanks
to modern scientific research, we’ve finally
been able to quantify and prove these
health benefits.

Basic Plant Anatomy
The botany of the cannabis plant can be as mysterious and complex as, well, cannabis
itself. Unless you’re a botanist, the differences between a stipule and calyx may be too
much information to really care about. That being said, to truly appreciate its natural
wonder, all marijuana tokers should have some token of understanding about this
amazing plant’s structure. So here’s the rundown of what is vital:
A. Flowers

C. Fan Leaves

E. Sugar Leaves

The flowers, or buds,
of the female cannabis
plant is what we harvest,
manicure, dry, cure, and
ultimately consume.
These buds hold the highest concentrations of cannabinoids with the most
notable being THC. The
largest bud that grows at
the very top of the plant
is called the “cola.”

The fan leaves are the big,
beautiful, ubiquitous leaves
we see everywhere being
used as the unofficial logo
for marijuana. Other than
being a visual symbol for
cannabis, the fan leaves’
job is to “fan out” and take
in all the light the plant
needs to grow. Fan leaves
do not contain any significant levels of THC so they
won’t give you any psychoactive effects and are
typically discarded after
harvesting.

Unlike the fan leaf, the
small sugar leaf actually
contains a good amount of
cannabinoids because it
grows within the bud itself
and gets coated with trichomes, which gives it the
appearance of being covered in sugar. Most of the
sugar leaves are pruned
away from the bud when
harvested and are used to
make edibles like cookies
and brownies or concentrates like hash and wax.

D. Leaf Anatomy

Buds grow in clusters at
the end of each stem.
Stems support the buds
structurally but also store
important nutrients and
help transport water from
the roots. After all their
hard work, the stems are
often discarded since they
contain little to no THC.

B.Trichomes and Pistils
All the chemical compounds found on the bud
are encased within the tiny
resin glands or “crystals”
(called glandular trichomes)
seen on the surface of the
bud. The red or white
“hairs” (called pistils) that
grow out of the bud are a
sign of a well-grown plant
but do not contain any
cannabinoids and are not
an indicator of potency.
B1. Trichomes
B2. Pistils

female. A female plant
won’t produce seeds if
pollination from a male
plant is prevented. Often
referred to as sinsemilla,
these seedless buds tend
to grow larger with higher
resin and cannabinoid
content, making them
more desirable. Besides
being used to grow new
plants, cannabis seeds
are a nutritious food and
a good source of protein.
The oil made from cannabis seeds can also be used
as a renewable fuel source.

F. Stems
The fan leaf has become
the iconic and universal
symbol for pro-marijuana.
The individual leaves
themselves are serrated
and there are usually
seven or nine leaflets per
healthy fan leaf(there can
be as many as eleven).
Here’s the basic structure
of our beloved leaf:
D1. Leaﬂets
D2. Bracts
D3. Petiole

G. Seeds
The seeds produced by
the cannabis plant are typically half male and half

H. Stalks
Much like the stem, the
stalk is also useless for
consumption. However,
the long fibers found in
the inner bark of the stalk,
called hemp, can be utilized in other ways. Hemp
is an extremely strong,
durable, and versatile fiber
that is used to make paper,
rope, oil, biodegradable
plastics, clothing, and
other textiles.

What Are Strains?
A marijuana strain is simply a particular variety of the cannabis
plant. Not so simple is the breeding process and genetic makeup
within each strain. Lucky for us all there are master growers,
creative breeders, and other amazing minds hard at work behind
the scenes hunting for, cloning, and creating all the super strains
that are available to all of us today.
But you don’t need to be an expert to
understand that all strains fall into one
of three main categories: (1) sativa,
(2) indica, or (3) hybrid. Sativa and
indica strains are the two main naturally
occurring species, and hybrid strains
are a mix of the two. As new hybrid
strains are developed they are crossbred
with other existing strains, giving growers
endless opportunities to experiment and
produce the next great strain. No matter
if a strain is a natural variety or a hybrid,
each will have very specific qualities
and unique psychoactive effects (What’s
Your Phenotype, see page 18).
As more and more strains become
available, it can seem overwhelming to
figure out which ones are best to procure
and enjoy. You obviously can’t rely on
all the crazy and unusual names given to
these strains, so what do you do? For
starters, it’s best to begin by narrowing
down your choice to the variety type.
Sativas are known for being a “daytime”
strain because they provide you with an
uplifting and energetic head high. Indicas
on the other hand are a better “nighttime”
strain and will get your body stoned, making you feel relaxed, mellow, or even sleepy.

Hybrids provide a combination of
effects that depend on the strains’ lineage—
their parents. Typically these hybrids are
either indica or sativa dominant, meaning
they will express the characteristics of
the dominant variety with less characteristics of the secondary variety. An indicadominant hybrid might give you a strong
body buzz without feeling tired, or a
sativa-dominant hybrid may make you
very sociable and cheerful but still calm
and relaxed. Other times, a hybrid can
be a “true” hybrid, meaning that it is
an even mix of both varieties.

RUDERALIS is a short, hearty, wild strain with fewer leaves and low THC content. It is not used for consuming
but is sometimes crossbred with indicas or sativas to produce an “autoflowering” hybrid—meaning it will

What’s Your Phenotype?
The term phenotype or “pheno” will inevitably come up when
talking about cannabis strains. It’s one of those heady words that
is actually pretty basic in concept but very complex in nature.
By definition, a phenotype is simply any living thing’s observable
characteristics. In the cannabis plant these traits include size,
shape, color, THC content, bud density, flavor, and smell to name
a few. All these various traits can come together in a multitude of
combinations adding to the complexity and variety of strains.
Seeing and smoking an assortment
of strains will help you to start noticing
these distinctions in phenotypes and more
importantly help you to figure out what
traits you like or don’t like. If you prefer
an energetic high, a pure sativa strain like
Durban Poison (see p/166) will carry that
trait. Or if you prefer the mellowing smoke
of an indica strain, than maybe a strain
like Platinum OG (see p/298) is worth
trying. There are even strains bred with
amazing flavors like Bubble Gum (see
p/114) or Blueberry (see p/104).
It’s the strain’s unique combination
of phenotypes that makes each strain so
distinct and special. Each strain is carefully bred to express very specific trait
combinations with all this information
stored right into its own DNA. This unique
genetic makeup—referred to as the strain’s
“genotype”—is what allows the same strain
to be grown again and again. The genetics
will always be the same but sometimes the
phenotypes can vary—this is what you
call “variations in phenotype.”
Variation in phenos in the same strain
is okay, but if they’re completely different
than either the plant was improperly
grown or you’re not getting what you paid

for. This is why educated smokers talk
about phenotypes and why it’s so important to know which phenos to look for
when trying new strain varieties.
For example, every bud shown here is
the same strain called Girl Scout Cookies
(see p/182). Each bud came from the same
genetic code but is grown from different
producers or crops. As you can clearly
see, not all buds from the same genotype
will look or behave the same. This is why
when you buy Girl Scout Cookies from
one source, that bud’s characteristics may
vary slightly from the same strain bought
elsewhere. Maybe the color is slightly off,
or perhaps the smell is more pungent, or
maybe the effects don’t last as long.
Why? Most often, it’s the environment
that directly affects a strain’s phenotypes.
Things like where the plant was grown,
soil conditions, fertilizers, even the light
or water source can directly effect the
strain’s inherent ability to properly
express its desired traits—some may be
suppressed while others may be exaggerated. Ultimately, it’s how these phenotypes are revealed that will determine
whether or not you have an award winning
bud or a poorly grown dud.

use artiﬁcial light under
a completely closed
environment—soil, water,
fertilizers, even temperature and carbon dioxide
levels are monitored
and controlled. This
method often produces
strains coated in precise
crystals with very high
potency and consistent
phenotypes throughout
the crop.
Outdoor strains on the
other hand use natural
sunlight and interact with
the terroir, the unique
land and climate of a
speciﬁc location. This
produces larger plants
that are generally more
robust to combat Mother
Nature’s variables like
wind and weather. The
ﬂavors and resin glands
are also often more
complex and viscous.
Simply put, indoor
growing is more scientiﬁc
while outdoor growing
is more artisanal. Either
way, if the cannabis plant
is grown properly and
to its full potential, the
resulting buds will be
spectacular.

Beyond THC
The Entourage Effect
The cannabis plant’s chemical compounds are what make it so
magical, and these unique cannabinoids are found nowhere else
in nature. While THC may be the most famous feel-good cannabinoid since 1964, isolated then by prized chemist Raphael
Mechoulam, more recent research has isolated over 75 other
unique cannabinoids from cannabis.

strain might. Or a high THC combined
with high tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV)
may provide an energy-filled night similar
to drinking tequila or a vodka energy
drink, while high levels of CBC and THC
may give more of a dreamy sensation,
like an absinthe. Furthermore, as with
alcohol, a person’s own body chemistry
will make an important difference in
the overall experience.

POTENCY
PERCENTAGES
The strength or
potency of each cannabinoid is measured
through a process
called chromatography, which separates
and measures each
cannabinoids percent
of weight compared to
the overall weight of
the sample. Percentages and ratios will vary
with each strain but
here are the typical
breakdowns found in
most buds:

THCV < 1%

CBC < 1%

CBG < 1%

CBN < 1%

CBD 1-4%

THC 8-20%

Klaas Hesselink and Derek Houston of
Cannatest, based in Western Washington,
provide cannabinoid analysis to determine cannabinoid profiles or fingerprints
of cannabis strains. Klaas and Derek stress
that nature put a TEAM of molecules
in the cannabis plant that work together
to create an effect that these molecules
cannot effectively do alone. This team
effort is called “The Entourage Effect”
(coined by Dr. Mechoulam). A good
example to illustrate this effect is the fact
that a high 21% THC flower with 3%
of cannabigerol (CBG), may actually feel
less potent than a 16% THC flower with
1% cannabichromene (CBC) or fewer of
the other modulating cannabinoids.
Here’s what else these experts have to say:
Cannabis chemistry is like alcohol
chemistry; we have established that each
cannabinoid contributes to a different
pharmacological effect, so it makes sense
that mixing these chemicals at varying
ratios will change the user’s experience.
For example, drinking a heavily hopped
IPA beer will likely relax and tire one in
the same way as a heavy CBG-filled Kush

It is the primary psychoactive
component responsible for
the “high” effect. It ampliﬁes
all sensory functions such as
sight, hearing, color sensitivity, and increases arousal
and a greater sense of
well-being. This component
produces strong feelings of
euphoria, sharpens the mind,
and promotes creativity.

Not psychoactive, CBD
works antagonistically in the
micromolar range; it has an
opposite effect of THC and
provides no high to users.
It actually reduces the psychoactive effect of THC,
but in contrast, it prolongs
the “high” effect. CBD is
effective against anxiety
and stress as well as causing
strong muscle relaxation,
especially in the smooth
muscle ﬁbers, therefore
reducing muscle spasms.
Concentrated CBD extract
is also a highly effective
anti-seizure treatment.

It is mildly psychoactive and,
just like aspirin (but three
times as strong), CBN is a
non-narcotic-type analgesic
and is effective at relieving
tension headaches. CBN is a
breakdown product of THC.
During storage (aging) CBN
will slowly increase as THC
deteriorates.

CBC is a nonpsychoactive
cannabinoid that also potentiates THC. It interacts in an
as yet unknown way with
THC to make the “high” more
intense and pronounced. It
is also considered a strong
sedative and pain reliever.

plant varieties and has thus
far been found only in trace
amounts in most marijuana
strains.

Therapeutic effects: appetite
suppressant, stimulant, anticonvulsive, anti-inflammatory
A psychoactive cannabinoid
found along with THC in cannabis, research has shown
that, in low doses, THCV will
increase the effects of THC
(strongly potentiating THC,
provoking a heavy, stronger,
and faster “high” effect).
In larger doses, however,
THCV is believed to oppose
the effects of THC.

Terpenoids
Aromas, Flavors, and
Therapeutic Effects
In addition to cannabinoids, the components of the cannabis
plant’s essential oils, called terpenoids, play an important therapeutic role in the overall entourage effect. The aromas and flavors
of any given cannabis strain also depend on which terpenoids
predominate. While nearly 20,000 terpenoid compounds have
been found in all types of plant life, just over 200 of these terpenes
have been identified in cannabis with the following eight occurring in significant amounts and most frequently.

Linalool

hops don’t contain any
THC but do have similar
terpenoids that give
pungent beers like IPAs

marijuana.

Landraces
All of today’s strains inevitably derive from pure, ancient
cannabis plants found throughout the world and referred to as
“landraces.” Landraces occur naturally and adapt to a particular
region, over a long period of time, without any external influences. Franco Loja from Amsterdam’s Green House Seed Co.—
the most awarded seed bank in the world—has been traveling
the planet in search of these rare landraces with a group known
as the Strain Hunters. Following is what Loja has to say:

Why Are Landraces Important?
Cannabis is one of the essential resources
of our planet. Landraces represent the
most ancient pure form of cannabis we
have available, perfected by Mother
Nature over hundreds, sometimes over
thousands of years, constantly adapting
and evolving, improving their harmony
with the environment they live in. The
plants are larger and generally more
vigorous; buds usually form more complex
resin that contains more cannabinoids
and terpenes. If allowed to develop
large in size, these seeds and plants give
massive yields. Perhaps most importantly,
landraces are the basis for breeding and
necessary to creating new and different
strains of cannabis.

How Many Different Landrace
Varieties Exist?
There are many cannabis landraces
almost all over the world. Arjan Roskam,
founder of Amsterdam-based Green
House Seeds, has been traveling and

collecting landraces since the 1980s.
He traveled to Southeast Asia to collect
landraces in Vietnam, Cambodia, and
Laos, and later on to Africa and South
America. Since we started the Strain
Hunters project, back in 2008, we have
collected landraces and documented
our travels. We have been to South
Africa, Malawi, India, Morocco, Trinidad,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Jamaica,
Swaziland, and more recently to Colombia
with the crew from Vice.com.

Are Landraces Mostly
Indica or Sativa?
It really varies with the region, but you
can say that the only continent on earth
where there are true indica landraces is
Asia, especially in the Hindu Kush area
(Afghanistan, Pakistan, North India,
South China). For the rest, landraces in
Africa, South America, and Central
America are generally sativa; while
landraces in Europe and North America
are usually low-THC hemp. An exception
is North Africa (Morocco) and Central

marijuana smokers to the next.

Arjan always says, “If you are looking
for cannabis, find man first,” because
man uses cannabis and man propagates
cannabis the most, since the beginning
of our existence. In most cases the real
landraces are found within poor, isolated
rural communities in remote areas of third
world countries. Landraces are always the
dominant plant in their own environment
and always overpower any “intrusion.”
Unfortunately, many landraces are at
risk of extinction because of eradication
programs or crop-replacement government programs, as it happened in Jamaica
and Trinidad. We feel it is our duty to
preserve these cannabis landraces for the
future of scientific and medical research,
and for the basic human right to use a
beneficial plant.

Mixing genes is always a good thing for
the development of any species. This is
one of the basic rules of genetics, valid
for all forms of complex life on this planet.
The thousands of strains available today
are the result of over 40 years of breeding
in the western world. Cannabis breeding
as we know it began on the West Coast
of the United States and Canada in the
mid-1960s—and it hasn’t stopped. It just
kept spreading and increasing exponentially. However, there is a need for
injecting new genes into the mix. And the
best “new” genes are “old” landraces,
for the simple reason that they have been
inbreeding and selecting themselves on a
massive scale for a long period of time.

What Are the Most Valuable
Landraces?

Sativa landrace originating
from Panama

All landraces are valuable, simply
because they are plants at risk of being
lost forever. Some landraces are more
famous than others, and more in
demand. The legendary names from the
hippy times are still popular today; from
the 1970s: Punto Rojo and Colombian
Gold, or Malawi Gold, Durban Poison,
Limon Verde—these are all very special
plants and genetics with a real history.

Buyer’s Guide
When it’s time to finally part with your hard-earned cash and buy some buds, it’s
important to know what to look for in order to make sure you’re getting your money’s
worth. If you’re able to buy from a legitimate marijuana dispensary then you can trust
the weed is going to be stellar. The dispensary’s “bud-tender” will be able to detail
each strain’s specific phenotypes or they will be able to recommend a strain based on
your own preferences. But if you’re like the majority of recreational smokers, you have
to build a trusted network to score some dank nugs. Even still, there’s always a chance
your regular hookup could have some bad weed from time to time or your budget
simply can’t afford the best. So here are some important things to examine and rate
to determine if the buds make the grade.
LOWS, MIDS,
AND HIGHS
Marijuana can be
broken down into
three quality grades:
low, mid or “regs,”
and high. Here’s a
quick comparison
of the three:

Pedigree
Was the cannabis grown
from a reliable source?
More often than not, you’re
going to have to take a leap
of faith and take the seller’s word.
Once you build a strong bond with your
source, hopefully they’ll share more
grow information with you. On the
other hand, if you’re buying from a
dispensary you can always ask them
about the genetics, how the cannabis
was grown, and other valuable information so you can keep tabs and refer
back to the growers or breeders you
trust when trying a new strain.
NEW HOOKUPS

When buying from a new source, whether
it be a new dispensary or new friend-ofa-friend’s source, make sure that at first
you buy only a small amount to test their
product before purchasing larger amounts
the next time around. Any reputable source
will respect this gesture and it could save
you from wasting your time and money on
a bad connection.

Weight
Was the herb prepackaged
or was it weighed in front of
you? Avoid prepackaged
buds and opt for a freshly
weighed amount. If you have no choice
but to pick a prepackaged baggy, make
sure you examine the contents before
handing over your money.

Appearance
Do the buds look appealing?
At first glance, you should be
excited when looking at the
bud. It shouldn’t be crushed,
compressed, or crumbly looking. It
should have a nice distinct fluffy nugget
shape and the colors—greens, reds,
and/or purple hues—can be light or
dark and should look clean and vibrant,

not dull and dirty. The bud should also
look nicely manicured, meaning all the
bigger leaves and extra stems trimmed
off nicely; not left on or hacked away.
TRICHOMES

Can you see tiny crystals
all over the bud? Your
buds should have plenty
of clear or amber- tinted
resin crystals if you expect
to get the most effects from
it. Ideally, it will be glistening with crystals
but sometimes storing and moving can cause
some to fall off, which isn’t a big deal. But
if they are seen in odd patches, or there are
only a few crystals, or none at all then the
herb was not properly taken care of and you
shouldn’t pay top dollar for it.

Feel
How does the bud feel when
you touch it? Properly dried
and cured buds should be
neither dry nor wet; neither
rock-solid nor brittle. The bud should
feel dense and squishy. When you break
it up, it should be easy to grind and feel
sticky. It shouldn’t crumble into a fine
powder (too dry) or clump into hard
balls (too wet). Any stems should bend
then break when bent, not just bend
without breaking or quickly snap off.

Smell
Does it smell appealing?
The aromas should be
pleasant and appetizing to
you. Chances are if you like
the way it smells, you’ll love the way it
tastes. Just keep in mind that smell has
nothing to do with potency, just flavor.
Some of the best and strongest buds
can smell very harsh and even skunklike or can just have a slight, subtle
fragrance. One exception is if the buds
smell very “green”—sort of like fresh
lawn clippings—then it probably wasn’t

cured properly and won’t be tasty or
potent. The other is if it smells “dirty.”
DIRTY WEED

Sometimes improperly
grown or stored weed
can grow mold and/or
mildew. If the bud smells
moldy, very muddy, or like
ammonia, then chances
are it has mold. If you see white stringy stuff
or an unnatural white coating on the exterior,
that’s definitely a sign of mold or mildew.
Both of these are bad signs and you shouldn’t
buy it, never mind smoke it.

Personal Experience
How did it make you feel?
Above all else, this is the
most important factor to
consider when buying bud.
This is a very personal preference that
only you can experience, so it’s worth
taking notes and keeping a journal on
which strains you’ve tried, where you
bought them, and what you enjoyed
(or didn’t enjoy) about them so you can
start appreciating and recognizing all
the wonderful and distinct experiences
various strains have to offer.
THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS

New users and experienced smokers alike
might sometimes experience a few negative
effects after toking a new strain. Don’t
panic, these minor side effects are temporary and should wear off quickly, so just
relax and let the time pass. If they mess with
your high, stop using that strain and try a
new variety next time.

100 Bona Fide Cannabis Terms
Using code words for marijuana has always been
commonplace among stoners.
The word “marijuana” or
“marihuana” became popular
in the 1930s when our federal
government literally made
up this exotic sounding
name for cannabis in an
attempt to scare the public
and vilify its use. As with
all things related to cannabis,
our government got it
completely wrong and this
most popular name has
been embraced and adopted
by potheads worldwide.
The Office of National Drug
Control Policy has since
issued a shocking 647 official
“street names” for marijuana
and once again failed (does
anyone really call it “dinkie
dow”?!). So, here is a list of
acceptable A–Z terms with
more positive vibes. Use
these for your own personal
enjoyment or as inspiration
when creating your own
cannabis code.

One of the easiest choices you can make when
procuring your marijuana is the actual amount
you want. The most important thing to remember
is how many grams are in each amount so you
don’t get shorted. Here’s a rundown of the standard weights available to purchase along with
their common “code” names.

Sometimes you can
buy weed for a dollar

typically “eye balled”
amounts and aren’t the

Keep It
Fresh
Properly storing your buds is crucial to keeping them fresh,
flavorful, and potent for a long time. Excess light, heat, and
humidity will damage the weed and diminish its potency.
Poor storage is what makes good buds go bad but thankfully
it’s pretty easy to keep them fresh and sticky.
SHELF LIFE

No Bags

Handling

Properly stored marijuana will stay fresh and
potent for months on
end losing only around
5–10% of its potency
annually, while improperly stored marijuana can
lose much of its value
and potency within a
few short weeks.

Plastic sandwich “baggies” were not
intended for storing your buds, they’re
just a cheap and easy way to package
them for selling. Baggies not only dry out
your buds, they won’t protect your buds
from getting crushed, and the plastic also
causes a static that attracts and pulls
crystals away from the buds. Make sure
you transfer your buds into a proper
container as soon as you can.

Too much handling will cause the
crystals to fall off so don’t fool around
with your nugs other than pulling them
out from the jar right before you’re ready
to use them. Also, make sure to avoid
constantly opening and closing your
containers—air will dry out your buds.
And never add any extra moisture to your
weed, including peels from fruits or
vegetables. This can cause bacteria and
mold to grow and ruin your stash.

Airtight
To store your herb, an airtight glass
jar is best. You can use a simple mason
jar with a screw-top lid or invest in one
designed specifically for weed. Even a
small Tupperware-like container or a
prescription pill bottle will work. Either
way, make sure the container is airtight
and the appropriate size. You don’t want
a jar that’s too big with a lot of extra air
trapped inside and you don’t want to
crush and cram the buds into the
container to fit.

Storage
Store your nug jar indoors in a cool, dry,
and dark place. A simple drawer or
cabinet will do the trick. You just don’t
want your stored buds in temperatures
below 40 degrees Fahrenheit and above
80 degrees Fahrenheit and you definitely
don’t want the temperature to fluctuate
all the time. Also, avoid refrigerating or
freezing your buds. Constant changes
in the refrigerator’s humidity levels is a
major problem and freezing temperatures
will actually cause all the trichome crystals
to freeze up and break off the bud.

Bud and Beyond
Buds are the most popular and widespread choice when
it comes to buying and consuming cannabis. Aside from
buds, cannabis can also be made into a variety of other
potent products in the forms of concentrates and edibles.
Following is an overview of the variety readily available.
DECARBOXYLATION

Natural Forms
Cannabis as Mother Nature
intended—natural, pure, and
unprocessed.
Raw

then dry cured to produce wonderful
buds ready to enjoy. Proper drying
and curing is essential to lock in
potency while enhancing the overall
flavor and aroma of the bud. Buds
are ultimately enjoyed in a multitude
of smoking and vaporizing options
(see Smoking Options, page 36).

Kief

Freshly cut flowers from the plant
can be eaten raw. Although it requires
very large quantities, some therapeutic effects can result, but any
psychoactive effect is diminished.

Buds

The ripe flowers are harvested from
the plant, precisely manicured, and

Kief is another word for the trichome
crystals that have fallen off or have
been manually sifted from the leaves
and flowers using a screen. Kief is a
raw powder form and can be added
to buds when smoking, or can be
compressed into balls or blocks
called pressed kief or hashish.

All forms of cannabis need
to be heated, burned,
ignited, or vaporized at some
point in order to activate its
chemical compounds. This
activation of cannabinoids
is called decarboxylation. In
other words, without the heat
you won’t get high.

Primer

p/33

Concentrates
Concentrates are cannabis
products made by extracting
the cannabinoids and terpenes
from the plant using a variety
of mechanical extraction
processes. The resulting
“extractions” are comprised
of 60–90% THC content and
are the most potent forms of
cannabis available—getting you
much higher, much quicker.
Hash
Using a cold ice water extraction
technique, trichome resins become
separated and isolated from the
plant material through a filtration
system. The filtered material is then
compressed into a final cake form.
Hash’s quality is dependent on the
proportion of plant material to
trichomes, the less plant material
the better. These varying qualities
can be visually measured when the
hash is heated—it will either
“bubble” or “melt.”

Bubble Hash

Half Melt Hash

It contains less plant material than
Full Bubble Hash. Half Melt Hash
will melt at first and then turn into a
gooey matter as it continues to heat.

BHO (butane hash oil or butane
honey oil). Oils can come in many
different colors, shapes, and sizes
depending on the strain used, type
of solvent, purging method, and the
overall consistency. Following are
some of the most common types
you’ll run into.

Shatter

Full Melt Hash

This is the highest quality of all
hash. Made up of mostly pure
trichomes, Full Melt contains only
trace amounts of plant material—
leaving very little to no residue
after it’s heated.

Shatter, sometimes called “glass,”
has a consistency similar to hard
candy or glass. It gets its name
because it often shatters like glass
when a piece is broken off.
Other terms: amber glass, glass, sap

Wax

Oil

It contains the most plant material
of all the hash varieties and thus
“bubbles” when first lit. If it bubbles
throughout the entire heating
process, it is called Full Bubble.

Oil, sometimes called “hash oil” or
“wax,” is made using a complex
extraction process that involves lab
equipment, heat, vacuums, and
solvents like alcohol, butane, or
carbon dioxide (CO2) to extract the
trichome resins from the plant. Most
waxes are extracted using butane
and are commonly referred to as

Wax has a consistency similar
to modeling clay. This form is very
popular since it is fairly easy to
handle and vaporize.
Other term: earwax

710

Concentrates (continued)
Budder

Honeycomb
While the code term 420 is
synonymous with smoking
buds, the term 710 is code
for dabbing oils—710 upside
down spells O-I-L.

DABBING
Budder is very sticky and is
created by whipping the wax after
the solvent has been purged off.
Whipping aerates the oil and gives
it a cloudier appearance. The end
result has a similar look and
texture to peanut butter.
Other term: taffy (a glossier version
of budder)

Very similar to crumble, but during
the purging process, air bubbles
form inside the wax due to low purging heat. The wax doesn’t melt and
the air pockets don’t collapse,
leaving small holes throughout.
Other term: moonrocks

QWISO

Crumble

Crumble has a dry, crumbly texture
similar to brown sugar, making it
very easy to handle.

Quick wash isopropyl alcohol
hash oil (QWISO) is a way to make
hash oil without using butane or
carbon dioxide gases. Ground buds
are soaked in isopropyl alcohol for
a short time. A filter is then used to
separate the alcohol from the plant
material and the filtered alcohol
is left to evaporate off, leaving
behind your QWISO.

Although concentrates can
be added to your bud when
smoking, concentrates are most
often used alone and vaporized
by using a torch to heat a titanium or glass element. The
concentrate is then applied or
“dabbed” onto the hot surface,
vaporizing the concentrate
instantly. The resulting vapor is
usually ﬁltered through a water
pipe. Glass bongs and bubblers
that are made for concentrate
use are called “oil rigs.”

DON’T OVER EAT

p/35

Edibles
Tea

When smoking marijuana the
effects can be felt almost
instantly, within minutes. When
enjoying edibles, it can take up
to one hour to feel anything.
The effects gradually increase
as the body digests the edible.
This long digestion makes it
very hard to judge how much
you should actually eat and
also produces a much longerlasting and stronger body high
compared to other forms of
marijuana.

NO NEWBIES
If you are a new or inexperienced user of marijuana, kief,
concentrates and edibles are
not good options to experiment with. These forms are
very potent and are recommended for experienced and
veteran users only.

A cannabis tea can be made by
boiling ground buds in water and
adding cream or milk to make the
THC more soluble.

Tincture

Enjoying foods and drinks
infused with cannabis is a
tasty alternative to smoking.
Popular cannabis edibles
include brownies, cookies,
cakes, cupcakes, fudge, caramels, and lollipops. Since heat
is necessary to activate the
THC and other cannabinoids,
simply grinding up your weed
and adding it to a recipe will
give you very little psychoactive
results. The key component to
edibles is either cooking your
cannabis or creating a cooking
butter or oil infused with
THC that is then used in your
recipes to create the edible
of your choice.
Canna-butter
By slowly cooking finely ground up
buds and leaves with dairy butter
you extract and transfer the THC
and cannabinoid oils into the butter.

Oil
The same process can be used to
make cooking oils, olive oil, canola
oil, or vegetable oil and can also
be infused with THC and cannabinoid oils.

An alcoholic extract, decarboxylated buds and leaves are soaked
in a high-proof alcohol spirit. The
resulting liquid is then consumed
by placing a few drops on your
tongue or by adding to recipes
and drinks.

Salve
By melting cannabis infused oil
with beeswax you can create a
topical cream that can be applied
to the skin.

Smoking Options
The legendary Bob Marley once said, “When you smoke the herb, it
reveals you to yourself.” Smoking is and always has been the most
common way to enjoy marijuana—dating back thousands of years
across many different cultures worldwide. Smoking herb is also a social
activity, done communally among friends old or new, passing, sharing,
and bonding over a common experience. In today’s cannabis culture,
there’s an assortment of tools and methods used to light it up.
Joint

cone or bat shape and are very popular in
Europe. If you’re smoking with others, it
is customary to let them know your spliff
contains tobacco before passing to them.
In Jamaica the term “spliff ” refers to a
regular joint containing no tobacco.

Blunt
A joint is literally a marijuana cigarette,
ground-up bud twisted in a rolling paper,
and one of the most popular ways herb is
smoked. Joints are relatively easy to roll
(see How to Roll, page 40) and even easier
to pass around. They’re also great for
customizing based on how much weed
you add—from an oversized “doobie” to
a thin “pinner.”

Spliff

A spliff is nearly identical to a joint except
loose tobacco is mixed in with the herb
before rolling. Many spliffs are rolled in a

Blunts are ground buds rolled in the
outer tobacco leaf wrapping of a cigar or
prepackaged “blunt warps.” Compared
to joints, blunts are much larger, burn
much slower, and can be passed around
many more times. The tobacco wrapping
does affect the overall flavor of the herb
but is still a preferred method by many
experienced smokers, who take great
pride in how well they can roll them.
“Blunted” is a term used to describe
how one feels after smoking a blunt.

PREPARING
BUDS
Breaking up your weed
is a labor of love and
an important step in
any smoking process.
Pulling the sticky buds
away from the stem
(and occasional seed)
and breaking up the bud
is key to an even burn
and smooth smoking
experience. Simply use
your ﬁngers, sharp
scissors, or buy a special marijuana grinder
to get the job done.

Pipes

Pipes are relatively small, easy to use,
and well suited to be passed around,
making them a popular smoking tool.
Often called a “bowl,” pipes are traditionally made out of a variety of materials
including glass, metal, wood, stone,
corncob, or even homemade out of apples
or aluminum cans. The overall best bowls
for smoking herb are handblown glass.
Your standard pipe consists of:
1
2

BOWL: to hold the herb
CARB: A side opening (carburator)

used to control air ﬂow
STEM: to collect the smoke
4 MOUTHPIECE: to hold against your lips

This straight pipe is open on both ends
and smoked upright through cupped
hands so as not to touch your lips.
Although they take some practice to use,
chillums provide one of the strongest hits
you can get from a pipe.

3

Bubbler

Simply pack, light, and inhale. When
holding the pipe around the bowl, make
sure to cover the carb while lighting the
herb. Opening the carb allows for more
airflow and is done to clear all the smoke
from the stem as you finish taking your hit.
Pipes also come in a variety of shapes and
sizes, such as the following:

One Hitter

A one hitter or a “bat” is a small, discreet
pipe that only holds enough weed for a
single hit. They are very convenient to
transport, conceal, and easy to use.

A bubbler is a glass pipe with an additional
chamber that holds a small amount of
water—and it is referred to as a water pipe.
The smoke is filtered through the water
chamber to offer a much smoother hit
than other dry pipes.

A bong is technically a water pipe, but
in the form of a larger, upright standalone unit with a much more sophisticated anatomy. A bong is made up of
the following parts:
1 CHAMBER: holds the water and
collects the smoke
2 BOWL: to hold the buds
3 SLIDE: the “male” unit that the bowl
is attached to
4 DOWNSTEM: the “stem” or “female”
unit that the slide inserts into
5 MOUTHPIECE: used to draw and ﬁll
the chamber with smoke
6 BASE: to keep the bong steady
when not in use

To hit a bong, light the bud, and inhale
from the mouthpiece. Once the chamber,
is full, the bowl and slide are pulled out of
the downstem as you continue to inhale.
With the downstem now open, air will
release the smoke from the chamber
causing it to rush into your lungs and
making for a big hit. Always place the
bong down on its base when you’re done.

Like a bong, a hookah is a freestanding
water pipe except it has multiple, flexible
hoses extending from its large base unit.
The smoke is filtered through the water
and then out through the hoses where
multiple smokers can simultaneously
draw steady long hits at a leisurely pace.

Vaporizers
Better Flavor Proﬁles
Vaporization is going to be far more
honest as to what the truth of the plant is
than smoking ever can be. Because the
body of the plant is being heated up more
sequentially, more evenly, the lighter
flavor components will tend to come off
in a body, as a group, and you’ll have the
experience of sensing all the terpenes’
nuances and honest flavors.

Requires Less Herb
Since vapor consists of 95% pure cannabinoids there is very little waste making for
optimal use of your herb. Your supply can
last up to four times longer.
Vaporizing has become a popular modern
method for consuming high-grade herbs.
Unlike all the other smoking methods,
vaporizers do not involve ignition. Instead,
vaporizers use electricity to heat herb
to just below the point of combustion; emitting a “vapor” that is smoke free and consisting mainly of pure cannabinoids and
terpenes. Vaporizers come is many forms
from tabletop plug-in units, portable battery powered handhelds, or even adapters
that fit traditional water pipes.
Forrest Landry, inventor of the famed
Magic-Flight Launch Box Vaporizer,
explains why vaporizing has become
so popular:

Cleaner Than Smoking
Vaporized herb has little to no smell with
no tars or any other by-products from
traditional smoking methods. You’re also
not burning or consuming any plant matter, including chlorophyll or cellulose.
You are just inhaling pure cannabinoids
and terpenes.

A Clearer Experience
You will have a clearer, cleaner, more
euphoric experience since you’re not
absorbing any of the other by-products
from combusted smoke. Also, the
components that are being released have
lower volatilization temperatures and tend
to have more euphoric characteristics.

How to Roll
Rolling a perfect
joint is a right of
passage for any
true smoker. Even
if you prefer other
smoking methods,
knowing how to
roll is still a necessary skill to master.
What You Need
To roll a perfect joint,
you’ll need between
½ to 1 gram of your
favorite strain (ground
up), a rolling paper,
and a crutch.

Step 1

Step 2

Step 3

You can make the
crutch, or mouth piece,
out of any thick, cardboard-like paper.

Lay the crutch in the
paper with about ¼ of
it hanging off of the end.

Fold the paper and hold
the joint by the crutch—
make sure the glue strip
is at the top.

choice is to rip
*off Aa good
piece of the rolling
paper packaging, or ﬁnd
a business card to use,
or use actual ﬁlter paper.
Roll the crutch into a
tight cylinder.

Make sure the paper’s
glue strip is facing you.
Now put your ground
bud in the paper.

Then with your other
hand, pinch the paper
together above the bud
and gently start rolling,
moving evenly towards
the center and then
outwards.

Spread it out with your
ﬁngers until it’s even.
Now we’re ready to start
rolling.

WHY THE
CRUTCH?
1. It gives the joint
structure.
2. It makes the joint
easier to roll.
3. You don’t get weed
in your mouth.
4. No roach clip
needed at the end.

It’s best to let your
*thumbs
do the work while
your ﬁngers support the
joint itself.

Primer

p/41

Step 4

Step 5

Step 6

Final Step

Continue rolling evenly
back and forth until the
bud holds its cylindrical
shape on its own.

Now comes the hardest
part, the tuck. Roll the
paper down so that the
long end is away from you.

Starting at the tip and
working your way to the
crutch, seal the joint.

Spark it up and enjoy
your creation.

If your bud isn’t too dry,
when you lay the joint
ﬂat it should hold its
cylindrical shape.

Now use your thumbs
to press the short end of
the paper into the gap
between the long end
of the paper and the
crutch. As you press it in,
you can use your pointer
ﬁnger to guide the short
end of the paper under
the long one.

*

Just make sure it’s not
compressed too tightly,
otherwise the joint will
be too hard to hit and/or
won’t stay lit.

Continue rolling until you
only have a little bit left.
Then lick the paper.

Finish off the joint by
packing down the bud in
the open end using a
poker, like a pen or pencil.

Lastly, push the crutch
into the bottom end until
it’s ﬂush; this helps to
ensure that the material
at the base of the joint
gets packed tightly.

Smoking Etiquette
Sharing pot has been
ingrained within the
cannabis culture since the
very beginning. It’s what
brings us together and what
allows us to not only share
our herb, but also share
our ideas, stories, laughter,
and good times. Proper
etiquette or “headiquette”
dictates that a set of good
manners be practiced as a
sign of respect to the herb
and to the friends we’re
about to enjoy it with.

Puff and Give
“Puff. . .Puff. . .Pass” when smoking a joint,
spliff, or blunt and “Puff. . .Pass” when
smoking other paraphernalia. This golden rule
will ensure that everyone gets to smoke an
equal amount and keeps the rotation moving.

Keep the Rotation
It’s common practice to pass to your left-hand
side but whichever way the rotation starts
make sure you stay with the same rotation
until everyone has had a turn. Just don’t
“bogart” or take forever to take your hits,
even if it’s your weed. Take your puffs and
keep the rotation moving.

Take the First Hit
The person who rolls or packs (no matter whose
weed it is) gets the option to light up the first
hit, or they can give the honor to another
person of their choice. The first hit is often
referred to as getting “greens.”

Leave Green Hits
When smoking from a bowl, try not to torch all
the green in the bowl. With the right lighting
angle you can burn half or a third of the green
and be able to pass another fresh “green hit”
for the next person to enjoy. This is known as
“cornering” the bowl.

Keep It Dry
Don’t slobber or drool on whatever it is you are
smoking from; no one likes to take a hit from a
wet blunt or slobbering mouthpiece. And if
you’re sick, never take a hit from something
others are going to smoke from too.

Primer

p/43

Cashed Out
If after you hit a bowl you think that all of
the weed has been smoked and the bowl is
pretty much empty, it is common courtesy
to tell the person you are passing to that
you believe it may be “cashed.”

Enough for Everyone

really want to know, pull them aside after
the session and ask them in private.

House Rules
If you’re at someone else’s place, make
sure you ask the host if it’s okay to smoke
and where they prefer it happen, and
make sure to ask them if they want to join.

Make sure you break up enough weed
for everyone in the circle to have at least
one hit. If a bowl’s been cashed before
everyone has had a hit, make sure you
pack some more and give it back to the
proper person in the rotation.

If a friend hooks you up with some
herb, it is common courtesy to offer them
the opportunity to smoke some at the
exchange.

Join In

Lights Out

If you’re trying to join a session that’s
already begun, don’t just cut in. Always
ask the group if it’s okay to join and
where you should wait in the rotation.

Don’t ever let a lit joint or blunt go out
because you were talking too much or
“politic-ing” or just spaced out. If you’re
too high or are in a serious conversation
just step out of the rotation.

Good Hook ups

Don’t Hit and Run
Always try to stay in the group until the
session is over. Never take a hit and
immediately leave.

Never Pocket a Lighter
At the end of a session, don’t keep the
lighter if it’s not yours. Always make an
effort to give it back to its owner.

Return the Favor
You should do your best to reciprocate if
you can. Don’t always be the guy showing
up with no smoke. If you have some bud,
always ask to contribute to the session or
offer to use it for the next session.

Keep It Private
Unless you’re close friends, don’t ask how
much another person’s nugs cost, or
where and if you can buy some. If you

Respect Others
Never blow smoke in anyone’s face, don’t
peer pressure anyone into smoking if
they don’t want to, and never complain
or talk down about other people’s weed.
If you don’t like it, don’t smoke it. But if
someone has dank buds, or even rolls a
nice joint or blunt, it’s appropriate to
give a nice compliment.

Myths and
Misconceptions
Marijuana prohibitionists
have been using false propaganda, misinformation, and
flawed study results in an
attempt to influence drug
policy and manipulate the
general public into thinking
marijuana is bad for you.
One only need watch the
1936 film Reefer Madness to
understand this idiocy. But
is pot really bad for you?
Julie Holland, MD, editor of
The Pot Book, is part of a
new generation of researchers helping to debunk these
myths and redefine the role
of cannabis in today’s world.

MYTH
Cannabis Is a Schedule I Drug
Julie Holland, MD:
The United States has taken out a patent on the
use of cannabis as a neuroprotectant, though
they continue to keep the plant in Schedule I,
reserved for drugs with the highest potential
for abuse and no medicinal use. Groups of
physicians and nurses, including the American
Medical Association, have requested a
review of this scheduling. And THC pills,
which can get you extremely altered, are
listed in Schedule III. It makes no sense to
list the whole plant in Schedule I when
one compound of the plant is available by
prescription in the same safety category
as Xanax and Vicodin.
It is very difficult to perform Schedule I
research in any institution, but the truth is,
it’s easier to get permission to give heroin or
cocaine or methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA) to research subjects than it is to
get our government to release cannabis for
therapeutic studies. Because the government
will not allow, never mind fund therapeutic
studies, and big pharma isn’t very well going
to help either, clinical research depends on
private donations for sustenance.

MYTH
Cannabis Kills Brain Cells and Destroys
Your Memory
Julie Holland, MD:
Cannabis is nontoxic to the brain. It in no way
kills brain cells, and it has been proven to be
neuroprotective, that is, sparing brain cells that
are exposed to toxins or lack of oxygen.

Primer

p/45

While you are intoxicated with cannabis
you have diminished working memory, but
once the drug wears off your memory
returns intact.

MYTH
Cannabis Is a Gateway Drug
Julie Holland, MD:
There has never been convincing evidence
of cannabis being a gateway drug, but there
are some anecdotal reports of alcoholics
as well as heroin and cocaine addicts being
maintained on cannabis instead of their
more toxic drug of choice. Also, there is
new evidence that CBD may help people
quit smoking cigarettes.

MYTH
Cannabis Is Highly Addictive
Julie Holland, MD:
While a minority of people can become
addicted to cannabis (and others can
become addicted to gambling, or to
Facebook, or internet porn) most people
who use cannabis do not become addicted.
Among cigarettes, heroin, cocaine, alcohol,
and cannabis, the rates of addiction are
lowest for cannabis (and highest for cigarettes). Also, the withdrawal syndrome
for cannabis is mild and short-lived.
Alcohol withdrawal is potentially deadly.

MYTH
Cannabis Has No Medical Value
Julie Holland, MD:
Cannabis is an ancient medicine that has

been used for millennia to treat insomnia, anxiety, menstrual cramps, nausea,
and loss of appetite. It is the oldest known
domesticated plant and plant medicine,
with medicinal texts from 2,000 and
3,000 years ago mentioning the plant.
It was listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia
until the 1940s.
Just because you make a drug illegal
doesn’t strip it of its medicinal properties.
THC is a Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)–approved drug to treat nausea
and pain. Sativex (an extract of THC and
CBD) is approved in forty countries to
treat muscle spasms of Multiple Sclerosis.
Oncologists worldwide recommend cannabis to fight the side effects of chemotherapy, and in a recent survey, 70% of doctors
would recommend medicinal cannabis
to a patient who could benefit from it.
Through proper education and research
people can be educated to change their
views on pot, will avail themselves of
medicinal cannabis and also choose a
drug for recreation that is less toxic and
more health-sustaining than alcohol,
cigarettes, or many other commonly
used substances.

NORML Principles of
Responsible Use
When marijuana is enjoyed
responsibly, subjecting
users to harsh criminal and
civil penalties provides no
public benefit and causes
terrible injustices. The oldest and largest marijuana
legalization organization
in the country, National
Organization for the Reform
of Marijuana Laws (NORML)
has provided a voice in the
public policy debate for
those Americans who oppose
marijuana prohibition and
favor an end to the practice
of arresting marijuana
smokers. For reasons of
public safety, public health,
economics, and justice, the
prohibition laws should be
repealed to the extent that
they criminalize responsible
cannabis use. By adoption
of this statement, the NORML
Board of Directors has
attempted to define “responsible cannabis use.”

I. Adults Only
Cannabis consumption is for adults only.
It is irresponsible to provide cannabis to
children.
Many things and activities are suitable for
young people, but others absolutely are not.
Children do not drive cars, enter into
contracts, or marry, and they must not use
drugs. As it is unrealistic to demand lifetime
abstinence from cars, contracts, and marriage, however, it is unrealistic to expect
lifetime abstinence from all intoxicants,
including alcohol. Rather, our expectation
and hope for young people is that they grow
up to be responsible adults. Our obligation to
them is to demonstrate what that means.

II. No Driving
The responsible cannabis consumer does
not operate a motor vehicle or other dangerous
machinery while impaired by cannabis,
nor (like other responsible citizens) while
impaired by any other substance or condition,
including some medicines and when fatigued.
Although the use of cannabis is said by most
experts to be safer than alcohol
and many prescription drugs, responsible
cannabis consumers never operate
motor vehicles in an impaired condition.
Public safety demands not only that impaired
drivers be taken off the road, but that
objective measures of impairment be
developed and used, rather
than chemical testing.

Primer

p/47

III. Set and Setting

V. Respect Rights of Others

The responsible cannabis user will carefully
consider the set and setting, regulating use
accordingly.

The responsible cannabis user does not
violate the rights of others, observes accepted
standards of courtesy and public propriety,
and respects the preferences of those who
wish to avoid cannabis entirely.

“Set” refers to the consumer’s values,
attitudes, experience, and personality; and
“setting” means the consumer’s physical
and social circumstances. The responsible
cannabis consumer will be vigilant as to
conditions—time, place, mood, etc.— and
does not hesitate to say “no” when those
conditions are not conducive to a safe,
pleasant, and/or productive experience.

IV. Resist Abuse
Use of cannabis, to the extent that it impairs
health, personal development, or achievement, is abuse, to be resisted by responsible
cannabis users.
Abuse means harm. Some cannabis
use is harmful; most is not. That which is
harmful should be discouraged. Wars
have been waged in the name of eradicating “drug abuse,” but instead of focusing
on abuse, enforcement measures have
been diluted by targeting all drug use,
whether abusive or not. If cannabis abuse
is to be targeted, it is essential that clear
standards be developed to identify it.

No one may violate the rights of others,
and no substance use excuses any such
violation. Regardless of the legal status
of cannabis, responsible users will adhere
to emerging tobacco smoking protocols
in public and private places.

regarded as the birthplace of modern-day
hybrid cannabis cultivation. This strain consists of elite genetics combined with great
breeding skills to produce a nice one-off
hybrid that’s as potent as it is stinky. The

This variety of the renowned OG Kush is
rumored to have origins that trace back to the
famous rap artist and marijuana advocate
Snoop Dogg. Regardless of the rumors,
Abusive OG is no doubt a prime example of
an OG—very dense nugs heavily coated in
crystals with a unique sour pine flavor commonly referred to as “kushy.” These buds’
ability to deliver a long–lasting, body-buzzing
high is what makes Abusive OG a cut above
the rest.

The Legend of OG
When “OG” is used in a strain name, it typically
refers to its lineage back to the original OG Kush
strain. The initials OG are thought by most to
mean “Ocean Grown” for OG Kush’s roots in
Southern California, while some attribute OG to
mean “Original Gangster” to represent the first
generation of a strain. Semantics aside, OG strains
are widely popular and highly coveted for their
distinct flavors, appearance, and enduring effects.

characteristics as evident in the pungent
aroma and piney aftertaste. The smoke produced from this hard-hitting hybrid will
expand your lungs and then quickly expand
your mind with its strong sativa presence.
The extreme potency of Bio Diesel only
requires a few small puffs to provide a
long-lasting and well-rounded high.

The dark, rich purple color of this beautiful
strain is what makes this elusive bud a unique
treasure. The genetics of the strain are largely
unknown but is is thought to have some
genetics of the Bubble Gum strain. While the
flavor of this bud is a tasty combination of
black cherry mixed with a creamy finish
(giving it its obvious name), it’s the deep and

Its effects are very relaxing and body calming

the rest is history. This urban legend has since
become a go-to choice when creating many of
today’s popular hybrid crosses. This rare

provide an uplifting full-body high with no
tiredness and a clear mind. G-13 is a superspecimen of a pure indica.

The University of Mississippi is home to the only U.S.
government–sanctioned cannabis farm and lab.
They have been growing, storing, documenting, and
studying cannabis since 1968—all paid for by U.S.

The Hog is a potent strain that has its roots in
Tennessee. These short, fat buds have a
greasy complexion and are covered in gooey
resinous trichomes. Its very distinct and
dank odor can be misleading as this flower
produces a nice smooth and slow-burning
smoke. The effects are very indica with an
intense full-body buzz, but what makes Hog’s
Breath so unique is its ability to not cause any
of the fatigue typical of such a strong indica.

OG Kush

OG Kush and its phenotypes are perhaps the
most common cannabis variety available
today. This legendary strain originated out of
Southern California in the mid 1990s. While
the genetics of OG Kush are heavily debated,
its popularity is undeniable. The dense little
nuggets have a classic sweet-and-sour flavor.
Coupled with a long-lasting and powerful
body buzz and euphoric mind state, it’s no
wonder OG Kush has risen to such high
demand. Various growers have used cuttings
from the OG plant to grow popular phenotypes of their own—spawning an OG craze
throughout California and gaining mythical
stature.

world. Its distinct and intoxicating aroma will
fill up a room with scents of lemon and diesel
gas (in a good way) and its fast-acting psychedelic high will shoot straight to your brain and
fill you up with copious amounts of good
uplifting energy. “Sour D” made a name for
itself on the East Coast and is still one of
the most widely smoked and sought-after
strains of all time—this bud truly is the Diesel
of all dank.

are apparent in the relaxed state you will
