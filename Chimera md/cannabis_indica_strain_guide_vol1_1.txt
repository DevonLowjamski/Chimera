Dedication by S.T. Oner


“I don’t care if I fall as long as someone else picks up my gun and keeps on shooting.”
— Ernesto “Che” Guevara


As always, I dedicate this book to the fine people at NORML and everyone who has
fought against the unjust war on this incredible plant. Now more than ever, the drug law
revolution is in sight, and the above quote from one of the 20th century’s most inspira-
tional figures should serve as encouragement for us all. Though some may have fallen
– the wonderful and very much missed Jack Herer coming immediately to mind – the
rest of us must battle on. Education is our weapon and eventually, our war will be won.


I almost feel like the most insignificant part of this wonderful project; the smallest of
cogs in a vast and expansive machine that’s been working for hundreds of years. My
greatest thanks go to Mother Nature herself, for giving rise to this plant that has
changed innumerable people’s lives for the better.


My most heartfelt thanks also go to the fantastic breeders and seed companies whose
work appears between these pages. This book features breeders from the USA,
Canada, Holland, Britain, Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland, South Africa, Russia,
Australia, Ukraine, New Zealand, and Denmark, and quite a few other countries which
cannot be listed due to certain draconic laws against this most holy of plants.


There are some contributors who wish to remain anonymous, but who deserve recog-
nition and respect nonetheless, as does everyone on the online forums, especially
the people at Breedbay.co.uk, thcfarmer.com and icmag.com.


Finally I must thank the growers, breeders and writers who inspired me to learn more
about this incredible plant; Ed Rosenthal, Jason King, Danny Danko, Mel Thomas,
Mel Frank, Greg Green, and Jorge Cervantes are some big ones, and of course the
aforementioned Jack Herer, may he rest in peace. These guys are true trailblazers
and their tireless efforts set me on my first steps on this wonderful journey. I feel that
Cannabis Indica Vol. 1 is a true representation of the variety of cannabis genetics in
existence today, and were it not for the hard work and effort of everyone featured in
it, it would not exist at all. For this, I say thank you.

Preface

A Trip With Indica



Just by picking up this book, you are playing a small but important role in the global
cannabis community.
   Whether you’re a grower, a breeder, a daily smoker, an occasional toker, a medical
user, an activist, a connoisseur, a horticulturalist, a coffeeshop owner or the kingpin
of a growing empire, you are reading this book for one reason and one reason only:
you love cannabis!
   I wrote it for the same reason.
   This book is much more than a few pages of information about the strains that you
smoke on a daily basis. This book is the result of months of tireless research, tracking
down growers, writing emails, calling nonexistent phone numbers, hunting down
breeders from places I’d never even heard of, and digging through years of folklore
and rumor to get to the truth about strains we know and love as well as newcomers
to the scene. It’s the result of years, and sometimes decades, of passion and hard
work on the part of the breeders, who dedicate their lives to not only growing this
most sought-after of plants (in many cases risking unwarranted jail time and massive
federal charges) but also to taking the best of the cannabis plant and making it even
better. This book may not have a central narrative but the breeders are the true heroes
of the story; they are the nuclear physicists of the movement, pushing their own limits
and those of their plants, without whom we’d still be stuck in the dark ages of cannabis
cultivation.
   These heroes aren’t just the celebrated faces we know, gracing the covers of pot

  magazines and the pages of growing forums the world over; many breeders featured
  here are unsung heroes of the terrible and costly war on drugs. They might not have
  thousands of dollars to spend on industrial grow rooms or a staff of 20 to produce a
  new and exciting variety, but they do have more tenacity and drive than many of us
  could ever hope for. These breeders take their most precious plants, the ones they’ve
  lovingly grown right from seed, and walk them through generations of backcrossing
  and crossbreeding, choosing the best phenotypes, enhancing the best traits of each
  and stabilizing them until they have a brand spanking new and original strain to call
  their own. And if this wasn’t enough, they then seed the thing and offer it up to the
  rest of us. We can never be grateful enough.
     In this book, I have tried to include a good representation of every corner of the
  cannabis community: from the established, world-renowned growers that you’ve all
  heard of, such as the formidable Sensi and Green House Seeds; through the pioneers
  you might not have heard of but whose strains you have definitely smoked, like DJ
  Short and The Joint Doctor; all the way to the absolute unknowns, who grow just for
  the sake of growing, because they love what they do, such as Russia’s Original Seeds
  and Sativa Tim from the USA. This book contains indica-dominant strains from every
  corner of the world to provide a truly global view of the cannabis community as it
  stands today.
     That’s not to say, however, that the big hitters in the seed game don’t deserve our
  respect. Dutch Passion, Sagarmatha Seeds and Soma Seeds are all represented
  here and, indeed, their work in the field of cannabis cultivation has paved the way for
  many smaller companies and individual breeders as well as influencing and improving
  global opinion of cannabis as medicine. Some of the best and most stable genetics


       Cannabis Indica The Essential Guide to the World’s Finest Marijuana Strains

available come from the futuristic labs of such companies, and these varieties more
often than not form the building blocks from which new strains are created.
   As you flip through these pages, you’ll notice that some strain names come up
time and time again. These are the superstars of the breeding world, the strains that
changed the way we grow weed and the way we appreciate it too. The prevalence of
the Blue family genetics within this book is a testament to the quality of Canadian
breeder DJ Short’s Blueberry, a strain that has been around since the 70s. Blueberry
has become a legend unto itself, known for its high yields and fruity taste, but most
of all for its lavender-colored buds that are so popular on the street that they fetch a
higher price than most other varieties. Almost every seed bank now has its own Blue
offspring strain, many of which are featured in the following pages, and there are now
generations upon generations of plants that can be traced back in one way or another
to Grandma Blueberry.
   Kush is a name that you will definitely have heard, and I don’t know a smoker who
doesn’t get a gleam of excitement in their eyes when you tell them that you’ve got a
stash from this family, whether it be Garberville Purple Kush, Kamoto Kush, Olivia
Kush or any of the myriad of strains that don’t even list that heritage in their names
but still exhibit the incredibly potent and euphoric high that the Afghani/Pakistani va-
riety is so loved for. Kush is revered as a classic strain – and deservedly so.
   And it’s not just the elders of the strain world that demand respect. Lowryder, the
now infamous plant engineered by the genius Joint Doctor, is one of the more con-
temporary game-changers and continues to spawn an increasing number of tribute
varieties. Using the genetics of cannabis ruderalis, a species that had been formerly
overlooked by breeders due to its inability to get you high, the Joint Doctor created a

  hybrid that became the first auto-flowering cannabis strain in the world: a plant that
  managed its own growth, moving into the flowering stage when it was good and ready
  rather than when its grower remembered to change its light cycle. This blew the doors
  off the indoor growing industry – from the biggest companies to the rookie cultivator –
  because of the ease of growing these plants and the productivity of a Lowryder crop.
  The auto-flowering market has since exploded. There are whole companies now ded-
  icated to producing auto-flowering cannabis plants and, again, almost every seed bank
  has an auto-flowering variety of their best strain. It’s nothing short of a phenomenon.
     There’s another recent phenomenon in the growing world that I feel I need to ad-
  dress: the listing of THC percentages. It has become popular in recent years to list a
  THC rating for strains, with the rationale that this is a great indicator of potency. While
  the level of THC produced by a plant does dictate how baked the bud will get you, it’s
  actually very difficult to test this and get a definitive result; there are numerous meth-
  ods of doing so and every one has its drawbacks. Even before the bud gets to the
  testing stage, however, there are problems with assigning one trait to a whole strain.
  Imagine that you grow a crop of White Widow, and have it tested at, say, 15% THC.
  Then imagine that you grow another crop, exactly the same, but you’ve changed your
  brand of humidifier and this one has a red ‘on’ light instead of a green one. You prob-
  ably wouldn’t even notice, but your plants would notice the difference when, in the
  dark periods, they found themselves bathed in the red glow of the tiny new ‘on’ button
  rather than their familiar green friend. Such a minute difference can have a huge im-
  pact on the health, vigor and, yes, even the potency of a plant, and a one-size fits-all-
  approach to rating a strain does not account for this at all.
     With this in mind, the percentage of THC listed is still a huge, huge selling point


       Cannabis Indica The Essential Guide to the World’s Finest Marijuana Strains

for strains, so the practice of ignoring this difficulty and claiming an absolute potency
has become predominant. At the very best, the ratings are unstable and cannot be
taken as fact, and in the very worst instances, these levels are straight up invented;
it’s no coincidence that in the last couple of years the average THC percentage listed
has risen from 8 to 10% to 19 to 20%. There hasn’t been such a massive leap forward
in growing methods that we should expect the average THC level to have almost dou-
bled within a decade!
   Whatever your thoughts on the THC debate, it’s important to remember that re-
gardless of a strain’s potency, there are many other factors that make a good smoke;
taste, effects, flavor and smoothness to name just a few. Don’t believe everything you
read; believe what you smoke!
   On that note, I present you with Cannabis Indica: the only strain guide to feature
100 original strains from 100 different breeders from around the world, with high qual-
ity full-color photos to match. This is probably the book I’m most proud of, and I’ll be
forever indebted to the wonderful breeders, seed companies, growers and cannabis
lovers featured within these pages whose patience and generosity have made this
book the fantastic resource that it is.
   No matter what your place is within the cannabis community, whether you’re plan-
ning to smoke your way through the whole book, flick around and find the strains you
love most or have it as a slightly edgy coffee table conversation-starter, I hope that
you enjoy it as much as I do.

Introduction

Cannabis Indica:
What is it exactly?
By Greg Green



While those of us who regularly puff on a nice stoney joint while strolling through our
vast grow rooms may consider indica to be a very good friend, the truth is that an ex-
planation as to what Cannabis indica actually is might be useful for others. And where
better to start than the origins of life itself?
   In all living things genes are shuffled into diverse combinations through a process
of cell division known as meiosis. In sexually reproducing organisms, male and female
genes come together like the two sides of a zipper to produce offspring with a mix of
the parents’ individual characteristics; this occurs because genes are chains of DNA
that are transcribed by cell machinery and ultimately translated into proteins that are
then assembled into a living thing. This process is ongoing throughout the lives of
most organisms and cannabis is no exception.
   Cannabis genes are usually expressed in the form of plant morphology and phys-
iology. While genes primarily control plant characteristics, the environment can impact
how those genes are expressed; the phenotype is the expressed gene. So, the two
things that fundamentally control a plant’s phenotype are its genetics and how its
genes react to the environment. Cannabis is a plant population that consists of shifting
values, and these values are cannabis genes that are expressed as phenotypes.
   Shifting values of cannabis genes can be seen when one looks through the pages
of this book. Here, there are many obvious differences between plants as well as a
lot of common traits. Individual plants can be grouped together based on similarities.
Usually plants derived from a parent stock tend to resemble the parents because their

Introduction
  genes are similar; in fact, modern genetics uses molecular sequencing to group rela-
  tionships between living things based on genetic similarities.
     Domesticated varieties of cannabis plants are known as strains, and this is the
  type of grouping that breeders refer to when they talk about their specific stock lines.
  There are many strains out there, but all can be grouped into three distinct types – or
  more formally ‘species’. The two main types, those that you are most likely to hear
  about, are Cannabis indica and Cannabis sativa. The third, more enigmatic type, is
  Cannabis ruderalis.
     It is clear that indica and sativa both evolved from a common ancestor. Less clear
  is which type is genetically closer to that common ancestor, as there is not enough
  data on this topic. Also, while there is no denying that Cannabis sativa and Cannabis
  indica do differ, there is some debate as to whether there is sufficient deviation and
  separation of sativa and indica to support their distinction as different species. On the
  one hand, they are geographically isolated from each other in the wild, but, like some
  of Darwin’s species of finches on the Galapagos Islands, sativa, indica, and ruderalis
  can hybridize to produce fertile offspring. We don’t have to debate taxonomy here;
  suffice it to say that knowing the difference between sativa, indica and ruderalis is an
  absolutely essential criterion for the cannabis cultivator who wishes to interbreed the
  species.
     Let us first address the characteristics of ruderalis. Unlike the other cannabis
  species it auto-flowers, meaning that it’s flowering phase is triggered by plant maturity
  rather than by the photoperiod. The vast majority of cultivators do not grow ruderalis
  because it has limited psychoactive properties, though newer hybrid breeds of
  cannabis have harnessed its auto-flowering trait to great effect. A more popular
  choice, indica does not auto-flower but is responsive to a photoperiod, as is sativa.
  The most obvious difference between indica and sativa is average height; indica
  plants are much shorter than sativa plants, which can be described as ‘squat’ by com-
  parison. Another distinctive set of features is leaf attributes; indica leaves are short
  and stubby, much like the overall shape of the plant, while sativa plants tend to have
  more leaf blades that are narrower and longer, as well as longer internodes or dis-
  tances between branches. In addition, indica grows much more quickly than sativa
  and has a more rapid flowering time. It is the combination of these traits that makes
  indica especially popular with indoor growers. Indica plants are generally more com-
  pact because genetically their internodes are much shorter than sativa internodes.


       Cannabis Indica The Essential Guide to the World’s Finest Marijuana Strains
                                             xiv
There is no one best way to grow indica plants but, because they grow compactly,
their strength is in numbers per square foot. Whether you’re working with a basement
or closet grow, or a SOG or ScrOG setup, more indica plants can be utilized per
square foot than sativa plants.
   Indica often appears as a landrace. A landrace is a cultivar that hasn’t been par-
ticularly domesticated or bred, containing many of its wild counterpart’s traits. In truth,
while indica has not been influenced much by modern humans, it is being used and
cared for and so is not strictly ‘wild’ either. While some pure indica strains currently
used for breeding purposes probably originated as landraces, once a landrace is hy-
bridized it ceases to be a landrace and is on the path toward becoming a domesti-
cated strain because the hybrid population includes domesticated genes.
   Knowing all this is essential to a cannabis cultivator, but in order to grasp what
truly sets indica apart from the other types, we must understand that cannabis is a
truly extraordinary plant not just because of the way it grows, but because of its unique
relationship with human beings. The human body actually contains receptors that ap-
pear to respond to the cannabinoids contained in cannabis exclusively. The best ex-
planation for this is that, at some point in our evolutionary past, these receptors were
used for a specific purpose but that, since then, cannabis has coopted them in exap-
tation, coevolving with humans to produce a complex symbiotic adaptation.
   What sets indica apart is the way in which its cannabinoids interact with these re-
ceptors; in other words, the type of high that they induce. Indica plants produce what
is known as a couch lock stone as compared with the more cerebral buzz associated
with sativas. This means that the effect of an indica smoke is felt predominantly in
the body, with stronger strains leaving you unwilling or unable to move from your lo-
cation, which is likely the couch. In other words, the cannabinoid content in indica-
based strains induces a more physical than heady response.
   Indica’s intensely physical effect and growing traits are at the root of the species’
prominence in indoor cultivation over the last 40 years. While the appearance of indica
in Western culture is probably a later event than that of sativa, its relative popularity
has grown exponentially since the 70s. It appears to have replaced sativa in most in-
door grow operations in the late 70s and especially the 80s onwards.
   Arguably the most well-known modern indica by reputation is the infamous G-13
or the Hash Plant, but the true indica has to be Afghani#1, which is very popular not
only as a standalone indica but as a breeding base for many other indica based hy-


     Cannabis Indica The Essential Guide to the World’s Finest Marijuana Strains
                                            xv
Introduction
brids. If you come across any indica strains, chances are that Afghani#1 genes are
in there somewhere. The strain known simply as Afghani has been said to be more
Afghan than Afghani#1, and if you are breeding for indica then finding this strain is a
good idea. Kush strains are also very popular and similar to Afghani, and these are
both major players in the beginners’ market. They produce resilient, hardy plants with
reliable genetics and results that are usually impressive. Kush and Afghani strains
are much admired by breeders, and Skunk x Afghani crosses in particular are very
popular. Basically, Afghani can be considered the pioneer of indica plants. Other pop-
ular pure indica varieties worth noting are White Russian (Serious Seeds), Sensi Star
(Paradise Seeds), Matanuska Tundra (Sagarmatha), Master Kush (White Label),
Lowryder (High Bred Seeds), Kong (Holy Smoke Seeds), Deep Purple (Subcool/TGA)
and Blueberry (DJ Short).
   These days, the trend in breeding indica is to hybridize it to create strains that are
known as indica-dominant. Due to the presence of other genetics, usually sativa
genes, strains that are indica-dominant or ‘mostly indica’ tend to be taller than pure
indica strains but also bring more of a cerebral high along with the couch lock effect.
Because of this, pure indica hybrids that incorporate some sativa traits are extremely
popular.
   The term ‘mostly’ used in conjuction with indica has a wide range of meanings but
usually, if a strain is labeled mostly indica, it means that more than half of the plant’s
traits resemble indica. It is normally the type of high and the plant’s growth pattern
that are noticeably indica; it would be unusual find a strain advertised as mostly indica
that dealt a head high instead of a couch lock stone effect.
   If you need to determine the species of your cannabis plants, consulting the strain
description is also important, as some breeders have been able to create strains with
considerable cerebral highs and label them as mostly indica. If the strain is unknown,
visual inspection for leaf type and plant size is a good telltale sign. Do not use intern-
ode lengths as a way to judge strain type as growing conditions influence these con-
siderably. If you’re trying to work out which type of buds you just bought, sampling is
also a good (and enjoyable) way to judge whether your stash is indica or sativa. An-
other indicator may be the size of the bud itself, as sativa colas and bud sites tend to
be smaller; however, there are small sites on indica plants too so the size of the bud
cannot be used alone to determine type. Simply sampling more sativa and indica can
help you determine which type you are looking at, but, again, this will not always be

Introduction
  foolproof. The thought of experimenting with all these traits like a ‘Pepsi challenge’
  is, however, quite alluring.
     An interesting point about indica and mostly indica strains is the way in which they
  are named. While there is no true pattern, they tend to have more memorable names
  than pure indica strains. Black Domina, Maple Leaf, Shiva Shanti, Master Kush,
  Chronic and Blueberry are all good examples of this. Other popular mostly indica
  strains include Shiesel (Bonguru Seeds), P-91 (Stoney Girl Gardens), Kushdee (ASG
  Seeds), Caramel (Poor White Farmer Seeds), Burmese Kush (TH Seeds), Blue Mistic
  (Royal Queen Seeds), and Adonai Kush (Kushman Massive Seed Co.).
     Ultimately, if your goal is to breed indica, I would recommend sticking to the
  Afghani, Hash Plant and Kush lines to be assured of indica-dominant genetics. Many
  of these lines do have some sativa influence so be aware that one is rarely ever work-
  ing with purely indica genetics. However, by selective breeding over generations, most
  sativa influence can be diminished. Some breeders have opted to create colorful and
  creative indica-sativa hybrids
     Every breeder’s goal, regardless of what cannabis variety they’re working with,
  should be to create something that makes an impact. To this end, the most important
  thing a breeder can do is to keep their strain on the market for as long as possible.
  Strains come and go, but a lengthy duration will eventually bring a strain into the
  minds of the cannabis community and keep it there. Many strains that are very pop-
  ular, and some within these pages, have a 20+ year history with the Western com-
  mercial seedbank scene. I believe it is this that offers someone who is interested in
  breeding indica the best possible way of achieving success. The longer you breed,
  market, improve and sell that strain, the better your chances of going down into the
  history books. You should also consider that the person who goes back to Afghanistan
  to find an even better template for indica genetics, to go in and look at large popula-
  tions, to find that extra nice plant that is better than all rest would forever been known
  as an indica maverick. Perhaps that maverick could be you.

The Strains
Adonai Kush
 Kyle Kushman and Shiloh Massive are the guys at the centre of the new wave of
 Earth-friendly styles of cannabis growing and, to this end, produce plant-based nutri-
 ents and growing techniques based on ‘living systems’. For this strain, breeder Shiloh
 Massive has crossed his beloved Russian Kush plant with Silvertooth, which itself is
 a hybrid of Super Silver Haze and Sweet Tooth #3. This offspring has been inbred to
 the f6 generation and has been fully stabilized.
    Adonai Kush has an impressive genetic back list, which makes it a remarkably fun
 and interesting plant to cultivate. Because of the Super Silver Haze and Sweet Tooth
 #3 background via Silvertooth, this plant really yields an enormous amount of bud for
 an indica-dominant. The big buds of Adonai Kush prefer a dryer finishing time to prevent
 mold from developing. Similarly, because of the high yield and heavy flowers, be sure
 to stake these plants well, especially if growing outdoors in a windy location. The sturdy
 Russian Kush genetics provide a lot of toughness and reliability to the plant, so Adonai

Afghani Milk
 Afghani Milk is a solid strain stemming from the Ch9 Female Seeds breeding program.
 Ch9 Vintage 2006, a powerfully bred plant comprised of Afghani, Power Plant and
 Jack Herer genetics, has been bred to an extremely fast growing Mazar-i-Sharif hybrid
 that was an underground hit in Holland several years ago. The Northern Afghani ge-
 netics really shine through, and the white trichomes common to Mazari plants are
 definitely visible.
    The high resin production of Afghani Milk plants means that they are extremely
 sticky when in flower, so be careful when handling. The structure is short, and the plant
 grows quickly, making it ideal for beginners trying out a closet operation for the first
 time, as well as anyone needing to keep their grow on the down low, literally as well
 as figuratively. As with any fast-growing plant you should ensure that the growth doesn’t
 run away with itself; make sure the plants don’t succumb to pest problems in the hidden
 depths of the lower branches or grow too close to your lights. Keep the lights in your
                               grown room at least 8 to 10 inches away from the tips of
  Ch9 Female Seeds,            your plants, or they can burn. These plants do grow well
  Europe                       under LEDs, so if you’re wanting to have a foray into the
  Indica-Dominant              newer lighting world, and want to avoid the problems of
  Genetics: Ch9 Vintage        high electricity bills and light burn on your crop, try these
  2006 x Mazar-i-Sharif        under an LED set up. This does involve a high initial cost
  Potency: THC 18-22%          for the lights themselves, but if you’re interested in mov-
  ch9femaleseeds.com           ing forward in your growing techniques it could be worth-
                               while. The sight of the resin on these plants underneath
 an LED light is enough to make any stoner smile, so try it if you get the chance.
    If the buds become too heavy for the branches to properly support them, you can
 use stakes or netting to secure them, which is within reach of decent light. Expect a
 yield of about 65 to 70 grams if you operate on a vegetative state of 35 to 45 days,
 and a flowering time of 7 weeks.
    A very tangy, hashy taste and smell erupts from this resinous beauty. Depending
 on the amount smoked, and your own state before you smoke it, the effect can be
 near-narcotic in its high which is fast working and lingering, though couch lock doesn’t
 creep up. I’ve heard a lot of medical patients comment on this plant’s ability to relieve
 stomach pain and alleviate spasms from multiple sclerosis. Medical patients can
 smoke this plant safely and be productive in their daily lives as the high is not overly
 heavy or lethargic but rather a head buzz with some mildly energetic cerebral effects.

Afghanica
 The award for Best Company Name has to go to Holland’s The Flying Dutchmen, as
 they’ve managed to reference nautical folklore and find not only a nod to their home
 country but also a neat reference to ‘flying’ high. Such a name is perfect for this great
 company that has been in business since 1998 in Amsterdam. The quality of the ‘true
 breeding’ strains that it took as its genetic foundation means that the Flying Dutchmen
 are very highly thought of in the scene, and rightly so. With their original strain Afghan-
 ica, the company has taken the famously hardy Afghan indica and introduced it to
 Skunk, one of the most famous cannabis strains of all time. Considering that ‘The
 Pure’ strain, also from the Flying Dutchmen, is said to actually be Skunk #1, the plant
 could very well be cannabis royalty!
    The typical rugged, sturdy constitution of the Afghani plant is not lost in this mix,
 which should be among the easiest available strains to grow. If your budget and
 space is low, this is a great single plant to have in a small soil-based closet grow,
                                but she is also a fantastic choice for both SOG and
  Flying Dutchmen,              ScOG set ups. If you are looking to move into organic
  Holland                       or veganics (plant-based) growing, perhaps choosing
  Indica-Dominant               this strain for your first chemical-free crop would be a
  Genetics: Afghani x Skunk     good move; it’s hardy enough to act as a test subject
  Potency: THC 18%              while still producing and not wasting your time. Though
  flyingdutchmen.com            you should not let the plant’s apparent invincibility lead
                                to complacency, it will be resistant to some of the usual
 problems, especially stress and a few of the less intense diseases. Whatever your
 set up, pests could still be a major issue, so be sure to check all over your short,
 dense plants whenever you can. The Skunk genes come through in the form of in-
 creased growing speed and a greater yield than you would get from the Afghani
 alone, and the buds will be tightly packed and very solid. Remember, this plant is
 very problem-free, but you still need a well-ventilated grow room because mold is
 every grower’s worst nightmare.
    The classic Afghani heritage is clearly evident in this strain. You will recognize and
 love the thick, greasy but sweet taste almost instantly. For a heavy smoke, though,
 it’s relatively smooth, and tends towards a taste of hash if used with a vaporizer. The
 high won’t hit you instantly, but when it does, you’ll know about it. The Skunk influence
 in this hybrid gives a strong, mellow high that you will feel throughout your whole body,
 and might leave you feeling a lot heavier than you usually do!

Afgoo
 The USA-based Northstone Organics is a medical cannabis farm that also grows or-
 ganic fresh produce and employs sustainable practices; proof of their genuine care
 for both the quality of their cannabis plants and their impact on the environment. For
 the fantastically-named Afgoo, they’ve mated an Afghani Kush with a Maui Haze, a
 sativa-dominant plant from the shores of Hawaii, and come up with an offspring that’s
 quite the pleasant grow and an even better smoke.
    Afgoo plants display the usual small stature of indica influence and very wide
 leaves, with some enormous fan leaves during vegetation. The leaf-to-calyx ratio can
 be high on some plants, but after harvest the trim is great for hash making and pro-
 duction of medical edibles. They have a high tolerance for nutrients and will thank
 you for a good feed with a growth spurt, but also you need to also make sure that
 they have sufficient access to good light sources.
    This is a very sedative strain, which calms and relaxes both the body and the mind.
                              The smoke can be a bit coughey, but is worth it just for the
  Northstone Organics,        sweet, piney, warm taste alone. It works predominantly on

Atomic Northern Lights
 Atomic Northern Lights is Canadian breeder Dr. Atomic’s version of the classic North-
 ern Lights #5. He has preserved this celebrated plant through a selective breeding
 process, keeping it mostly indica but with a 14 to 20% sativa component that provides
 the lingering and prolonged high. Originally, Northern Lights #5 was bred for vigorous
 growth, great yield and long lasting effects. Dr. Atomic has created a connoisseur
 grower and breeder’s dream plant by preserving and improving upon these classic
 characteristics.
    Atomic Northern Lights is an indoor strain that grows as a short, bushy plant, mak-
 ing it ideal for closet grows. The buds tend to have a frosted look because of the co-
 pious trichomes, and when this plant is happy its fan leaves will curl upwards, as in
 the photo. The plant has a short and stocky structure, which means it is easy to grow
 indoors and remain discreet about things. Flowering time for Atomic Northern Lights
 is about 8 weeks and yield is up to 125 grams per plant.
                                 The prolonged, intense high that accompanies smok-

Auto Bud
 Auto Bud by Autofem Seeds is a cross breed from a Lowryder x Big Bud male, which
 provides the auto-flowering genetics, and a Hindustani female known for her beautiful
 colors and extremely dense yields. This plant is heavily influenced by William’s Won-
 der (from the Lowryder genetics) and subsequently produces very dense, resinous
 buds. By utilizing Lowryder and Big Bud genetics, Autofem Seeds has very cleverly
 created a plant with the positive characteristics of three of the greatest indicas ever
 created: Big Bud, William’s Wonder, and, of course, Northern Lights #2.
    This plant is an auto-flowering variety, again due to the Lowryder genetics, and
 can be planted and harvested in a 60 to 70 day cycle with no change of lighting. Indoor
 growers can expect a harvest of 55 grams if they use 12 to 20 liter pots, 600-watt
 lamps and put the plants under 20 hours of light per day. This strain has been used
 industrially to great effect, but is also great for small, manageable closet growing.
    Auto Bud nugs give a very enjoyable indica stone with a lot of Big Bud flavors and
                               a strawberry smell. Potency is high, and the stone com-

Auto White Domina
 Kannabia, one of the first Spanish seed banks, has been breeding for a number of
 years and currently offers a variety of original seeds, including many auto-flowering
 strains. To create this Auto White Domina, the team at Kannabia crossed the requisite
 ruderalis with a White version of the selectively-bred Black Domina, which itself has
 Afghani, Canadian Ortega and Northern Lights heritage with a big dose of Hash ge-
 netics. Black Domina has become a very popular strain since its inception, and its
 White sister should do likewise due to its straightforward and reliable growth.
                                  A tall ruderalis parent brings an unlikely height to this
                               plant, which thrives particularly well in a SOG set up.
                               Despite having a heavy indica dominance, Auto White
                               Domina will look different to all the others in your set up
                               and should be treated accordingly. A big central cola is
                               surrounded by lateral branches and will take up as much
                               space as you give it. While indoors, the plant will only
  Kannabia Seeds, Spain        normally reach around 3 feet in height, if you have the
  Indica-Dominant              space to grow her outside you’ll find yourself face to face
  Genetics: Ruderalis x        with a 6.5 foot monster. If you’re planning to clone your
  Black Domina                 White Domina, this can be done 3 weeks from seed, and
  Potency: THC 20%             it might be a good idea to top the plants, making them
  kannabia.es                  bushier and with more sites to clone from. A breeder’s
                               tip with regard to cloning is to take cuts 20 minutes after
 watering. Within 7 weeks these plants can be harvested, with a slightly higher rate of
 production if you can leave them a little longer. Either way you’ll get a good amount
 of resin and a lot of pointed, compact buds. Even an indoor grow will yield around
 400 grams per square yard of grow space. The plant is mold resistant and doesn’t
 usually become the victim of the typical weed diseases. If you’re located in a Mediter-
 ranean climate try an outdoor grow, which should be ready to go around the start of
 September thanks to the enhanced growth speed that the bigger root expansion al-
 lows for. In either circumstance, pruning the lower branches will concentrate the
 plant’s energies into making that huge central bud even bigger.
    You’ll recognize the Afghan taste straight away, but the hint of citrus might surprise
 you. They call this strain an “almost devastator”: the high is somewhat incapacitating,
 though bearable and even pleasant if your immediate plans don’t involve a lot of mov-
 ing around or operating heavy machinery.

Babylonia Fruit
 Vulkania Seeds is a popular Spanish seed company based in the Canary Islands.
 Their Babylonia Fruit is an indica-dominant hybrid coming from a Nepalese landrace
 plant bred with African and Asian strains to create a hybrid renowned for its potency,
 yield and outstanding flavor. Cannabis enthusiasts have long known about the incred-
 ible genetic potential of Nepalese ganja, and Babylonia Fruit is a perfect example.
    These plants are incredibly small and have minimal branching. This makes them
 not only ideal for an indoor grow if you’re tight on space, but means they will flourish
 especially well in a SOG set up. Though they can be grown anywhere, indoors is their
 optimal environment and, with maturation at around 7 weeks, you can expect flower-
 ing to occur between 55 and 65 days from germination. This makes Babylonia Fruit
 a great choice for those short on time as well as space. The ease of growing this plant
 also means that even a beginner would have difficulty ruining a crop. However, if you
 choose not to use a SOG technique, be sure to leave your plant in the vegetative
                                 stage for a fair amount of time to allow for maximum
  Vulkania Seeds, Spain          growth. Even a simple organic soil grow can be suitable
  Indica-Dominant                for these plants and, with the right organic nutrients, they
  Genetics: Nepalese             will grow perfectly and look utterly beautiful. Be extra

  Potency: THC 16%               of your grow time, as nasty little critters such as aphids
  vulkaniaseeds.com              can take hold of and ruin your whole crop if you are not
                                 vigilant. If you do find any of these pests, there are myr-
 iad options to help you get rid of them. As ever, an ounce of prevention is worth a
 pound of cure. The plants will never grow tall but they will grow wide and bushy, and
 it is then that harvest is optimized and your patience pays off. If you choose to grow
 outside, the extra space to stretch out will do them well and the increased room for
 roots will definitely help their vigor.
    These buds may smell as sweet as sugar and even fruity when growing, but don’t
 let this fool you into thinking that this is an easy smoke for the newly initiated. The re-
 sulting high from Babylonia Fruit is almost narcotic and surprising in its intensity. Med-
 ical marijuana users find this a great strain to help ease chronic pain and anxiety and
 to induce sleep in those who’ve been suffering from insomnia, making it popular
 amongst that community. Of course, its effects are also much appreciated by the
 recreational user and every true stoner will love the heavy and long-lasting hit of this
 one, so roll up a J, lean back and enjoy!

Big Buddha Cheese
 This Cheese from Big Buddha Seeds is a unique strain that was, until recently, only
 available as a clone. Cheese originated in the late 80s as one unique female pheno-
 type from Skunk #1 seeds grown somewhere in the Chiltern Hills. This plant produced
 huge buds and had an incredible cheddar-like odor, and was cloned to become
 Cheese. Big Buddha bred this UK Cheese backcross with a pure Afghani male plant
 to create Big Buddha Cheese, one of the most popular strains in the UK.
    Big Buddha spent two years selectively backcrossing this plant in order to isolate spe-
 cific beloved Cheese traits, and now Big Buddha Cheese retains its mother’s old school
 taste and its Afghani father’s sturdiness and excellent yields. The flowering time should
 be 7 to 9 weeks indoors, and you can look to harvest at the end of October outdoors. Be-
 cause of the high yield, additional support is often necessary, so be sure to stake your
 plants well in advance of flowering. You will need very good air filtration in your grow room
 because the aroma is so pungent that it can draw unnecessary attention to your garden.
                                    The high is very uplifting with no ceiling, and offers a

 Bubble Gum comprises Colombian sativa, Afghan indica and Jamaican genetics to
 create a phenomenal plant. The Bubble Gum genetics bring stability and a sweet
 aroma to these plants and were bred with Bigger Pine, one of the Original Sensible
 Seed’s best-bred plants. Bigger Pine was created from inbred lines of Big Bud and
 Super Skunk and was chosen for breeding due to its high yield and potency.
                                 These plants are short and bushy, with little spread
                              and a strong structure, and you’ll see the influence of

 Denver’s Karmaceuticals LLC are a cannabis collective with over 110 varieties on
 their shelves as well as every sort of marijuana-related paraphernalia you could care
 to think of. We can hardly accuse them of being crude with Blue Donkey Dick, as the
 name more or less writes itself; its parents are DJ Short’s superstrain Blueberry and
 the brilliant indica-heavy hybrid Donkey Dick from Mighty Mite Seeds. Donkey Dick
 is interesting as it comes from Vancouver Island originally and is meant for outdoor
 growing, which is a relatively rare combination on the seed market.
                                                    Donkey Dick is so called for the enor-

                                                 spring. As Blueberry too is known to be a
                                                 large producer, you can expect a heavy
                                                 yield from this plant, and one that shares
                                                 the beauty of the rest of the Blue family,
  Karmaceuticals LLC, USA                        with the purple and blue tints being en-
  Indica-Dominant                                hanced by cold temperatures. The plant
  Genetics: Blueberry x Donkey Dick              is very rigid, making it fairly hard to train,
  Potency: THC 17%                               but this shouldn’t be necessary, as the
  facebook.com/karmaceuticals                    ruggedness of the plant means that it is
                                                 able to hold its own weight well. As this
 strain is well-suited for commercial grows, you should be aware of having enough
 water and light available to ensure that your harvest will be as profitable as possible
 as well as of the highest quality. Also be sure to amend the soil before you plant these
 guys outside, as making sure that you have a good quality soil base will make a world
 of difference to the growing potential of your crop. If you’re growing in the U.S. mid-
 west, this particularly applies to you, because if you’re within 10 miles of a river basin
 the soil will probably be too alkaline and will need something like elemental sulfur or
 sphagnum peat added to it. As organic grows are purported to enhance the pot’s
 flavor and potency, you could also aim to bring out the very best of this strain’s Blue
 traits by staying chemical-free throughout its growth, if you so wish.
    The cured buds of your Blue Donkey Dick plants should be purple in hue and fairly
 dense. Like its parents, this plant gives an uplifting and positive high along with a
 fruity smoke that is also a little skunky. This high is extremely long-lasting, so you
 should only need a few tokes to carry you through the whole night.

 Dinafem Seeds of Spain has been in the business for almost a decade and in that
 time has risen to be one of the country’s largest seed banks. Their fantastic Blue Fruit
 strain can be traced back to the mountains of Oregon, with a family tree that includes
 a purple Mexican, a Thai sativa plant and a particularly high-yielding variety of DJ
 Short’s fantastic Blueberry.
    Most Blue Fruit plants are vigorous in growth and may need to be trained or con-
 trolled if grown in environments where less space is available, such as indoor set ups
 or smaller greenhouses. Thanks to the sativa influence, they grow taller than some in-
 dica hybrids. It’s better to keep the light levels down with this strain, as too much light
 can stress the plants and cause mutation. As with all Blue strains, colder environments
 will bring out the delightful blue / purple coloring on the leaves, which compliments the
 sweet berry taste of this plant perfectly. Your plant will look good enough to eat!
    There’s no need to go that far though, as the intense and affecting red berry taste of
                                 the smoke will be more than enough, lingering as it does
  Dinafem Seeds, Spain           on the palate for a long while. As you slide into a psychoac-
  Indica-Dominant                tive but calming body and head high, your senses will be

Blue Mistic
 After numerous years growing in the Netherlands, the team behind Royal Queen
 Seeds decided that the time had come to exercise 20 years’ worth of knowledge
 and produce their own varieties of cannabis that were suitable for all growers,
 from the absolute beginner to the connoisseur breeder. Since inception, Royal
 Queen Seeds has won many accolades for its products and Blue Mistic is one of
 the company’s most enigmatic strains. Though both its name and growing pattern
 suggest that DJ Short’s famous Blueberry strain might be found somewhere in its
 family tree, we can only be sure that its roots lie in the fantastic surroundings of
 the California hills.
    As with most indica-dominant hybrids, Blue Mistic is a compact plant that doesn’t
 need a lot of space to grow to its potential. It makes a fantastic indoor plant, but will
 also thrive outdoors in most climates, though its favorite environment is one similar
 to that of its native Northern Cali. Indoors or in greenhouses, Blue Mistic can grow a
                               little larger than other indicas, but should never grow be-
  Royal Queen Seeds,           yond 5 feet, making it suitable for a variety of growing
  Holland                      situations. They do, however, tend to prefer growing in
  Indica-Dominant              small groups of similar plants, and seem to encourage
  Potency: THC 20%             each other in the growing process!
  royalqueenseeds.com             These hardy plants will finish in just over 9 weeks,
                               but the most exciting part of the growing process will
 come a few weeks before that. Half way through their flowering cycle, the flowers will
 start to show a stunning blue hue, beginning fairly pale and moving through to a
 deeper, more sensual tone when harvest nears. The fabulous-looking buds will grow
 denser and more resinous right before your eyes, and such is the beauty of the plant
 that you’ll barely even notice how much bud she’s carrying. A good harvest should
 give you about 450 grams of dried bud, which is a superb rate of production for such
 a small plant. She also has the added bonus of barely giving off any aromas in the
 flowering stage, which negates the need for excessive venting and protects you from
 the noses of any snitch neighbors.
    The buds of all Blue strains enjoy a longer-than-average curing time to really en-
 hance their already fantastic flavor and smell, so if you can keep your hands off your
 stash you’ll be rewarded well in the end. Fruity and sweet, the smoke is light and
 smooth but carries with it a knock out stone that will leave you feeling like you’ve been
 run over with a padded furry blue truck. And I mean that in the best possible way.

Blue North Special
 North of Seeds is quickly gaining a very solid reputation in the competitive Spanish
 seed market. Operating out of the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, this company
 was the first medical seed bank established in that area, and the team goes to great
 lengths with the care of their seeds. Typical to all ‘Blue’ strains, Blue North Special is
 a mostly-indica plant that shares the parentage of eminent breeder DJ Short’s Afghani
 Blueberry, but also has in its heritage Beast, a strain which is popular throughout Spain.
    Blue North Special can be grown both indoors and outdoors, and thanks to its
 mildew-resistant properties, it can flourish happily in either environment without too
 much trouble. If you choose to grow indoors and use a 12 on/12 off light cycle, you
 can expect flowering to occur at around the 50 to 60 day mark with about 400 grams
 per square yard being harvested. If a bigger yield is your main concern, then growing
 this strain outdoors may be a good option, as the yield can be boosted by up to 100
 grams when grown outside. However, if you choose to go outdoor, pests can some-
                               times be a problem, from the usual aphids and ladybug
  North of Seeds, Spain        visitors to any animals native to your area, including
  Indica-Dominant              nosy neighbors and dope thieves. If you can keep all
  Genetics: Blue x Beast       these at bay, perhaps with an arsenal of organic or
  Potency: THC 14-18%          chemical pesticides and strange behavior that makes
  northofseeds.com             people voluntarily stay away from your property, expect
                               to harvest around mid-October. This plant displays its
 Blue family traits in its density and stout shape and in its red, purple and, of course,
 blue hues that not only make it an enjoyable plant to grow, but also beautiful to behold!
 As always, because of the Blue family’s Afghani roots, this plant likes dry conditions
 and is great for hash-making. It is a true blue, meaning that it is blue-colored no matter
 what the weather, but, again as with many cannabis plants, it changes color in colder
 temperatures. This means that if you like to manipulate your plant colors to make your
 garden more gorgeous and to give your dope more bag appeal, give it a shot and
 lower grow room temperature during the last few weeks of flowering!
    Once harvested, the bud has a very strong smell of berries and when you roll up
 your first joint, you’ll notice that the sweetness of the smoke lingers pleasantly on your
 palate. Much like parent strain Blueberry, this strain packs a long-lasting high with a
 very positive spin, great for socializing and watching a movie that would otherwise
 suck. A delicious smoke for sure, and the accompanying euphoria makes for an in-
 spirational experience.

Blue Rhino
 Positronics is a well-respected seed company that operates out of Spain. It produces
 a variety of fantastic strains, including the formidable Blue Rhino, a great cross be-
 tween the ever popular indica classic Blueberry and White Rhino, a strain that is said
 to be almost narcotic in its high. These were bred with the intent of creating a sort of
 ‘super strain’ exhibiting all the qualities that a grower could want. To ensure that only
 the best genes were used, Positronics used an original Blue female from British Co-
 lumbia famed for its sensory traits, as well as a high quality Rhino hybrid of Afghan,
 Brazilian and Indian ancestry.
    As such, Blue Rhino plants have a huge central cola, massive leaves, and an
 aroma that is pure indica. It needs a lot of space to grow, whether that means a good-
 sized pot indoors or a nice bit of space in a greenhouse, but to really let this plant
 stretch its legs and fulfill its promising potential, it needs to be grown outdoors. With
 the White Rhino mother it can make a great choice for an outdoor commercial grow,
                               but as ever, keep your eye on security at all times. These
  Positronic Seeds, Spain      plants won’t grow very tall, as they are mostly indica,
  Indica-Dominant              and won’t produce many leaves, meaning the buds will
  Genetics: Blueberry x        be nice and dank. The branches, however, are very
  White Rhino                  dense, so don’t be worried about the lack of space be-
  Potency: THC 16%             tween the nodes as it has enough strength to hold the
  positronicseeds.com          big buds it will produce. If you’re really paranoid about
                               it, you can use stakes to give an additional bit of support
 to your heavily-laden girls, but this shouldn’t really be necessary. Don’t be tempted to
 harvest early or you’ll miss the best part of the flowering stage – your buds will puff
 up in size and density right around the 9 week mark, increasing your yield substan-
 tially. The extra time is also said to give a more mature and layered taste to the har-
 vested buds.
    Though the size and strength of your plants are testament to the lengthy genetic
 selection process that the breeders embarked on, only when you light up your first
 joint will you feel the impact of such specialized choices of parent plant. The Blue
 family mother is present in the blueberry and gooseberry aroma and taste, and the
 Rhino father contributes the heavy body feeling and the woody hints. For the first hour
 you’ll get a pleasant buzz, which then slides into a longer lazy feeling. It can be a bit
 scratchy if smoked through a bong but the effects will be even more evident. Don’t
 plan to be doing much after this smoke.

Blueberry
 DJ Short’s Blueberry is possibly the most celebrated indica strain on the planet. Leg-
 ends abound about this plant, and for good reason. Blueberry has been around since
 the late 70s and is known as a large producer of dense bud, as well as being father
 to a hell of a lot of Blue offspring strains. The fantastic Blueberry genetics can be
 found in hundreds of commercially available strains, many of which have become as
 popular as their parent strain, making Blueberry the Bob Marley of the weed world.
    Blueberry plants have a little more stretch than many indica plants and can reach a
 medium-tall height with long side branches. Yield is great because all of these branches
 produce sticky, trichome-laden buds sporting medium to large calyxes, and it can be grown
 indoors or outdoors. Once harvested, Blueberry bud can be stored much longer than most
 strains, and enjoys a long curing process, so feel free to keep it stashed for a while.
    Once your impatience has you reaching for the storage jar you’ll find bud with red,
 purple, and blue hues that have turned lavender in the curing process. The aroma
                               and taste is a fruity reminder of blueberries, and the high
  DJ Short, Canada             is pleasantly euphoric and long-lasting. The stone is so
  Indica-Dominant              potent that even the most well-seasoned of stoners will

Blueberry Headband
 As the name suggests, this hybrid, with 75% indica content, is a cross between the
 classic indica strain, Blueberry, and Headband, known to some as Sour Kush. This fu-
 sion is a product of California’s Emerald Triangle Seeds, a company that specializes
 in revamping traditional cannabis strains. The Emerald Triangle of the name refers to
 the Mendocino, Humboldt and Trinity counties in California, an area that has been pop-
 ular with growers and cannabis connoisseurs for the last 50 years. They have undoubt-
 edly chosen well for this strain in terms of genetics; Blueberry is well known for its
 beautiful blue hues, which it has passed on to its offspring, and Headband counts Sour
 Diesel, OG Kush and, of course, the legendary ChemDawg amongst its ancestors.
    Both parent plants are large producers, which can sometimes mean, in addition
 to a plentiful harvest, a huge plant that can only realistically be grown outdoors. Head-
 band in particular is well known for its furious outward growth that makes it ‘leggy’
 and particularly horrendous to grow inside. However, Emerald Triangle combats this
                                                  by using the strong indica presence of
  Emerald Triangle Seeds, USA                     Blueberry to slim the hybrid down. The re-
  Indica-Dominant                                 sult is that Blueberry Headband plants
  Genetics: Blueberry x Headband                  can actually be grown quite happily in an
  Potency: THC 15-20%                             indoor grow room and even a well-tended
  emeraldtriangleseeds.co.uk                      closet garden. The lankiness of its parent
                                                  strain does mean that the branches may
 struggle under their own weight when it comes to the flowering stage, even with the
 strengthening influence of the indica genes, so it may be necessary to use stakes to
 help support the branches. Just keep an eye out for any drooping near the biggest
 flowers. If you are growing outside, let these guys grow to their full potential and you’ll
 have a gorgeous garden just before harvest. It is interesting to note that the street
 value of this weed is relatively high, due to strong demand for blue bud.
    Headband is especially well-suited for medical marijuana users as the stone is not
 overpowering, leaving you able to go about your daily life, and it controls nausea and
 anxiety well. The high of Blueberry is both euphoric and very long-lasting so, as you
 would guess, crossing the two produces a smoke which is both energetic and apt to
 leave you ludicrously happy and in fits of giggles. It also is a great pain-reliever and
 calms the smoker. The taste is unmistakably Blueberry, but with a light lemon scent
 from the sativa-dominant Headband. Be sure to savor the flavor, scent, and experi-
 ence of this great West Coast plant!

Blush
 Canada’s Whish Seeds are just starting to become more recognized, thanks to strains
 such as Blush, which was released in 2005 and encompasses both Afghani and Thai
 genetics. To create the strain Whish crossed the rare and mysterious Berlin with Dutch
 Passion’s Blue Moonshine, a Blueberry offspring with a rich gene pool.
    Blush grows best in colder climates, and its Blue traits are enhanced even further
 by this kind of temperature, so in a colder set up not only will you get the most out of
                               this strain but you’ll also have a good-looking crop. It
                               isn’t, however, a good choice for SOG, and, being a
                               grassroots sort of plant, favors soil and organic feeding
                               over hydro and excessive chemical nutrients. Powdery
                               mildew should be easily kept at bay, but spider mites are
                               a fan of this plant, so be sure to check for any evidence
                               that they have taken hold. Blush is a good strain to
                               breed from and will yield up to 60 grams indoors.
  Whish Seeds, Canada             Blush is a down-to-earth kind of plant and the
  Indica-Dominant              blue/purple bud has an earthy, natural and almost floral

BLZ Bud
 With BLZ Bud, Holland’s Seedism Seeds have created an extremely potent indica-
 dominant G-13 hybrid. It’s very resilient and sturdy, with a potency to die for, thanks
 to its fantastic parental genetics. Train Wreck is an old school sativa-dominant hybrid
 strain from Arcata in Humboldt County, California that is known to render smokers
 completely witless, and Silver Haze is a very potent sativa-dominant hybrid that brings
 a resin-heavy but uplifting high to smokers worldwide. G-13 is another classic old
 school strain that brings a lot of structural stability and medicinal properties like ap-
 petite stimulation to BLZ Bud.
    This plant has very typical indica growth patterns, so expect large fan leaves and
 very little space between internodes. BLZ Bud is happy to grow in most systems, and
 maintains the potency and flavor of the sativa-dominant hybrids, but mixes them with
 the sturdiness of an indica plant. If your plant is single stemmed, expect one large
 cluster of buds all along the main stem with a few budding side branches.
                                  BLZ Bud smells and tastes sweet, sour and spicy

Buddha’s Sister
 Buddha’s Sister from the celebrated Soma Seeds of Holland was formerly named
 Soma Skunk V+ but was rebranded to better suit her growth patterns and the sublime
 high she delivers. Buddha’s Sister is a sibling of the tall, lanky Siddhartha, but by
 crossing the Reclining Buddha with Afghani Hawaiian, Soma has both increased the
 yield and maintained the sweet taste of the Reclining Buddha plant. Soma’s plants
 prefer organic growing techniques, and are reliable plants for beginners.
    The buds are slippery and silky because of the abundance of greasy resin, mean-
 ing you need to be careful not to touch your plants too much before harvest. Buddha’s
 Sister makes lots of side branches, so unless you are an experienced grower with
 time to meet her extensive needs, it is better to grow her as a multi-branch plant in-
 stead of in a SOG. A soil set up with good doses of plant-based nutes would also do
 fine. Buddha’s Sister has fluffy, loosely packed buds making it mold resistant, and the
 multi-branch stature keeps yield high.
                                  The flavor is like cherry candy and the smell is quite
  Soma Seeds, Holland         tart, rather than sweet. The resinous buds and leaves
  Indica-Dominant             are great for making hash and taste especially good if

Bullshark
 If Hollywood ever makes a movie about a cannabis seed company (and with Arnie
 on the case that might not be too far away) that company will be the Bulldog. It started
 life as an underground smokers’ den, which turned into the first ex-sex-shop cof-
 feeshop in Amsterdam, and now comprises locations in several countries, a hotel,
 and stacks of branded merchandise – a real ‘rags to riches’ story. The Bulldog Seeds
 produces its own strains, such as Bullshark, a hybrid of Green House’s Great White
 Shark and Skunk #5. The award-winning Great White Shark brings Super Skunk,
 South Indian and Brazilian genetics, which result in great yields and a very strong
 body stone, while the Skunk family, hailing from the original indica/sativa mix, needs
 no introduction and brings strength and potency to Bullshark.
    A 70/30 indica/sativa mix, Bullshark is a simple and fast strain that’s suitable for
 growers of all different abilities, from the newest cultivator to the most skilled breeder.
 A double dose of Skunk genetics means that these plants give off the distinctive Skunk
                                aroma, while the indica genetics ensure that they stay
  The Bulldog Seeds,            short and dense through their whole life span. Fat buds
  Holland                       will grow along the main stalk as well as the secondary
  Indica-Dominant               branches, meaning that towards the end of flowering
  Genetics: Great White         you may need to give some extra support to the plant
  Shark x Skunk #5              by staking or netting. Flowering occurs within 8 weeks,
  Potency: THC 17%              and a square yard of grow space will yield between 600
  bulldogseeds.nl               and 700 grams. Outdoors, if you’re growing in the North-
                                ern hemisphere, harvest will be around mid-October.
 When you’re drying these buds, the outside tends to dry faster than the inside and
 will appear to be crisping up after only a couple of days. However, the buds will not
 be properly aired out inside, so resist the temptation and leave them to cure until
 you’re sure that the whole bud is fully dry. If you give in and roll up some wet weed,
 it won’t burn and will leave a bad taste (literally) in your mouth.
    A smooth smoke, Bullshark has the strong body effect and skunky sweet taste of
 its Great White Shark parent. A hint of fruitiness comes through that’s not very no-
 ticeable while the buds are growing, which is probably thanks to the Great White
 Shark parentage. The taste lingers delectably on your palate even as the creeping
 strength of the high takes over your whole body. This heaviness doesn’t tend to go
 away quickly either, so set yourself up for the night with some good entertainment
 and enjoy the feeling.

Burmese Kush
 Netherlands-based TH Seeds have become popular with growers in recent years
 thanks to their hardy and inventive strains that exhibit very favorable traits. For BuKu,
 as this variety is affectionately known, they have crossed a Burmese Kush plant with
 their signature OG Kush family, the Los Angeles strain which has ChemDawg genes
 as well as Lemon Thai and Hindu Kush heritage. This leaves us with a pretty impres-
 sive plant with a fantastic, reliable background.
    A speedy plant that flowers in 7 weeks, BuKu has a very low leaf-to-flower ratio
 making harvest easier and leaving you with more bud for your amount of grow space.
 It will only grow to about 40 inches, but upon harvest you’ll get around 400 grams per
 square yard. For the commercial grower, this can be a fantastic crop for its ease of
 growing and, particularly in a hydroponic set up, its amazing yields.
    The OG Kush influence is certainly apparent in both the flavor and potency of the
 smoke, along with a citrus zest that adds something extra. The dried buds are partic-

Cannaberry
 Cannaberry is a 60/40 indica/sativa hybrid project by U.S.-based cannabis research
 pioneers, Allele Seeds Research. The cross was made using a DNA Genetics Can-
 nalope Haze female, a Sensi Seeds Northern Lights male and a Dutch Passion Blue-
 berry female. This plant has two phenotypes, one that is super sativa head stash, and
 another (pictured here) that grows much like a sativa, but with slightly fuller buds
 thanks to the indica influence.
    Cannalope Haze is a pure sativa from DNA Genetics that flowers in an incredibly
 fast 8 weeks. Mixing this with the pure indica indoor-growing Northern Lights from
 Sensi Seeds resulting creates a very versatile plant that can be grown practically any-
 where. The stability and high yield of the Dutch Passion Blueberry means that this
 plant is a solid all-around performer set to become a big player in the medical

Caramel
 Previously known as Candied Chem, with the name changed to avoid confusion
 with another cross, Caramel comes from the private grow rooms of Poor White
 Farmer Seeds, a single grower based in the USA known for his fair dealings and
 honesty about his genetics. Originating in Oregon in May of 2009, this hybrid is the
 offspring of a 1991 Chemdawg cutting mother and Butterscotch Hawaiian f2 father.
 This produces a plant that is 80-90% indica. It’s difficult to trace its lineage back too
 far, given the mythology that shrouds its Chemdawg mother, but the Butterscotch
 Hawaiian has a strong influence. There are many different phenotypes of this strain
 as yet but each is a joy to grow. When the strain is fully stabilized, it is set to be a
 formidable contender.
    Caramel can grow either indoors or outdoors, but is probably a little happier in-
 doors. You’ll see that the plant grows somewhat like its Chemdawg mother, a little
 viney but not too huge with an average spread of about 1 to 1.5 feet. A SOG set up
                               can take advantage of this trait. The temptation can be
  Poor White Farmer            to overfeed a Caramel but be sure not to succumb or
  Seeds, USA                   you’ll stunt growth and wreck your crop. Also keep an
  Indica-Dominant              eye out for the mites that seem to like this plant and will

  1991 x Butterscotch          dery mildew, on the other hand, will struggle to take hold
  Hawaiian F2                  at all. When harvest time rolls around, which should be
  Potency: THC 17%             up to about 70 days when grown inside, be prepared for
                               a great harvest, and the calyx-to-leaf ratio means that
 trimming is easy and that harvest, as a whole, is relatively stress-free. Just make sure
 you don’t rub your eyes after trimming – you’ll regret it.
    Once flowering begins you’ll notice a distinct smell of butterscotch in your grow
 room, with an unusual hint of rubber alongside it. This smoke is not for the inexperi-
 enced toker and can be worryingly strong. The high can allegedly bring on a mild
 panic attack if you are not mentally prepared for the effects, so be sure to be in a
 comfortable place with good people before you get mashed on this one. The high be-
 gins with a tightness around the eyes, spreading to the rest of your face before melting
 somewhat into the rest of your body, moving to a pretty heavy stone. It leaves you
 feeling noticeably clear in the head and can set you up for some serious giggles. Also
 prepare yourself for some serious munchies – possibly brought on as much from the
 mouth-watering butterscotch smell as by the weed itself!

 Riot Seeds is a seed company from the US, and the home of the fantastic and enig-
 matic Clockwork Orange. Its predecessor, from which it got its name, was either the
 result of a crazy mountain growers’s colchicine project or a mutant bag seed find, de-

 that this was then bred with a G13/Black Widow hybrid from Mr. Nice Seeds to recre-

    If your set up is aeroponic or hydroponic, this strain has the potential to do really
 well for you, though it also grows great in soil. Bear in mind that a SOG set up isn’t
 advisable as the plants grow giant leaves that necessitate a lot of space. An insider
 grow tip is to raise these plants organically for the full flavor and potency explosion.
    You’ll see where the name originally came from when you hold a dried orange/gold
 bud in your hand, and if you can get over its gorgeous good looks, you can enjoy a
 very different woody, earthy taste. You should be ready for a massive stone, however,
                               as this strain can be overwhelming if you’re unprepared.

COG by Kingdom Organic Seeds is affectionately known by those who love her as
COGzilla in reference to her insatiable appetite for root space, water, light and food, as
well as her insane growth rates. COG is a cross between head breeder The Rev’s Cin-
derella 99 line and an old Santa Cruz outdoor favorite that is known as OG Kush but
actually resembles an OG Kush / White Widow hybrid.
   This plant is, as mentioned above, a super-hog for root space, light, water and food.
She prefers to grow in the ground but can also be grown indoors if you build a hefty con-
                              tainer mix and use larger containers than normal. This plant
                              finishes in 8 to 9 weeks and grows very quickly, giving a
                              decent yield. Her branches have been known to snap from

Cogollon Powell
 Dr. Canem & Company Seeds is a breeder’s collective that has been operating since
 1998, out of Spain, where they breed excellent cannabis strains and raise Bull Terriers.
 Cogollon Powell (named after a certain US general) is one of their most interesting
 strains because of the intriguing blend of Big Bud and Afghani genetics. This high-
 yielding trait has been maintained by Dr. Canem and his crew, and the injection of
 Afghani genetics has added some excellent drought-resistance and flavor to the plant.
    This plant is almost industrial in its bud production, especially outdoors, so be sure to
 stake your plants well in advance of flowering. Indoor growers should set up rotating fans
 to encourage stronger stalks and good ventilation for the copious buds. Another option
 is to bounce the young stalks between two fingers gently once or twice a day for half a
 minute or so to mimic the effect of wind on the young plant – this encourages stronger
 and thicker stalk growth, which will come in handy when the heavy buds appear.
    Smokers lucky enough to get hold of this strain should expect a very smooth, pleas-
                                ant smoke that leaves you feeling overwhelmingly happy.

Cream Caramel Auto
 Spain’s Sweet Seeds, as the name might suggest, specializes in producing cannabis
 strains that are sweet, aromatic and tasty. The company has built a very good name
 for itself due to their careful quality assurance methods and excellent germination
 rates. The company is also notable for selling seeds in groups of 3, 5 or 10, which is
 good news for rookie growers wanting to test out their set up or for those who want
 some variation in their grow room but don’t have the room for 100 different plants.
 Cream Caramel Auto is a result of crossing Sweet Seeds’ best auto-flowering plant
 with Cream Caramel, which itself is an interesting hybrid of East Indian BlueBlack,
 Maple Leaf Indica and the famous White Rhino, created with the intention of exploiting
 the vigor of hybrids and bringing uniformity to the offspring.
    Cream Caramel Auto plants are perfect for indoor growing, as their East Indian
 heritage keeps them fairly small and dense, with a large central bud. Unlike some
 auto variations, this plant not only shares the looks of its mother but also the behavior,
                                with the exception that it tends to rush through the veg-

  Indica-Dominant               grow time down to around 70 to 75 days from seed to
  Genetics: East Indian         harvest. As with all auto strains, you need to be very
  BlueBlack x Maple Leaf        much aware of the size of the plant in relation to the size
  Indica x White Rhino          of the pot it is in, and ensure that you transplant into a
  Potency: THC 19%              bigger container as soon as necessary. These plants will
  sweetseeds.es                 begin to flower between 20 and 30 days no matter what
                                their size, so if their growth is stunted by a lack of room
 for the roots to grow, your final harvest will suffer as a result. Near to harvest time the
 plants will emit an earthy aroma and the buds will be literally covered in sticky resin,
 which is great for any grower to see. However, this does mean that you must be care-
 ful not to touch your eyes or face when you’re chopping and to wear gloves to avoid
 an unpleasantly strong contact high. This might sound fun if you’ve already had a
 joint or two, but it isn’t.
    You can be sure that sparking up a Cream Caramel Auto bud will bring you a myr-
 iad of flavorsome sensations. The dried bud has a lovely oregano-like smell and the
 taste of molasses and caramel comes through distinctly upon further inspection. This
 strain also delivers a knock-out punch of a high: a breathtaking space-out stoned sen-
 sation, plus a near dissociative body feeling that must be experienced to be believed.
 Not for the faint of heart!

                     Deep Purple by Subcool is an indica-dominant cross between his Purple Urkle and
                     Querkle strains. Deep Purple was designed to lock down more of the Urkle dominant
                     traits and bring out the musty grape taste that Purple Urkle is famous for. Deep Purple
                     produces a wide range of female plants and not all of them actually produce colors;
                     however, the females that do produce colors are highly prized by connoisseur growers
                     and many consider them to be among the very best indica strains around.
                        Like many indicas, Deep Purple is a short, stocky plant that exhibits fairly slow up-

Deimos
 Deimos is a hybrid from Spain’s celebrated Buddha Seeds. This indica-dominant
 plant represents the culmination of years of breeding over seven generations of
 Northern Lights and Ruderalis plants in order to obtain an auto-flowering plant with
 the classic Northern Lights features that you know and love. Expect a great indoor
 or outdoor plant with a hardy, resilient nature and good lateral branching with a re-
 spectable yield.
    Deimos grows vigorously upwards and outwards creating a bushy and dense yet
 compact plant. Careful breeding has led to a high yielding auto-flowering plant with
 lots of lateral branches that can yield buds as large as the central cola. Growers love
 this plant because of its discreet size – it ranges from 2.5 to 3 feet in height, making
 it suitable for secret indoor and outdoor grows.
    Growers who enjoy continuous harvest set ups will love Deimos as it is a fast
 growing plant that can go from seed to bud in two months and supply smokers with
                               a constant supply of ganja. To get the fastest results
  Buddha Seeds, Spain          from your Deimos plant, you should grow in less than
  Indica-Dominant              eighteen hours of light per day from start to finish. Try
  Genetics: Northern Lights    planting two and then waiting a few weeks and plant-
  x Ruderalis                  ing two more, and then repeating this process as the

                               ing for you at home!
    An important aspect to be aware of when growing Deimos is that, because it is
 such a vigorous plant, it likes to have a light nutrient feed after it has been growing
 for two weeks, but keep it very light as you don’t want to burn the young plant. Once
 flowering begins put the plants on a flowering nutrient regime for weeks four through
 six. Remember that you should flush your plant for two weeks prior to harvest to re-
 move the taste of fertilizers from your bud, so just be careful to schedule your feeding
 and flushing to accommodate the fast finishing time of an auto-flowering strain. Auto-
 flowering strains tend to like root-stimulating nutrients like Phosphorus, but again, be
 sure to flush before harvest as it makes the bud taste cleaner, and only buy fertilizers
 that are “food safe” and suitable for tomatoes or another vegetable-type plant.
    Deimos is a great plant to smoke because of its devastating potency and its classic
 sweet and tangy taste. Many people enjoy this plant to help them relax and think
 things over slowly, and others like to smoke Deimos and watch a movie with friends.

Double Dutch
 Magus Genetics from the Netherlands has been involved in breeding and growing for
 over 20 years and, in this time, has secured access to some fantastic genetics. This
 includes a pre-2000 female Chronic, the product of a Skunk/Northern Lights, AK-47
 and another Northern Lights plant. This plant was crossed with Magus Genetics’ own
 aptly-named Warlock male, which has its roots in Skunk and Afghani indica strains.
 Double Dutch has a lot of indica genetics in her gene pool, but the sativa influences
 are also evident, especially when you go to harvest your giant, super dense buds.
                                  Double Dutch grows with big green leaves, a robust
                               stature and very sturdy stems. Despite its hardiness, this
                               plant must be staked due to the weight of the sativa-like
                               buds, which will grow to epic proportions in the flowering
                               stage and, if exposed to a lot of light, will even start to
                               look like massive popcorn balls. Remember, when stak-

  Holland                      ridiculously fast. You don’t want to risk damaging the
  Indica-Dominant              stalk or branches because you staked your plants a day
  Genetics: Warlock x          late. Similarly, because the buds are very heavy, indoor
  pre-2000 Chronic             grow rooms need to be very well ventilated to avoid the
  Potency: THC 18%             risk of mold developing.
  magusgenetics.com               These crops will grow well in bio, coco and especially
                               well in hydro grow systems, and both topping and train-
 ing can bring out great results. Towards the end of flowering, 1000 watts of light can
 be suitable to optimize bud formation. Placing your lights effectively is enormously
 important because Double Dutch loves direct sunlight. Be sure to plan your grow
 room’s organization in advance to ensure that each and every plant gets enough light,
 and if they do, should expect a great harvest of about 4 to 5 ounces per plant.
    Smoking these popcorn nugs will give you a strong and layered buzz, affecting both
 mind and body. You may recognize the taste as being somewhat similar to Cheese, but
 with a more aromatic aftertaste and lingering flavor. The Double Dutch aroma is a lovely
 wildflower scent with a fruity bouquet. The high comes on after a slight delay, and is
 complex and strong, as well as skunky with a very noticeable but clear impact on the
 head with some heavy body effects, too. Smokers should be aware that the buzz can
 last from two to four hours depending on the smoker’s tolerance level.

Double Fun
 Holland’s No Mercy Supply are serious about providing the best quality cannabis
 strains and growing supplies to the world. Double Fun is their best outdoor plant, but
 being a 75/25 indica/sativa hybrid, its size and stature means it grows happily indoors,
 too. Double Fun was a cross between Citral, a 1993 KC Brains clone not to be con-
 fused with the variety available later on the market, and the legendary but enigmatic
 Dr. Weedman, an early-flowering variety whose genetic history is all but unknown.
    Double Fun is resistant to both mold and fungi, and is a highly stable strain with
 just one phenotype available. Industrial growers love a Double Fun crop’s unifor-
 mity, because it means they can grow fields and fields of Double Fun and accu-
 rately estimate their yield. These results will include fat, extremely resin-covered
 nugs coated with white hairs that will be ready for harvest around 60 days from
 seed. Whether you’re growing indoors or out, you can expect a harvest of around
 350 to 500 grams per square yard of grow space.
                                  The buds of this plant are distinctly lemon-smelling,
  No Mercy Supply,             but have a sweet citrusy smoke that dances around the

 Seeds’ Kushage and Delta 9 Labs’ pure Afghan male. The Kushage was a phenotype
 that leaned towards its Kush side and had more orange colored hairs than pink. The
 male plant was a heavy Afghani indica that helps make Double Kush a big bud producer.
    Double Kush likes to be grown in a SOG set up and the yield increases if grown
 hydroponically. Growers can give their plant a heavy feeding of around EC 2 at the
                              highest point during the feed cycle, but be sure to flush
                              before harvest. Double Kush tends to grow more like a
                              bush and doesn’t stretch, so it can easily be maintained
                              at less than 3 feet in height. The outdoor flowering time
                              is at the end of October and the indoor time is 9 to 10
                              weeks. The yield is approximately 400 to 500 grams per
                              square yard of grow space.
                                 Recreational and medical users enjoy the fruity taste
  Delta 9 Labs, Holland       and smell of Double Kush. Similarly, people worldwide
  Indica-Dominant             enjoy the heady indica buzz with its uplifting tones, and
  Genetics: Kushage x         medical users especially appreciate the high pain and oc-
  Afghan Kush                 ular relief this plant can offer, due to its high CBD content.

Dready Berry
 Dready Seeds is the breeding project of Weed World columnist and celebrated
 cannabis connoisseur Dready Bob, and his strains are fast gaining popularity world-
 wide. One of the most popular is Dready Berry, an F1 Blueberry and White Widow
 hybrid. This is quite the gene pool to swim in, with the acclaimed Blueberry from DJ
 Short being a breeder’s favorite and White Widow having dominated the scene since
 its introduction to the market in 1995, most notably in the coffee shops of Amsterdam.
 The plethora of Blueberry strains available these days are testament to the quality
 and popularity of these genetics and just mention White Widow to any stoner to un-
 derstand that this mix is one to pay attention to.
    Adaptable to both indoor and outdoor grows, Dready Berry goes mad when grown
 outside and can end up growing as much as ten feet high. It is quite the formidable
 looking plant as its blue/purple colorings emerge and, if you wish for a cold snap, you
 might even see it exhibit a gorgeous multicolored spread. If you drop the temperature
                               of your indoor grow room a little too much you will also
  Dready Seeds, UK             see this happen; however, beautiful though it may be,
  Indica-Dominant              this cacophony of color is a good indicator that you need
  Genetics: Blueberry x        to nudge the thermostat a bit. Dready Berry’s preferred
  White Widow                  climate is a warm, humid one, and the plant resists mold
  Potency: THC 16-20%          well in these conditions. A good dose of nutrients can do
  dreadyseeds.com              well for this plant but be sure that you’re not over feeding
                               – yellowing leaf tips and wilting leaves can all be signs
 that you’re hitting the nute bottle a little too hard. Make sure you flush with distilled
 water at least two weeks before harvest to make sure that your buds don’t taste of
 chemicals. Also bear in mind that once you notice the large, dense buds begin to in-
 crease rapidly in size during the last few weeks of flowering, extra care is needed to
 ensure that you don’t lose any of your yield to botrytis. Dready Berry will produce a
 substantial harvest with very resinous buds. Enjoy!
    Though your crop may look spectacular from the vegetative stage, Dready Bob
 didn’t choose the parentage for this strain based on looks alone. The fruity taste and
 aroma of their Blueberry mother and the intensity of the White Widow have both been
 preserved, meaning that a bowl of blue Dready Berry bud is a wholly delicious expe-
 rience. Strong enough to be felt but not strong enough to leave you lying on the floor
 dribbling, its penchant for pain relief means that it is a good choice for medicinal users
 and those who enjoy a relaxing toke that tastes like dessert.

Dream Catcher
 Taylor’d Genetics is an up and coming seed company based in Canada, created by
 breeders who have been working in the industry for two decades. They specialize in
 creating interesting and hardy hybrids. Their original strain Dream Catcher is named
 after the Native American hanging art pieces that are traditionally used to help people
 filter their visions while sleeping, and this strain helps to do much the same thing. The
 genetics are from the breeders’ favorite Skunk and Afghani indicas, making it a heavy
 indica-influenced mix. The presence of Skunk, the original indica/sativa hybrid, brings
 sturdy structure and great yields to the uniformity of the Afghani indica, meaning that
 Dream Catcher is a grower’s dream.
    This plant is a bit of an all-rounder, being medium in height and density, which makes
 it suitable for a number of grow situations, both indoors and out. When flowering, you’ll
 notice that the buds are wide but not too fat. As harvest time approaches they grow
 harder and more compact. When this happens, keep an eye on your buds for signs of
                                mold, as the density can give rise to precisely the warm,
  Taylor’d Genetics,            wet conditions that mold thrives in. From the start of the
  Canada                        vegetative stage the plants exhibit very symmetrical
  Indica-Dominant               growth. The uniform branching makes it unnecessary to
  Potency: THC 20%              train these Dream Catcher most of the time, and the
  basilbush.co.uk               plants are exceptionally easy to clone in order to preserve
  greenlifeseeds.com            the fantastic genetics. The plant is very resinous and has
                                large trichomes that shine pleasantly and, with flowering
 in 67 days, Dream Catcher is a fast flowerer. Be sure not to pick the buds before they’re
 fully ripe, as you’ll be missing out on some serious quality smoke. If you’re growing out-
 doors in the Northern hemisphere, expect harvest around October 10th.
    Though the yield of this plant may not be as huge as some other hybrids, you’ll
 walk away with a very good size stash and the quality of the nugs surpasses that of
 a lot of other high-yielding plants. Dream Catcher buds have a silky smoke that bursts
 into melon and strawberry flavors as soon as it hits your tongue. Much like its name
 sake, the high appeases the mind by only letting positivity and good energy into your
 head, but it also packs a dense body feeling that leaves you somewhere between
 sleep and wakefulness – a feeling that you certainly won’t forget in a hurry. Check
 your local dispensary for some delicious nugs of Dream Catcher and you won’t regret
 it – this strain has incredible medicinal potential, as well as a joyful and uplifting high
 that recreational smokers worldwide will love.

Garberville Purple Kush
 Ocanabis is a Canadian grower who got hold of this classic Purple Kush strain a few
 years ago, and now preserves this fantastic plant. Though it originally came from the
 mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan, it was bred and popularized in California, al-
 legedly by K of Trichome Technologies. Thought to be a cross between Purple Afghani
 and pure Hindu Kush genetics, this strain has given rise to many variations, including
 Kyle Kushman’s Las Vegas Purple Kush and Clone Only’s GPK. It is most notably
 available at the Sky Blue Coffee Shop in Oakland.
    There are several different phenotypes of GPK around, but a flowering time of
 around 55 days should be expected. This can extend to 70 days with particularly late-
 flowering cuts. It grows most favorably in soil or hydro set ups, but yields heavily in
 all media as long as it’s tended to properly. As ever with Blue or Purple strains, cooler
 temperatures will bring out the great-looking coloration in the growing buds and make
 your garden look absolutely amazing.
    Both smell and flavor of the resulting buds have hints of dark fruit, with underlying
                               tones coming from the Afghani roots. The high comes on
  Ocanabis, Canada             quickly with an energetic rush and a nice body high. Aches
  Indica-Dominant              and pains melt away, which is fantastic for medicinal users
  Potency: THC 19%             as well as those just looking for some serious chill time.

Gordy Spice #18
 Grown by Jeffman of the Blazing Pistileros Crew, Gordy Spice #18 is a variety that
 the celebrated Motarebel bred for an ill friend who needed a strain that would kill his
 pain without putting him straight to sleep. To achieve this goal, Motarebel crossed a
 G-13 with a Californian indica Northern Lights #5 from the BC Seed Company.
    The result is a great-looking plant that’s almost made for the first-time grower, as
 it’s very resilient and forgiving. Whether your rookie error is to overfeed, under venti-
 late or let the tips grow too close to your bulbs, Gordy can put up with just about any-
                               thing. Good feeding will reward you with repeated growth
                               spurts and super dense, frosty buds. Just before the fin-
                               ishing mark of 60 days, you’ll get a nice purple tint on
                               the cola and even on the leaves.
                                  The effects of Gordy Spice #18 are said to be even
                               stronger than Motarebel’s Herijuana, so watch your in-
                               take if you’re smoking this for the first time. The reason
  Breeder: Motarebel           this strain was created, though, was for the ability to

Grape Stomper
 Providing quality strains for the medical marijuana users of California, Gage Green Ge-
 netics are making a name for themselves with such strains as Blueberry Pie and this,
 their indica-dominant Grape Stomper. This strain has a complex and striking history,
 comprising the late breeder JojoRizo’s Purple Elephant, a Purple Urkle Hashplant, and
 Chemdog Sour Diesel from Elite Seeds. The Chemdog Sour Diesel is actually a hybrid
 of Headband and Sour Diesel, which makes it a fantastic plant to breed from and grow.
    One of the most beautiful strains in recent times, Grape Stomper has much more
 going for her than just her lavender trichomes. Stacked thick and dense, these swell
 to their fullest at 63 days. She yields well and even in a 2 gallon pot under a 1000-
 watt HPS indoors, she will give you an enviable stash. Great for training, as she
 spreads well, she could be a good choice for a SOG set up. The density and weight
 of her flowers might make staking necessary in the later stages so keep an eye out.
    When you smoke your first home-grown Grape Stomper joint, the thick, warm,
                              cosy effect will slide you into a relaxing stone. The
  Gage Green Genetics,        pain-relieving qualities of Grape Stomper along with
  USA                         the gorgeous fruity taste that gives her her name will

Grubbycup’s Stash
 The name of this strain couldn’t be more telling if it tried; bred by marijuana author
 Grubbycup, it’s come to be a favorite of his, and therefore he always makes sure
 to have it as a big part of his stash. Working out of the USA, Grubbycup used a
 cross between a White Rhino, of Indian and Afghani indica and Brazilian sativa ge-
 netics, and a Blueberry plant for the father, and romantically introduced this to a
 Blackberry / Purple Lady cross. These parents not only exhibited potency and fruit
 flavors, but both have the thick buds and strong plant structure that Grubbycup
 wanted to harness.
    The way the plant grows is actually its most notable feature; in later generations
 of seeds, a trait known as whorled phyllotaxis is common. In layman’s terms, this
 means that there are three or four branches per node, instead of the usual two. If
 your seeds are of an earlier generation, this may not occur, but you definitely will see
 fat leaves and tight floral clusters that can be grown as a single cola or multiples, de-
                               pending on how you choose to prune the plant. Due to
  Grubbycup Stash Seeds,       the busy branches, and despite the strength of the
  USA                          plant’s structure, you might find that in the flowering
  Indica-Dominant              stages it starts to drop its arms somewhat under the
  Genetics: (White Rhino x     weight of all those buds. If this occurs, simply stake to
  Blueberry) x (Blackberry x   the branches to support them and keep an eye on them
  Purple Lady)                 for the rest of the grow period. Netting can also be used
  Potency: THC 17%             to this effect, though it’s a little more complicated. Pri-
  grubbycup.org                marily grown indoors, Grubbycup’s Stash finishes in
                               around 10 weeks and has many traits that make it suit-
 able for a less experienced grower, including a high tolerance to bud rot and over-
 feeding of nutrients. However, even a toker who’s been growing their own for 40 years
 will appreciate the unique look of these plants and the ease with which they can be
 brought to harvest. It’s not a coincidence that these plants are the breeder’s favorites,
 and as the buds grow to their full size in their last weeks of flowering it will probably
 become your plant of choice, too.
    This strain has a very strong effect straight off, but fades somewhat and gives way
 to a much more long-lasting stone that creeps up on you when you think the high is
 almost over. The flavor is clean and tasty and the smoke is mild, and though the ef-
 fects are strongly felt, it’s heady enough that you can smoke this guy all day, if the
 fancy takes you.

Hashberry
 Hashberry from Spain’s celebrated Mandala Seeds was primarily created because
 the breeders felt that there was a lack of truly vigorous and resistant indicas on the
 seed market. Hashberry is a super vigorous, reliable and problem-resistant plant that
 is made up of Californian and North Indian (Kashmiri) genetics that were carefully se-
 lected over years of research.
    Hashberry is a great indica that will grow to a medium height and is a good choice
 for growers with limited space, and works well in SOG set ups. This plant develops a
 tight and heavy head bud with dense buds located on her firm side shoots. The bud
 leaves have a healthy coat of THC glands, which will fill your pollinator/bubble bags
 very generously. Hashberry is easy to trim, heat and pest resistant, and simple to
 grow. Keep humidity levels and watering low during the last 2 weeks of flowering to
 prevent any mold from forming in the compact top buds.
    Medical patients love Hashberry for its anti-anxiety, sleep-inducing capabilities, as
                               well as a high that sets in after the first toke. The buzz
  Mandala Seeds, Spain         starts off as lightheaded and very balanced, and then
  Indica-Dominant              gets a little heavier near the end of the trip. Hash made
  Genetics: Californian        from this strain is incredibly potent and can overwhelm
  Hybrid x Landrace North      the inexperienced toker, so be careful.

Himalaya Blue Diesel
 Himalaya Blue Diesel comes from the veritable hive of cannabis activity, Spain. Short
 Stuff Seeds is a collective of breeders committed to providing high-grade seeds at af-
 fordable prices. The company specializes in auto-flowering plants, so Himalaya Blue
 Diesel will flower without changing the light cycle. This is thanks to a parentage that
 is part Diesel Ryder, which itself is NYC Diesel crossed with the Joint Doctor’s Lowry-
 der #2, and part Blue Himalaya—an auto strain created by introducing a big Nepalese
                                                  Kush to an Auto Blueberry.
                                                     The breeders have done well to stabi-
                                                  lize this strain and you should see fairly

  Spain                                           fertilizers. They will usually only grow to
  Indica-Dominant                                 around 20 to 30 inches at the very most. A
  Genetics: Lowyrder #2 x Blueberry x             plant of this size will give you around 30

                                                  of molasses can do wonders and perk
 your plant up greatly. Plan to harvest at around 10 weeks from seeding, as the extra
 couple of weeks can really make a difference and you will have the chance to enjoy the
 beautiful colors of this great plant. These buds, if harvested too early, can reportedly
 give a very racy kind of high instead of the slow, relaxing stone that they’re most known
 and coveted for. To avoid this, and to find out why so many growers choose this strain,
 resist all your temptation to harvest until you’re sure the buds are ready!
    Like a lot of indica-dominant strains, Himalaya Blue Diesel bud has both fruity and
 spicy elements when smoked and packs an aromatic kick when you open your stash.
 The influence of the Blue family comes out slightly in the aroma as a nice hint of berries,
 but the biggest pleasure comes in the smoke. This is a fun bit of bud, very giggly as
 well as a total knockout that’s likely to leave you couch locked for a good few hours.
 Taste it and see why it’s become the favorite of so many smokers out there!

Hindu Kush
 Original Seeds is a passionate breeder’s collective operating out of Russia that fo-
 cuses mainly on landrace genetics. For this strain, Original Seeds worked with two
 different Hindu Kush strains, and the Kush landrace was added to this mix to create
 a spectacular early-flowering homogenous phenotype. The specific genetics of these
 plants are unclear, though one is assumed to be from somewhere even more western
 and mountainous than the princely heights of Chitral in Pakistan.
    This Hindu Kush strain gives small, deep green plants when grown indoors, but
 outdoors, the plants can reach beyond 10 feet in height. The branching forms a cone
 or pyramid, and will bloom into many gorgeous colors if treated with extra potassium.
 While purebred Hindu Kush plants are not suitable for smoking, the Kush landrace
 genetics in this plant provide extra resinous buds that are used by locals to make
 hash (charas) and well as for smoking. Hindu Kush yields dense buds and a heavy
 harvest, and is great for a beginner grower.
                                 Hindu Kush plants have a more mild, pleasant taste
  Original Seeds, Russia      than Afghani indicas and can smell of sandalwood and
  Pure Indica                 charas. The stone has a hypnotic, knock-out effect,
  Genetics: Landrace          though it is a quiet and contemplative high rather than

                          Advanced Seeds are a fast-growing Spanish seed company in more ways than
                          one; they specialize in feminized and auto-flowering strains. Ice Kush is a stellar
                          blend of classic Kush genetics from the Hindu Kush mountains, and an equally im-
                          pressive South African sativa plant. This mix produces plants with a typical indica
                          look and shape, but with a larger production of buds and a larger size thanks to
                          the sativa influence. The South African sativa also brings a large leaf shape and
                          pleasing flavor to this plant.
                             Ice Kush can reach an indoor height of 3 to 4 feet, and an outdoor height of 6.5 to
                          10 feet isn’t uncommon, due to the sativa influences as well as its vigorous growth
                          patterns. This will give a yield of 350 to 450 grams per square yard. The flowering
                          time indoors sits at around week 7 or 8 and outdoors, in the Northern hemisphere,

Iranian Autoflower
 Iranian Autoflower (IAF) from Canadian breeder Dr. Greenthumb is an Iranian landrace
 that yields in a way that many auto-flowering plants do not, and by that I mean enor-
 mously. IAF produces 100 to 200 grams per plant, and is harvested in June in
 Canada, making this a ridiculously fast crop. Dr. Greenthumb has managed to cap-
 ture the high yield characteristics of Iranian landrace plants, and has compacted
 them into an incredibly fast growing, auto-flowering plant that growers worldwide
 are recommending.
    With such pace, this plant has to get its energy from somewhere, so it will need a
 lot of light. IAF grows to about 40 inches in height, has a flowering time of about 90
 to 100 days, and the plant is ready for harvest after 6 weeks of flowering. This plant
 grows fine outdoors from seed, but you can also start the plant indoors and plant it
 outside in the spring.
    IAF nugs offer a creeper-type stone. It begins with a euphoric, social high that many
                               find quite uplifting, and then evolves into a very happy,
  Dr. Greenthumb Seeds,        body stone that can help you relax after a long day. If
  Canada                       you’ve ever had an Iranian landrace strain before, you’ll
  Indica-Dominant              know the hashy taste that we all love for its unquestionable
  Genetics: Iranian            potency and reliability, especially for medical patients.

Jet Fuel
                         Coming from Sativa Tim, an independent American breeder, Jet Fuel is the result of
                         several years of work to stabilize one of his favorite crosses. With a family tree which
                         includes Green Giant from the Brothers Grimm, Humboldt Select, and Apollo 11, an-
                         other Brothers Grimm strain, it’s easy to guess why this plant held such appeal for him.
                            Jet Fuel is an indica-dominant hybrid which nevertheless shows some sativa traits,
                         such as leaves broken into seven distinct segments. Its plants are sturdy and short
                         with a strong structure. Light is a big issue with these plants so be sure that they don’t
                         languish in the dark corners of your grow room. From seed to finishing should last
                         around 2 months or less with a good amount of wattage. A healthy amount of nutrients
                         will leave you much rewarded upon harvest, though the yield won’t be particularly
                         heavy. This is a connoisseur’s strain, whose buds are worth cultivating for their density
                         and potency alone. Growing in an organic set up could enhance the taste even further,
                         and make your Jet Fuel harvest something really special.

                                                           Jet Fuel was so named for its gaseous smoke with
                          Sativa Tim, USA               undertones of orange, and a taste that’s interestingly

                          Humboldt Select x Apollo 11   is strong without being overpowering.

Kalijah
 Well-respected and much renowned in their native Spain, Reggae Seeds specializes
 in creating strains with great taste and a potency to match. Kalijah is the offspring of
 DJ Short’s Blue Heaven, a true Blueberry child with Thai and Afghani heritage which
 is no longer available in seed form. A Blue Heaven mother was bred with a male that
 incorporates Mexican and Afghani lines to create the indica-dominant Kalijah.
    This plant can be grown indoors in relatively small containers and flourishes very
 well in a SOG garden. For optimum results the breeders advise leaving the plants in
 the vegetative stage for 5 weeks before forcing flowering. A Kalijah crop won’t need
 a lot of nutrients and is fairly impartial about the medium it grows in, making it a good
 choice if you don’t have much cultivation experience. Out of doors the plants branch
 heavily but don’t grow too tall, and give beautifully-colored, compact buds. Expect
 harvest at the end of September in the northern hemisphere.
    The much-revered Blue heritage that Kalijah enjoys comes through for the toker
                               in the delicious smoke and the fantastic high. You’ll be

Kamoto Kush
 USA-based company M.G.M. Genetics is a medical cooperative passionate about cre-
 ating strains that help patients. One of these is Kamoto Kush, the end result of a project
 left unfinished by the breeders’ mentor. This Purple Kush was a mix of pure Kush and
 a bag seed purple male, which M.G.M. then crossed with his original i6 male over sev-
 eral generations until he found the phenotype that became Kamoto Kush.
    With so many indica/sativa cross strains around it’s easy to forget what happens
 when you lose the vigor of a hybrid, but Kamoto Kush, a pure indica, grows slowly
 in the vegetative state and needs a full 60 days in bloom to reach its potential. It is
                               also very sensitive to temperature and, to bring it into
                               color, you will need to expose it to lower temperatures.
                               These plants will reward you well if grown in their fa-
                               vorite hydro set up.
                                   Though the bud isn’t overly aromatic, you will detect a
                               smell of coffee and melting hash in your nose and a sweet,

Kandahar
 Ministry of Cannabis prides itself on creating exclusive strains for serious growers,
 and by crossing an enigmatic strain of the famous Skunk with Afghani genetics,
 they’ve achieved exactly that! The Skunk parentage was reportedly stabilized in the
 late 70s by Sam the Skunkman of Sacred Seeds, bringing together for the first time
 the taste of a sativa with the quick flowering and heavy yield of an indica; this, of
 course, changed the industry. The resulting hybrid brought together Afghani, Mexican
 and Colombian genetics to create a strain that was to become one of the most well-
 known in recent history. In crossing this plant with an Afghani indica, found on hillsides
 around the city of Kandahar which gives the strain its name, the team at Ministry of
 Cannabis created a strain with extremely high indica dominance (around 90%) and
 therefore a tendency towards dense flowering.
    As would be expected from an Afghani offspring, especially when crossed with the
 robust Skunk, the Kandahar plant is a very consistent one to grow and is viable in a
                               number of environments. Introducing Skunk to the equa-
  Ministry of Cannabis,        tion also gives enhanced vigor. By week 8 or 9, you will
  Holland                      have a short, bushy plant with a lot of branches, allowing
  Indica-Dominant              you to harvest up to 500 grams from an indoor grow or
  Genetics: Afghan Kanda-      400 grams outdoors. It’s interesting to note that the
  hari x Skunk                 leaves in particular can be extremely fat compared to
  Potency: THC 19.5 %          other plants. Both this, and the branching, means that
  ministryofcannabis.com       Kandahar can grow well in a ScrOG set up if properly
                               looked after. The vegetative stage can sit at around the
 4 week period, and once you switch to a 12 on/12 off light cycle you’ll notice some
 encouragingly steady growth. After the first 2 weeks of flowering, growth can be
 greatly accelerated for a week or so, but then will plateau to a steady pace to produce
 some fantastic buds with a lot of orange/brown hair. You can harvest anywhere from
 the 60 day mark.
    Kandahar, when smoked, has a distinctive musky, woody smell. By the third or
 fourth puff you may notice an aroma of roasted walnuts. Kandahar stands apart from
 the majority of strains in terms of flavor alone. If your taste buds are a little more de-
 veloped and you’ve had enough of the many fruity smokes out there, Kandahar has
 a great, mature taste. The high is said to be exceptionally powerful, with the ability to
 satisfy even the most dedicated stoner. Between the taste and the effects, Kandahar
 is definitely one for the serious pothead to enjoy.

King’s Kush
 Since 1985, Green House Seed Company has been flourishing in all kinds of re-
 spects. Now the most recognizable of all the Dutch seed companies and coffee shops
 thanks to their top quality genetics. King’s Kush is no different, and is known for its
 productivity and intense, spicy aroma. A hybrid of Clone Only’s fantastic and game-
 changing strain O.G. Kush and a Grape Ape original clone, this strain leans heavily
 towards the Kush traits, which is great news for anyone who gets hold of its seeds.
 The O.G. Kush parent, which itself is a product of ChemDawg crossed with Hindu
 Kush / Lemon Thai, is steeped in pot lore and hype, and has become a favorite of
 breeders worldwide.
    When transplanting your King’s Kush seedlings, ensure that the light source isn’t
 too high from the medium as your babies will stretch to reach the light and may col-
 lapse under their own weight before you even get started. If you avoid that, this
 medium-sized indica will have long branches shooting both outwards and upwards,
                               and deep green leaves tinged with purple, thanks to the
  Green House Seed Co.,        Grape genetics. As with all Purple strains, the most in-
  Holland                      tense colorings come out in colder temperatures, so if
  Indica-Dominant              you’re growing outside in a colder climate or choose to
  Genetics: OG Kush x          drop the temperature of your indoor grow room, you’ll
  Grape                        be honored with a spectacular display of violet and
  Potency: THC 19%             blues. Though these plants look fairly tame in their
  greenhouseseeds.nl           stature, don’t be afraid to feed them like a particularly
                               ravenous UFC fighter, as near-extreme feeding will re-
 sult in enhanced flowering; you can go up to 2.3 EC in a hydro set up and 1.9 EC in
 a soil grow. Be sure to flush regularly to prevent excess build up in your system as
 this can have a negative impact on growth. The average flowering time for King’s
 Kush is 9 weeks, and by this time, the blue-purple veins on the plant will be going
 wild, giving you a grow room that looks almost magical. If you’re growing outside, aim
 to harvest at the end of October.
    King’s Kush is definitely regal in its grape aroma, which is pungent, intense and
 tangy. It comes across as both sweet and sour, which makes for a nice change from
 the tons of sweet weed out there. As well as the grape smell, there are hints of laven-
 der and moss, giving rise to a hard-hitting munchies-inducing high. When the need
 to feed subsides, you’ll slip into a very lethargic, dreamy and mildly euphoric state
 that’s exactly what every stoner is looking for.

Kong
 Holy Smoke Seeds are flying the flag for South African breeders in Europe by offering
 great strains with fine genetics. One of these is Kong, which comprises the pedigrees
 of Magus Genetics’ long-awaited Motavation, a cross of Sensi Star and Warlock, and
 Serious Seeds’ phenomenal child of AK-47 and White Widow, known as White Russ-
 ian. Motavation was chosen for its high resin production and great stature, while White
 Russian brought a quicker rate of flowering and huge calyxes.
    Heavily indica in looks and growing, Kong has a tendency to grow immensely fat
 if not trimmed or trained, which can be tricky to handle. With this massive growth,
 however, come the huge, fluffy colas that all growers love to see and harvest, as they
 know that a huge return is coming their way. Though you can bring in this yield at 6
 weeks, if you can hang out for 2 more weeks, it will be worth your while.
    If you’re wondering where the name comes from, just take a seat and have a toke,
 but don’t expect to get up any time soon. A beast of a stone that hits you like a truck,
                               Kong will put you out for a while whether you have one

Kushdee
 Holland’s All Star Genetics are two breeders committed to bringing the best of the
 Amsterdam coffee shop strains to the wider world in the form of stabilized seeds. A
 big part of the Dutch cannabis community since the early 90s, these guys are using
 their experience to work on classic strains with a twist. Their award-winning
 Kushdee is a blend of the much sought-after O.G. Kush female, acquired from a
 friend of the breeder, and a male Spanish indica known as Alegria from the guys at
 Kiwi Seeds. This male was selected from the 2 best phenotypes that came from
 100 Alegria seeds.
    By introducing the husky Alegria to the Kush line, ASG have improved the Kush
 yield and its vitality, bringing an increased rate of growth as well as heftier, dank buds.
 One notable trait of this plant is its enormous stalks, which are necessary to hold the
 weight of the bigger flowers that she produces. You’ll also see wider, well-shaped
 leaves with a lush green color. Topping this plant will increase the yield as several
                                head colas are forced, and though it can finish in around

KWT
 Zenseeds is one of the premier Danish seed companies, offering a wide variety of
 niche strains for growers worldwide. KWT is their remake of underground breeding
 hero Krome’s The White, which is also known as “Triangle” as it was originally a 3
 way cross. Despite assumptions, KWT is not related to the infamous White Widow.
 The White is so named because of the astonishing crystal look it has and the frosty
 white buds it produces.
    Easy to clone, KWT will pop roots in 5 to 7 days if you use rockwool or a bubble
 cloner, though she’ll need a fair amount of humidity and the cubes must not be soaking
 wet. During the early stages of vegetative growth she does need a fair amount of atten-
 tion, and responds particularly well to being topped. Though we cannot be sure of the
 genetics, the relatively thin branches and minor stretch point to a sativa influence. This
 stretch will increase during flowering so you’ll need to give some attention to training, as
 well as staking, to give extra support to her flowering sites. Be sure to use a carbon
                                scrubber, and though she’ll look as if she’s ready for har-

                    DNA Genetics, based in Amsterdam, has been producing high-quality seeds such as
                    L.A. Confidential, a multiple-award-winning pure indica, since 2004. This plant’s fan-
                    tastic genes come from an Afghani landrace and an old school, killer Afghani strain
                    from Southern California. It’s often thought to be related to the O.G. Kush family, but
                    this is a myth.
                       Though this plant is much imitated, there are two real L.A. Confidential phenotypes,
                    one of which is slightly sturdier than the other. Pre-vegging is advised with this plant
                    and doing so will maximize the amount of bud you’ll get from harvest – expect around
                    400 grams of dried, cured bud per square yard of grow space. Both phenotypes will
                    finish between 45 and 56 days. Don’t be afraid to remove some of the fan leaves to-
                    wards the end of the flowering period, as this will allow more light to reach the lower
                    buds and stimulate their growth.
                       A huge part of L.A. Confidential’s popularity is its ability to deliver a knock-down
                                                  stone. True L.A. Confidential buds are lime green with a

 from there, became an authority on cannabis genetics. Resin Seeds breeds, engineers
 and supplies product for medical marijuana users, as well as seed buyers looking for
 stability in their gardens. L.A. Ultra contains genetics from the well-known L.A. Confi-
 dential as well as MK Ultra, making it a very reliable all-rounder plant that has earned
 accolades worldwide.
    Due to the heavy indica influence, plants will be fairly short and stubby, lending
 themselves to both indoor and outdoor environments. L.A. Confidential is resistant to
 mildew, and L.A. Ultra has inherited this enviable characteristic, making it a great out-
 door strain. If you work indoors, don’t be afraid to try this plant in an organic soil grow,
 as its hardiness makes it great for this sort of set up. Although a hydroponic set up
                                isn’t necessary for such a simple and easy plant, if you
  Resin Seeds, Spain            choose to go down that route your plant will respond well
  Indica-Dominant               and look amazingly healthy. Flowering begins to occur
  Genetics: MK Ultra x L.A.     between 45 and 55 days but, due to the MK Ultra parent-
  Confidential                  age, the period from here to harvest isn’t as short as it is
  Potency: THC 19-23%           for other indica strains. However, as early as 3 weeks
  resinseeds.net                into flowering, your plants should be covered in tri-
                                chomes – patience will be necessary to wait for the right
 harvesting time! You’ll know that you are getting there when your plants start to give
 off a spicy stench that stings the nostrils, but hang in there for as long as possible to
 ensure the most potent and dense buds you could ever wish for. An outdoor grow can
 be harvested in September with expected yields of 100 to 250 grams per plant, and
 indoors, you should take away around 350 grams of premium L. A. Ultra bud from each
 square yard of grow space.
    When flowering, the buds give off a slightly spicy and fruity aroma, and often dis-
 play gorgeous crystal white buds. Both L.A. Confidential and MK Ultra are known to
 give energetic, hard-hitting highs, and the former has been reported to give a psy-
 chedelic experience if enough is inhaled or ingested. Expect a heady and stimulating
 high that tokers in Spain are raving about. The ‘hypnotic’ stone of MK Ultra means
 that this is not a wake 'n bake strain – be sure to set aside some time to enjoy a de-
 cent, fulfilling trip.

Lemonberry
 Fusion Seeds is a Dutch seed company producing original strains from a stock of
 fantastic genetics. Lemonberry is a cross between Dabney Blue, a very potent strain
 from the Blueberry family, and Lemon Thai Flower Time, which as the name sug-
 gests, is of Thai heritage. Crossing two strains known for their intense and distinctive
 flavors has resulted in a plant that’s both beautiful and bursting with flavor!
    Originating in the Pacific Northwest, Lemonberry is a strain for those who love
 DJ Short’s game-changing Blueberry line. Thought to be a Thai cross acclimatized
 to the Hawaiian islands, Lemonberry can be grown either indoors or outdoors and
 can also be happily cultivated in a greenhouse set up. The indica dominance of
 this strain makes the plants relatively short and bushy, though the sativa of the
 Lemon Thai parent strain brings a medium stretch in the flowering stage that also
 delivers large yields of citrus-flavored buds. Due to the existence of different phe-
 notypes, an exact flowering time is hard to estimate, but it should be in the 8 to 10
                               week range.
  Fusion Seeds, Holland           The taste of this strain definitely lives up to its name,
  Indica-Dominant              with citrus and berry tangs as well as a delightful sweet-

                                     You won’t have to go far in the cannabis community before you run into Lowryder, the
                                     Joint Doctor’s biggest gift to the growing world. The Joint Doctor created this ground-
                                     breaking plant by crossing a pure indica William’s Wonder with the Seed Bank’s North-

                                     25 years ago. A feral variety of cannabis that’s unable to provide a decent high on its
                                     own, ruderalis was introduced into this mix primarily for resilience and its ability to move
                                     into the flowering stage regardless of the changes of light cycles, or lack thereof.
                                        The first strain to ever exhibit these ‘auto-flowering’ capabilities, Lowryder practically
                                     does away with the vegetative stage entirely, sprouting a few leaves then flowering
                                     between 17 and 20 days. This doesn’t leave you with a lackluster plant, however, as

                                     only 8 weeks leaving a small but dense plant. The rest of the breeding scene scram-

Machine Gum
 Spain’s Muppet Seeds is a new seed company quickly making a name for itself in
 the cannabis community. An offspring of Bubble Gum, which was created back in
 1993, and a cross between a California indica and a California Desert Sativa, Ma-
 chine Gum is mostly-indica in genetics and loves an indoor grow room. Bubble Gum
 in particular is known to be a highly stabilized strain with just one phenotype, which
 has led to its popularity as breeding stock, and it brings a uniformity and sweet taste
 to Machine Gum plants.
    Machine Gum tends to be of medium height and though plants can grow in any
 environment, they will perform to their best if growers use organic cultivation meth-
 ods. Chemical-free cannabis growing has become much more popular in recent
 years, and thanks to the growing demand for good products and decent information,
 there are now many great plant-based fertilizers and nutrients for both indoor and
 outdoor growers alike as well as books and blogs on the topic. You can also use
                                 household waste such as eggshells and coffee grounds
  The Muppet Seeds,              to amend soil and encourage growth. Organic growing
  Spain                          has also been said to give a tastier smoke and strong
  Indica-Dominant                effects, so it can’t hurt to try! Machine Gum’s high re-
  Genetics: Bubble Gum x         sistance to pests means that you shouldn’t find any little
  California Indica/California   critters eating away your crop, and this makes it a good
  Desert Sativa                  choice for a first timers. You should, however, keep your
  Potency: THC 15%               eyes peeled for any signs of mold, which can occur in
  sinsemillast.com               warmer climates or if the humidity of your grow room is
                                 high. Keep the air inside your room moving well and
 make sure ventilation is one of your main priorities – especially towards the end of
 the flowering stage, when the sweet aroma of the plants will increase. For best re-
 sults, consider pruning your plant, especially around the central cola, and it will re-
 spond well. In general, the flowering period takes place at about 8 or 9 weeks and
 will give a good sized harvest.
    Sniff the buds of Machine Gum and you’ll be hit by the delicious sweetness that
 gives parent plant Bubble Gum its title. This aroma transfers into the taste of the
 smoked bud, and you’ll also taste a smooth menthol flavor after the main hit of the
 smoke subsides. However, the high of this strain is even more impressive than the
 flavor, and renders you positively childlike: a euphoric, giggly mess with a gleeful op-
 timism that will linger even when the stone is done.

Mad Lion OG
 The AKVC Collective is an innovative cannabis collective operating in the USA that
 invented the world’s first canned cannabis products, allowing bud to be stored in dis-
 pensaries and at patients’ homes for longer periods of time. Mad Lion OG is their
 strain and is available in the aforementioned cans from medical dispensaries in Cal-
 ifornia. Mad Lion OG has inherited the pungent aroma of its Jamaican Kush father
 and the delicious taste of its Skywalker OG mother.
    Mad Lion OG has an incredibly pungent aroma that is almost loud in its intensity,
 so you’ll need a good air filtration system to remain discreet. You will also appreciate
 the air-tight storage when carrying your cured bud and not getting busted. She grows
 best indoors and reaches a height of up to 6 feet. Mad Lion OG flowers in 8 weeks
 and takes 6 weeks to ripen after forced flowering. She prefers soil or hydroponic sys-
 tems and can be viny because of her Jamaican influence, so the breeder recom-
 mends using plant netting to keep things under control. Yield can be up to 85 grams
                               per plant depending on your lights.
  AKVC Collective, USA            Smokers love this strain for its high that starts out
  Indica-Dominant              very cerebral, like a pure sativa, but then, when the in-

Mamba
 Green Lantern Seeds is a fairly underground collective, run by two breeders going
 by the names of Manic and Inkognyto, who specialize in growing and breeding strains
 that will offer some respite for other patients and themselves. For this strain, Inkognyto
 reversed a pre-98 Bubba Kush male, to pollinate a female plant of the notorious
 ChemDawg strain, from noted breeder Rezdog. This resulted in a plant with 60/40
 Bubba Kush to ChemDawg ratio. While the history of ChemDawg’s parentage is
 steeped in mystique, we can assume that there’s a heavy dose of indica in there, and
 Bubba Kush was a product of OG Kush, West Coast Dog and Old World Kush, giving
 us a heritage that spreads from the USA all the way to Pakistan.
    Mamba, when vegetated properly, is a much denser plant than its Bubba Kush fa-
 ther. It also outdoes its Pops in terms of yield, but doesn’t slip on the quality. The har-
 vested nugs will be thick and tight, as well as sizeable. Be sure to give this plant plenty
 of light so she can produce to her full potential.
                                   The resulting bud is stronger than is given by either
  Green Lantern Seeds           of its parents, and delivers a very pleasant, heavy-
  featuring Inkognyto,          headed high that will encourage sleep and keep anxiety

Mamba Negra
 Spain’s Blimburn Seeds is an emerging seed bank focused on credibility and maximum
 stability of strains as well as plants with psychoactive effects. SL Green Guide and a
 group of noted growers have teamed up to create the company, and they have set about
 making a name for themselves in the increasingly-competitive Spanish seed market.
 The exotic and dangerously seductive-sounding Mamba Negra has come from the hands
 of the same people who created the celebrated Kritikal Bilbo. Mamba Negra was bred
 from an Afghani and Skunk offspring from Mr. Nice Seeds known as Critical Mass, an
 award-winning and popular breed, which was crossed with another Skunk family member
                               for stability and great growing strength. Critical Mass is
                               known in the growing community for both its dense,
                               heavy-yielding plants and the punch that it carries in its
                               smoke, and was selected as a parent strain for those very
                               traits. The Mamba Negra now on the market is the culmi-
                               nation of 3 years of improvements on the original 2008 va-
  Blimburn Seeds, Spain        riety, and is much more stabilized thanks to that effort.
  Indica-Dominant                  Mamba Negra seeds will give a crop of very uniform
  Genetics: Critical Mass x    plants, as the phenotype has been so secured, and each
  Skunk                        plant will exhibit a large central baton. Flowering will bring
  Potency: THC 18%             very tight and hugely fragrant colas, the bud of which is
  blimburnseeds.com            covered in red hair and smells like ripened fruit. Though
                               the plant is particularly well-suited to an indoor set up, it
 will take advantage of the extra space outside, growing large and blooming extra early.
 Mamba Negra is very resistant to botrytis and the size of the yield depends on your
 level of growing skill; proper care can result in an even larger harvest. Flowering should
 occur between the 55 and 65 day mark, and upwards of 500 grams of dried, cured bud
 can be expected from each square meter of grow space indoors. If your Mamba Negra
 is growing outside, it should be ready for harvest around the end of September.
    This is an interesting smoke which moves through waves of physical and cerebral
 effects in turn, without giving you the roller-coaster effect that can sometimes occur.
 The taste is rich and elaborate, with hints of fruit, and the smoke is a definite lung-ex-
 pander. The effects are somewhat similar to parent strain Critical Mass in that it re-
 laxes the toker, but this is a little stronger and longer lasting. The comforting yet
 exciting high, coupled with the fruity and delicious smoke means that Mamba Negra
 is nowhere near as vicious as she sounds.

Master Kush
 Amsterdam’s White Label Seeds is a respected seed bank with a very loyal following.
 White Label provides some of the most recognizable cannabis strains on the market,
 as well as newer ‘White’ varieties of old timer strains, such as Haze and Diesel. With
 Master Kush, however, White Label chose not to mess with a proven winner and pro-
 vided a hybrid of Indian and Afghani lines straight from separate areas of the Hindu
 Kush region in Northern Pakistan. Just uttering the name ‘Kush’ will have most stoners
 frothing at the mouth, and this strain is no different. Tokers worldwide enjoy the smooth
 flavor of this beauty.
    Master Kush plants tend to favor indoor set ups, and once your friends find out
 you are growing a Kush plant it might become necessary to have a year-round grow
 op going just to keep up with demand. The plant is happy enough in a simple soil set
 up, and though it can suffer if you get carried away with the nutrients, it is a very
 straightforward plant to grow. Master Kush is mold resistant, but as always you should
                               keep your grow room well-ventilated. As with all indicas,
  White Label Seeds,           your plants won’t grow overly tall, but will grow strong
  Holland                      and fairly bushy. Expect the high resin production for
  Indica-Dominant              which all Kush plants are known, and the reliably great
  Genetics: Hindu Kush x       yields. As these plants are so sought-after and hardy,
  Hindu Kush                   you might want to consider growing them in a hydropon-
  Potency: THC 16%             ics set up, in which they’ve been said to do notably well.
  whitelabelseeds.com          Their vigorous growth can be complimented by a regular
                               feeding and nutrient regime and this could help you to
 get the very best out of what is already a great plant. Also, regardless of how the bud
 actually turns out, telling people that you have hydro Master Kush will suddenly make
 you a very popular friend, and the street value will go through the roof.
    Serious smokers will recognize the distinctive flavor of hand-rubbed charas
 hashish, which is actually made from Hindu Kush weed in Northern Pakistan and
 Central Afghanistan. The high of this strain avoids the mind-numbing effects of a
 lot of indica-heavy strains and won’t leave you totally baked and unable to spell
 your own name. It does, however, pack a fairly serious body stone with a euphoric,
 giggly result. Expect an incredibly smooth smoke, especially through a pipe, with a
 little bit more of a cough lingering if enjoyed through a bong. From a medical per-
 spective, Master Kush can help those struggling to get a good night’s sleep or suf-
 fering from stress.

 As the celebrated producers of the popular Yumbolt strain, Sagarmatha Seeds are
 highly thought of amongst growers and breeders alike. Based in Holland, they’ve been
 established since 1994 and consistently impress the industry with their innovative
 breeds and the purity of their genetics. Matanuska Tundra, also known to some people
 as Alaskan Thunder Fuck, is an indica-heavy plant from the Matanuska Valley of the
 Alaskan Northlands. Thanks to the quality of this strain, the seeds are highly sought
 after and can be more expensive than other seeds.
    Matanuska Tundra can be grown in any sort of grow set up, coming as it does
 from the harsh surroundings of Alaska. Average flowering time is around 60 to 70
 days. It’s relatively small and will only grow to between 20 and 30 inches, making it
 great for an indoor grow or one that has to be fairly covert. If growing indoors, be
 sure to watch the internodes with a close eye – once there are between 4 and 7
 inches in length, it’s time to force flowering.
                                   The rock-hard buds are gorgeously smooth and
  Sagarmatha Seeds,             chocolaty in their smoke and the high is seductively

Mazar-I-Sharif
 Bomba Seeds are an independent seed company based in the Ukraine. Their Mazar-i-
 Sharif plant is a pure, landrace indica that was discovered by a soldier who fought during
 the Soviet War in Afghanistan. This nameless soldier had strong anti-war sentiments,
 but had to fight regardless, and found solace in one interest he shared with some of the
 Afghan civilians he met – a love of good hashish. Before returning to the former USSR
 he made sure to collect seeds from his favorite plants in the region and brought them
 home. These seeds were passed on to Bomba Seeds who now offer them to the public.
    If grown outdoors, as nature intended, these plants become indica giants that reach
 heights of 10 to 13 feet with a classic wide leaf shape. A yield of 50 to 70 ounces per
 plant isn’t uncommon, and harvest time is early December to early January. The buds
 are heavy and the yield is large, so be prepared to stake your garden. Mazar likes the
 cold weather and is hardy, so growers can plant them outside and harvest them in De-
 cember despite the cold weather. These plants have been known to grow in the snow
                               and can survive even very brutal winter weather.
  Bomba Seeds, Ukraine             Mazar-i-Sharif has a pungent, intense aroma with

 PureBred Growers is a U.S.-based collective of breeding experts, and for this strain,
 the team has further developed a plant originally bred five years ago by the Rebel
 Lion Collective in California. A triple cross of Purple Urkle, Grape Ape and Granddaddy
 Purps, all members of the Blue family, Mendo Purp has been a favorite of growers
 and tokers alike since its release and has now been made into a Cali classic by Pure-
 Bred Growers.
    This plant isn’t fussy and enjoys being cultivated in both hydroponic and soil-based
 set ups. Your choice of medium dictates what exact colorings it produces; soilless grows
 giving a dark purple tinge and soil grows giving royal gold and purple hues with hardly
 any green. These gorgeous plants will grow between 2 and 3 feet and should finish fully
 in 9 to 10 weeks, and, unusually, don’t produce a higher yield if grown outdoors rather
 than indoors. Don’t use a bucket any larger than 5 gallons, as the root mass stays fairly
 small. The smell will be extremely strong in the last weeks of flowering, so be aware!

Montreal Chemo
 Trichome Pharm, based in Canada, comprises a group of licensed medical marijuana
 growers and breeders keen to make access to both quality product and accurate in-
 formation easier for those who need it. They are currently in the process of creating a
 research program with a view towards launching a database that plots different strains
 against the symptoms that they can help relieve. In the meantime, they have produced
 Montreal Chemo, which as the name suggests, is an original Canadian strain with very
 strong effects designed for medicinal users. Part of the celebrated Chemo family, Mon-
 treal Chemo has been popular in the Quebec cannabis community for almost 15 years.
 The strain is particularly noted for its pain management properties and strong appetite
 stimulation, and is one of the strains of choice for compassion societies.
    The genetic indica dominance is easy to see as soon as the plant enters the
 vegetative stage and begins to exhibit heavy stalks, hollow stems and the particular
 strength in structure that is not seen in sativa-dominant hybrids. Though the ro-
                                bustness of the plant means that it is able to grow in
  Trichome Pharm,               almost any scenario, it does produce especially well
  Canada                        when grown with the SOG technique. If this is not your
  Indica-Dominant               own choice of technique, Montreal Chemo will also
  Potency: THC 23%              produce well when allowed to grow into a slightly
  trichomepharm.com             larger plant, and as such, enjoys lots of room and a
                                slightly heavier feeding regime. These crops do tend
 to need a little more love than other indicas, and if not taken care of properly can
 be susceptible to pests and diseases.
    These plants respond very well to LST (low stress training), which tricks the plant
 into forming new growth along the flower stems to push new shoots out to reach the
 light. This basically involves pulling some of the more dominant shoots downwards, to
 make the plant forget that some of its tips are close to the light. To remedy this, it pushes
 other growth out towards the light, or creates new light-seeking stems. The mechanics
 of this technique are similar to that of topping, though the process is very different.
    Near harvest time, your Montreal Chemo buds will be coated with thick and oily
 resin, making it a great crop to produce hash from. Your grow room will be full of pine
 forest aromas just before harvest, and though your growing method of choice will af-
 fect the taste, you should notice earthy and fruity tones within the smoke. The resulting
 high is both heavy and narcotic, while remaining mellow. A great one for connoisseurs
 and medical patients.

Mr. Nice                          (G-13 x Hash Plant)
 Named after Howard Marks, a British hashish importer and one of the most prolific
 contemporary cannabis activists, this strain from Holland’s masters of breeding, Sensi
 Seeds, comprises some pretty serious genetics. While the male parent, Hash Plant,
 is a direct descendant of one of the best genotypes to come out of the Hindu Kush
 region, the female parent, G-13, is almost mythical, such is the legend surrounding
 its origins. It’s the story that every stoner will tell their kids, the one where the U.S.
 government breeds an ultra-potent strain only to have a cutting liberated by a weed-
                               loving lab technician, which then becomes the hottest
                               property amongst the counter-culture stoners. We’ll
                               never know the truth, but either way, the quality of G-13
                               has become famous in its own right, and its original pair-
                               ing with Hash Plant was available in limited edition
                               seeds in the 90s and was brought back to much cele-
                               bration by Sensi in 1999.
  Sensi Seeds, Holland             These days, Mr. Nice seeds give rise to solid crops
  Indica-Dominant              which won’t grow any taller than about 50 inches but can
  Genetics: G-13 x Hash        yield up to 100 grams of premium indica bud per plant.
  Plant                        Expect flowering in about 60 days and be sure not to
  Potency: THC 20%             overdose them in the earlier stages of growth – just let
  sensiseeds.com               them do their own thing! Also try not to over water the
                               plant as it’s simply unnecessary and can only damage
 your grow. These plants love a lot of light, and the more you give them, the more they
 will produce for you, but be careful that the leaf tips don’t get too close to the bulb or
 they’ll burn. With such dense buds, it’s imperative to ensure that ventilation in your
 grow room is sufficient, and humidity is kept at 40% or below during the second half
 of flowering, as stagnant, wet air can give rise to mold inside the colas. Invest in more
 fans to ensure a good flow of air if you think this is a concern in your set up, and keep
 an eye on the humidity at all times.
    Mr. Nice is a smoke for the heaviest of tokers, those who could take a whole cross-
 joint of Skunk without even batting an eyelid. The ‘double Afghani’ taste gives you the
 ultimate body stone and knocks you off your feet. Depending on your tolerance you
 might enjoy a few hours of lazy euphoria and a bit of couch lock, or you could lose all
 motor function and be totally macraméd to your chair. Either way, it’s not the best
 choice for a rookie smoker, but the experienced will love it.

Mt. Cook
 It doesn’t take a genius, or for that matter, a DEA detective, to figure out where Kiwi
 Seeds are based, even if they do operate from Holland. For this strain they’ve gone
 back to their roots, naming this mainly-indica hybrid after the highest mountain in New
 Zealand, Mount Cook – or Aoraki as the Maoris would call it. It’s not exclusively a Kiwi
 strain because it has an Afghani/Thai mother and a father that’s half Northern Lights
 and half Hash Plant, but as that gene pool sounds so promising, we won’t hold it
 against them!
    As is typical for such an indica-influenced hybrid, Mt. Cook plants grow beautiful
 dark green leaves on sturdy, thick branches, and give heavy buds when flowering
 rolls around at about the 50 day mark. However, these flowers are often so heavy
 that you will need to lend some extra support to the top branches and the cola. A
 stake will work just fine, or some growers like to use supportive netting to make their
 Mt. Cook plants really secure. Though there are a couple of phenotypes, the only real
                               difference is that one exhibits slightly more Thai traits
  Kiwi Seeds, Holland          and one shows slightly stronger Northern Lights traits;
  Indica-Dominant              both grow well in the same situations. Mt. Cook is well
  Genetics: Afghani/Thai x     suited to indoor grow rooms, and if you favor the SOG
  Northern Lights/Hash         technique this makes a good choice, though it does take
  Plant                        a little longer than some indicas to finish. Flowering
  Potency: THC 18%             should occur in 58 days or less. It also takes fantastically
  kiwiseeds.com                to a hydroponic or aeroponic set up, so if your budget is
                               large enough to accommodate the higher start up costs
 of a hydroponic grow, you could try an ebb and flow system with grow rocks as a
 medium. Mt. Cook plants can withstand relatively large doses of nutrients without suc-
 cumbing to nutrient burn, but as ever, be careful that you don’t get too carried away
 or all your hard work will be ruined. In hydroponic set ups especially, the need to en-
 sure proper environmental temperatures and nutrient levels is high. Your yield should
 be enhanced by a more technical set up, but even in a soil grow, yield should be along
 the lines of 450 grams per square yard.
    When smoked, these buds have a very earthy taste, crammed with rich flavor. It’s
 somewhat reminiscent of real Hash with a little more depth. The stone is just as seri-
 ous as the taste, with the high hitting heavily and immediately before mellowing out
 to a beautiful body stone with a heavy feeling appreciated most by those who enjoy
 a few hours of couch lock!

Northern Light Special
 Holland’s Spliff Seeds produces quality seeds and prides itself on offering fantastic
 customer service. With Northern Light Special, they have a new take on the legendary
 Northern Lights family. First bred in Seattle from a Californian plant, Northern Lights
 is a favorite amongst breeders due to its big, potent buds and fantastic resin produc-
 tion. This ancestor is a very heavy indica hybrid, and comes from a mix of Afghani,
 the famed ‘true’ indica, Hindu Kush, and Thai. Breeders should be aware that there
 are two phenotypes: one short and stalky with a compact bud structure and large fan
 leaves, and another that is reminiscent of a lemon skunk plant.
    As expected from a strain with such dominant indica genetics, Northern Light Spe-
 cial plants are short in stature and compact enough to make them great indoors. They
 are easy to control in a small grow room, but also produce a great yield for plants of
 their size, making them a good choice for those concerned with getting a big harvest
 from the smallest amount of grow space. They also grow well outside, where they
                               won’t grow as leggy or tall as some other plants, and
  Spliff Seeds, Holland        they aren’t too fussy about which type of fertilizers you
  Indica-Dominant              use on them. They can sometimes have a bit of a
  Genetics: Afghani x Hindu    stretch, but nothing that becomes too invasive on the
  Kush x Thai                  rest of your space. In fact, a Northern Light Special crop
  Potency: THC 18%             is said to be mostly headache-free in almost any envi-
  spliffseeds.nl               ronment. This makes them a particularly good choice for
                               a newbie grower who may not know what to do if their
 plant is plagued with botrytis or does not respond to nutrient feedings. Also, thanks to
 the parentage of Hindu Kush, which produces dense, compact buds covering the
 branches from stalk to tip, Northern Light Special is a huge resin producer and grows
 very quickly – a beautiful sight for the eyes of any grower!
    This plant has a Skunk-like smell, with an earthy honey musk odor, but tastes very
 sweet. The high is a buzzy, full-body stoned feeling that has smokers in Holland
 hooked. Due to this soothing high, medicinal marijuana users smoke Northern Light
 Special to relax and combat chronic pain. The warm buzz is like a giant hug with a
 tendency towards contemplative aftershocks. It can also result in a serious case of
 couch lock if you’re not too careful, so make sure the remote is within arm’s reach
 before you spark up. You can also use the buds to make hash oil to create canna-
 cookies or space brownies, both of which are fantastically potent – so be careful that
 you don’t get carried away and scarf the whole batch or you may never get up again.

Northern Skunk
 Peak Seeds of Canada is based in British Columbia and aims to bring integrity and a
 personal touch to the seed business, with an inspiring breeding motto of “Preserve
 the original, perfect the progeny.” Their Northern Skunk is the result of breeding the
 much-loved Northern Lights #5 from the BC Seed Company with Peak’s own Skunk
 male plant, to give a very potent strain that’s also easy to grow.
    The individual parent plants of Northern Skunk were chosen for their lateral branch-
 ing, stocky stature and low odor during the vegetative stage. All of these desirable
                               traits were preserved in the offspring. A short plant which
                               has flowers at about 8 weeks indoors, Northern Skunk
                               loves organic soil grows that are fortified with organic
                               fertilizers and responds particularly well to molasses in
                               the flowering stage. It can be finished in 9 weeks but if
                               you can wait until day 77 (you’ll be happy you did).

Obsession
 Spanish company World of Seeds is comprised of a multicultural group of horticultural
 and biology enthusiasts with an interest in cannabis. As well as operating a seed bank,
 the team works on original strains, one of which is Obsession, the name of which
 gives you a clue about how much this crew cares about producing high quality strains.
 After many years of crossbreeding, the World of Seeds experts were finally satisfied
 enough to release this one to the market. They took a plant which held the genetics
 of three amazing strains – White Rhino, Black Domina and Jack Herer – and crossed
 it with a Pakistani indica known as Gilgit Valley. Thanks to this mélange of pedigrees,
 Obsession quickly became a sensation among cannabis connoisseurs.
    Highly resistant to all pests and with a majority indica influence, Obsession is an
 ultra-stable strain. It is best suited to growing indoors, where it finishes fully in 9 weeks,
 but can also be grown outdoors when it should be ready at either the end of Septem-
 ber or the first week of October. The success of your outdoor grow will depend on
                                 your location, as Obsession doesn’t particularly enjoy

  Potency: THC 15-20%            and you’ll see some good growth and substantial flow-
  worldofseeds.com               ering. If your budget doesn’t extend to purchasing a
                                 massive amount of bulbs or LEDs, store-bought or
 homemade reflectors can be put to good use in this kind of situation, as they bounce
 the light into parts of the set up that might otherwise be relatively dark. Obsession
 crops are usually great yielders as they are very resilient, and work very well in mild
 climates. Be sure not to harvest your crop too early and you should find yourself with
 a respectable stash of some delightful buds with a great aroma.
    Flavorsome and very fragrant, Obsession buds might leave you totally devoted to
 them like an emotional lover thanks to their mouthwatering smell and wholesome
 taste. Once the pleasure of the taste subsides, the chilled-out high will take a gentle
 hold of you and cradle you into submission. A good choice for social smoking, the
 buzz won’t leave you incapacitated or overly introspective. This strain is well-suited
 to medicinal users thanks to its mellow but relaxing high which is a great elevator of
 mood and so combats depression.

 OtherSide Farms is a medical marijuana information center in the USA that dispenses
 education about cannabis as well as how to grow. The team is extremely passionate
 about providing professional and high quality products, and this commitment shines
 through in this original strain. Olivia Kush is an indica-dominant mix of the Hindu Kush
 and Skunk lines, the latter of which is known for its vigorous growth and potent high.
    These short plants are very hardy and begin to look extremely bushy towards the
 end of the vegetative stage. Olivia Kush is more than happy in an organic soil-based
                               grow, and given good quality soil and the right amount
                               of feeding, can be a fantastic yielder. She isn’t fussy and

P-91
 Stoney Girl Gardens is the philanthropic mission of a socially conscious group of card-
 holding legal growers of medical marijuana who have been operating in Oregon since
 1999. Stoney Girl Gardens is passionate about creating true breeding strains and pro-
 viding 100% organic seeds, with a master breeder who’s been in the game for over 40
 years. The company even provides free growing classes, such is their dedication to
 the cause, and their P-91 strain is a classic for those who need a heavy-duty medicinal
 plant. The genetics are somewhat mysterious, as the original seeds were obtained
 from a university professor who had first bred them. As the ‘new G-13,’ this supposedly
 came from a government-sponsored breeding program at a University in Southern
 California that is so top secret that, for all intents and purposes, it doesn’t exist. The
 story goes that the professor handed the seeds over to Stoney Girl in exchange for
 some of its Berkeley Blues seeds, and that this strain became a great addition to their
 breeding program, giving rise to their Pit Bull and Hog’s Breath families, among others.
                                   Happily grown either indoors or outdoors, P-91 has
  Stoney Girl Gardens,         a lot of energy and bursts into life very quickly. She’s
  USA                          easy to grow right through to harvest, and will grow to
  Indica-Dominant              between 4 and 6 feet tall. Her favorite temperatures are
  Potency: THC 28%             those of Cali and if you can keep her in conditions be-
  gro4me.com                   tween 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit she’ll be seriously
                               stoked. If you obtain these seeds to start your own me-
 dicinal garden, you’ll be pleased to hear that she’s an easy one to clone, with the
 clones taking quickly and easily once planted. Flowering lasts around 40 days and
 just before you chop your plants you’ll see huge, deep green leaves with bud that’s
 accordingly massive. The flowers are very tight and heavy and, if you grow outside,
 you’ll see a lot of pure pink hairs on the already-beautiful nugs.
    It should serve as a warning to all potential recreational smokers of P-91 that this
 strain is massively potent. As with most pain-killing strains, this will put you out com-
 pletely and therefore is not for use any time other than before bed. The intention of
 breeding P-91 was to offer a much-needed respite for those suffering most: HIV/AIDS
 patients, cancer patients, extreme addicts, sufferers of severe pain and terminal pa-
 tients. As such, the stone hits very rapidly and lasts for a long time. The smoke tastes
 musky and dense, with hints of grapefruit and spice, and gives an almost immediate
 couch lock effect. This is effective enough to be recognized by doctors as a morphine
 replacement treatment, so be very wary before you toke.

Peace Maker
 If you’re actively involved in the cannabis community you’ll be familiar with Treating
 Yourself magazine, a publication launched to promote the responsible use of med-
 ical marijuana. Finest Medicinal Seeds, the publishers of this fine mag, also run a
 seed bank from their base in Canada, and one of their strains is the famous Peace
 Maker from the 90s. Bred in Holland, this combination of Super Skunk and White
 Widow is a hybrid with Indian and Brazilian heritage, as well as a genetic link to the
 formidable Skunk #1.
    The name Peace Maker has become synonymous with big yields, short flowering
 times and great taste. The plant has a short and steady internode with a bushy
 buildup and short, strong branches. One of the most distinctive traits of this strain
 is the sharp, serrated profile of its leaves that may remind you of sharks’ teeth. It’s
 best to grow Peace Maker in a hydroponic system, specifically an open system
 using rockwool flakes with no recycling of water, to achieve its maximum yield and
                               potency. If you’re more interested in cultivating the best
  Finest Medicinal Seeds,      possible taste, give soil a go, and even think about
  Canada                       using organic fertilizers and nutrients. The vegetative
  Indica-Dominant              stage should last around 36 to 40 days, and consider
  Genetics: Super Skunk x      that, while 8 weeks is the general harvest point, leaving
  White Widow                  the crop for an extra week will increase the potency
  Potency: THC 17%             and sweetness of the extra-heavy buds. Despite the
  finestmedicinalseeds.com     weight of these, staking shouldn’t be necessary thanks
                               to the strength of the plant itself. Resin will start to form
 in the third week of flowering and peak at 8 weeks. This will make for an extra sticky
 harvest, so be sure to wear gloves and cover your eyes when you’re chopping. Fail-
 ing to do so can result in a horribly powerful contact high and, should you wipe your
 eyes with resin-covered hands, you find yourself not only with a stinging face but
 also suffering from the worst kind of red eye.
    The taste of Peace Maker is reminiscent of summer fruits with a candy aftertaste.
 When ripened for that little extra time, a hint of spice is added to this mix making for
 a spectacularly layered flavor. These older buds will give a very heavy stoned feeling
 that lasts a long time and gives great respite from MS and arthritis. Even the younger
 nugs deliver a decent punch and a full-body muted buzz that will make it near-impos-
 sible to tap dance around the room but should leave you in the right mood for good
 company and a funny movie.

Pennsylvania Purple
 Pennsylvania Purple is an underground strain circulating on the East Coast that is
 producing quite a lot of buzz both locally and internationally through word of mouth
 and online forums. Pennsylvania Purple is currently only available in the USA, but
 the breeders, who prefer to remain anonymous due to the draconian laws of their
 home states, are planning to tissue culture this cultivar in the hopes of making it more
 commercially available. For now, just remember that if you get the chance to buy a
                               clone of this beauty or to take a puff on some of her
                               buds, take it. She’s a great plant.
                                  Produced by a collective of East Coast growers,
                               Pennsylvania Purple is a 30% sativa and 70% indica
                               strain that grows well indoors and outdoors. Outdoor
                               growers can expect a dark purple coloration to appear
                               naturally as temperatures drop and the plant matures.
                               To get purple colors indoors, use Purple Maxx (foliar)
                               nutrients, although a drop in grow room temperature can
  Unknown East Coast           also induce darker purple colors. Pennsylvania Purple
  Grower, USA                  likes the cold temperatures of her home state, grows to
  Indica-Dominant              about 4 feet tall, and works well in SOG set ups. She
  Potency: THC 17%             can also do very well in hydro grow rooms and in soil
                               gardens, though amending the soil before you plant the
 seedlings can give her a great springboard to start from. As tempting as it is to shower
 these darlings with the best nutrients on the market, don’t go mad or you’ll ruin her
 natural beauty with nute burn. Expect a flowering time of 60 days and a time of 72 to
 75 days for her to ripen after forced flowering with a moderate yield. Quality not quan-
 tity is the name of the game when growing Pennsylvania Purple and although the
 yield is low, even a handful of cured, dried nugs will have the most hardened toker
 weeping with joy. Bud this beautiful is always in high demand so if you get a hold of
 any seeds, you can land yourself a very lucrative crop.
    Pennsylvania Purple has a smooth, fruity and sweet taste that has delicious tones
 of grape, as is common with purple plants. The high is clear, physically relaxing, and
 evenly matched between the mind and body, allowing users to chill out and be creative
 while they are stoned. Artists especially will appreciate this kind of high. The breeder
 recommends flushing the plant during the last 10 days of flowering with half a tea-
 spoon of molasses per gallon of water to encourage a healthy, great tasting harvest.

Pinkbud
 Secret Garden Seeds has broken new ground with Pinkbud: an auto-flowering SOG-
 specific strain, something not seen regularly in the expansive cannabis market. This
 strain was the company’s first attempt at making a colorful variety that met these cri-
 teria, and to do so, they used a three-way hybrid of LowAsis, M. JEMS and Diesel
 Ryder. This crossing increased the flavor of LowAsis and preserved the beautiful col-
 oring traits that JEMS are known for.
    Pinkbud plants have it all: large colorful buds from JEMS, heavy resin production
 from Diesel Ryder, and the great flavor of LowAsis. Plants are very uniform, which is a
                               must for any auto-flowering SOG system. The plants av-
                               erage at about 20 inches in height, have a distinct main
                               cola dominance and limited branching. Planting at 4 plants
                               per square foot yields an impressive canopy of large buds,
                               with beautiful pink, purple, red, and green colors. Despite
                               being formulated for a SOG set up, the plants also do well
  Secret Garden Seeds,         outdoors thanks to their resistance to mold and frost.
  UK                              The smoke of Pinkbud is light and pleasant, and the

                          Supreme Beans is a Hawaii-based breeder dedicated to finding the best plants of the

                          cannabis community. Puna Blue is a strain that was given to him by a grower from
                          Hawaii’s Big Island with unknown genetics, but the name may hint at some relation
                          to another Hawaiian strain, Puna Budder from TH Seeds, as well as some heritage
                          that may include DJ Short’s famous Blueberry. We can be sure, however, that PB is
                          a 75/25 indica-sativa hybrid with all the quality typical of the plants from the islands.
                             This plant tends to grow with one huge main cola rather than several smaller
                          ones, and as is the case with most Blue plants, has a hefty density. It also grows
                          quite quickly with especially fast flowering, which can be expected at around 8

Purple Pineberry
 Canada’s Secret Valley Seeds knows what is important to commercial growers, and
 produces strains bred from only the best of their seed stash, that deliver these sought-
 after traits. While their Hardcore and Top Dollar plants are quick-flowering and high-
 yielding to allow for very productive grow rooms, Purple Pineberry is a little more deep
 in its purpose. Though its history is either cloaked in secrecy or genuinely unknown
 to the breeders, we can be sure that it is an indica-dominant hybrid with some definite
 resilience in growing.
    Purple Pineberry is a hardy plant that flowers quickly and braves humid Canadian
 summers well thanks to its resistance to mold. When flowering comes around, it will
 produce chunky, solid buds that exude a great aroma of pine. These can be harvested
 after 6 weeks indoors, or around September 20th in an outdoor garden.
    Purple Pineberry buds have a very distinctive smell and can give rise to a harsh
 but lightly sweet smoke. It has a very pleasant mellow high which is energizing and
                               won’t pull your energy levels down. Secret Valley Seeds

                              Red Flame Kush is SinsemillaWorks’ latest indica strain. The team of breeders has
                              crossed a Purple Kush female with a Blue Moonshine male to make a killer hybrid
                              and are currently pollinating and testing it with a strong indica plant. They will have a

Redd Cross
 Genetics Gone Madd is a medical cooperative operating out of the US, working on
 new strains to offer the highs that their customers need. The late Dan Christensen, a
 passionate GGM breeder who unfortunately passed away recently, did much of the
 development of Redd Cross, which comprises genes of an unknown Afghani indica
 and the almost equally enigmatic Spirit of 76, apparently one of the first strains grown
 on the hills of California.
    Named via one of GGM’s strain-naming competitions, Redd Cross seeds grow
 into very compact plants that should not be topped, as this could result in overcrowd-
 ing of the colas. Laborious efforts to breed structural integrity into the plants has re-
 sulted in a sturdy, solid trunk and branches, which should eliminate the need for any
 sort of containment to shoulder the weight of her heavy top. Also be sure not to over
 water your crop, as Redd Cross is drought and cold tolerant but can get flooded easily.
    Expect to harvest after 60 days indoor, or the first week of September if exposed
                               to the sun, and after a few weeks of curing kick back

Sannie’s Herijuana IBL
 Holland’s Sannie’s Seeds are dedicated to producing quality strains for the
 cannabis connoisseur, and have definitely hit the nail on the head with this strain.
 Sannie’s Herijuana IBL, originated from Canada’s Woodhorse Seeds and was per-
 fected by noted breeder Motarebel. This plant was created from a 2006 batch of
 seeds through years of selecting the best phenotypes, backcrossing them and then
 breeding them with the company’s original mother plant. This has given rise to a
 highly stabile and sought-after plant, much like Motarebel’s other noted strains Star
                              Kush and White Molokai.
                                 Herijuana is an extremely popular strain throughout
                              the cannabis community because of its fast growing
                              pattern and desirable branching. Despite exhibiting a
                              development more typical of a sativa-dominant plant,
                              this strain blooms like an indica with vigorous branch-
                              ing that makes it very suitable for a ScrOG set up. Your
  Sannie’s Seeds, Holland     Herijuana IBL plants should be ready to move into the
  Indica-Dominant             flowering stage around the 8 week mark, and a mini-
  Genetics: Killer New        mum vegetative cycle of 6 weeks is recommended for
  Haven Strain x Petrolia     optimum yield. The plant continues to grow for a cou-
  Headstash                   ple of weeks into the flowering cycle and begins to
  Potency: THC 20-25%         form golf-ball shaped buds that are as beautiful as
  sanniesshop.com             they are dense. These will be rock hard by the last few
                              weeks of flowering and, thanks to the wide internodal
 spacing, produce tons of resin. As ever, be sure to exercise caution when harvest
 comes around, as dealing with such resinous plants can bring on a ridiculously
 strong contact high; gloves and goggles are always recommended. The plants
 shouldn’t grow beyond 4.5 feet in height but will yield between 400 and 500 grams
 per square yard of grow room.
    The taste of this strain is delightful, as it contains hints of both dark coffee and
 wood, and the stone is just as good: an intense, narcotic couch lock high that pulls
 down on the eyelids. Smokers who are new to the scene should exercise caution, as
 this is an extremely potent strain, and can take even a daily toker by surprise. It’s
 known as a one-hit-wonder, and not because it had a popular song and some fleeting
 fame in the 80s; just a few puffs of this can lay you right out. Just take it easy and
 enjoy the feeling. Remember, you don’t have to smoke it all at once!

SDOGnesia
 Ultimate Seeds is a fairly young seed bank offering the top strains, including great
 originals. For this exclusive strain, Ultimate has raised the bar for great genetics. The
 previously popular Sour Diesel x OG Kush cross was brought back to life, and brought
 with it an expansive family tree that includes 1991 Chemdawg, Northern Lights, Super
 Skunk, Hawaiian, Diesel, OG Kush and Lemon Thai. That makes one mean family
 gathering even before you consider that this plant was then married to Ultimate Seeds’
 favorite Amnesia Haze cut. The award-winning and exotic Amnesia Haze is of Laotian,
 Hawaiian and Jamaican heritage, and is known to give an intense, lingering body
 buzz that has made it the choice of many heavy smokers. Given this rich gene pool,
 it’s easy to see why SDOGnesia is regarded as such a high-quality strain.
    As is often the case with a young strain that hasn’t yet been fully stabilized, there
 are many phenotypes of SDOGnesia, exhibiting a variety of traits. However, all of
 these phenotypes produce plants that are extremely shiny, as if always wet. This is
                               due to the huge trichome production and should be
  Ultimate Seeds               cause for celebration rather than concern! This also
  Indica-Dominant              means that the plant is extremely sticky, so caution
  Genetics: Sour Diesel x      should be used when harvesting or trimming, as a mas-
  OG Kush x Amnesia Haze       sive and unpleasant contact high can result from over-
  Potency: THC 21%             handling. SDOGnesia is a relatively quick finisher, and
  ultimateseeds.com            flowers in 8 to 10 weeks depending on how and where
                               you choose to grow your crop. Just before harvest
 you’ll be treated to a lingering, sweet aroma from your grow room. Once chopped,
 these buds will mature with an even more delicious smell. Your yield should be a
 heavy one, especially if the plant is grown outside where it has more room to spread
 its roots. Be aware of the risk of powdery mildew and make sure to take action at
 any sign of it taking hold.
    The experience of smoking this strain has been likened to ‘talking to God’: a brave
 and bold claim, you might think. Parent plant Amnesia Haze is known to bring on a
 psychedelic, trippy high, and it could be this influence that leads the smoker into a
 state much like conversing with the ultimate deity. However we could also attribute
 this to the cerebral relaxation of the Sour Diesel, or the zombie-making super stone
 of OG Kush. Wherever it comes from, the high is a delightful one, leaving you positive,
 stimulated and chilled out all at the same time. The taste is layered and has both floral
 and oily undertones, and makes SDOGnesia a total joy to smoke.

Sensi Star
 Paradise Seeds, one of the most notable Amsterdam seed companies, has released
 some fantastic original strains in the last decade or so, and one of these is their well-
 known Sensi Star. The family history of this plant is unknown, but it is an indica-dominant
 hybrid that has earned a great reputation since it was introduced to the market in 1995.
    Having won many awards over the years, this diva has a lot to live up to. She does
 so by producing solid, dense colas that are extremely compact and drenched in frosty
 resin. A great plant to choose for an indoor grow, Sensi Star works particularly well in
 a SOG set up with 20 plants per square yard, potted closely together. Hydroponic
 and soil grows also suit her needs, though if you let her grow outside expect a huge
 plant of about 6.5 feet in height with very strong side branching. Indoors, you should
 let the vegetative stage run for 2 weeks before changing to a 12 on/12 off light cycle,
 and you’ll be rewarded with very dark green fan leaves and weighty buds.
    The citrusy-metallic scent of the nugs gives a fantastically dense smoke that de-
                                volves into a body-hitting stone that some note has
  Paradise Seeds, Holland       added cerebral effects. Whether or not you feel the head
  Indica-Dominant               high is more or less irrelevant, as you will be consumed

Shiesel
 Bonguru Beans is a well-established Dutch seed company specializing in high quality
 niche genetics, such as their celebrated strain, Shiesel. By crossing a special cut of
 Shiva with a renowned New York City Diesel, the breeders at Bonguru Beans have
 created one hell of a plant. The Shiva adds a significant amount of potency to the
 NYC Diesel and the buds retain the floral bouquet with an extra hint of fruitiness from
 the Diesel parent. Shiesel is an F1 and subsequently shows the distinct differences
 of the parent strains in the phenotypes that are produced.
    Growing this strain can be a challenge, both indoors and outdoors, but while be-
 ginners can find Shiesel to be a tough plant to grow, advanced cultivators enjoy the
 challenge and love this beauty because the rewards are so sweet. Flowering time is
 between 8 and 10 weeks with a decent yield if tended to properly. The breeder rec-
 ommends that seeds be germinated by soaking overnight and then planted directly
 into small pots at a depth of ¼ inch. Be careful not to overwater and be sure to veg-
                              etate the plant until it has between 4 and 7 internodes.
  Bonguru Beans, Holland          Shiesel is a fruity, exotic-smelling plant with a firm,
  Indica-Dominant             hashy taste. The stone is very indica-influenced, with

Sour Grapes
 Having been growing cannabis since the early 90s, the breeders behind Apothecary
 Genetics have conducted years of research and development to create strains that
 are perfect for medical marijuana users like themselves. Sour Grapes is a cross
 made from two of Apothecary’s own breeding strains, the celebrated Grape Ape,
 known for its fast finishing time and great taste, and the popular Sour Diesel, known
 for its great yields.
    This strain is happy in any environment, but is not particularly suitable for a SOG
 technique. The plants enjoy having their own space and will reward you with an in-
 creased yield if you supply them with adequate feeding and sufficient space to grow.
 Sour Grapes is an even quicker plant than its Grape Ape parent, and should be fully
 finished in 7 or 8 weeks. If you’re growing outside, be ready for harvest in late October.
    Sour Grapes was created to be potent enough to help medical users while still

Starbud
 Another small but serious young seed company based in the Netherlands, HortiLab
 uses primarily European and North American cannabis genetics to breed new-school
 strains, with the main goals of premium flavor, potency and yield. As yet they have
 four original breeds available, and of these four, two have won notable awards, indi-
 cating an up-and-coming company with a big future. One of these award-winners is
 their most prominent indica-heavy strain, StarBud, which was an underground legend
 in the US. The present-day StarBud is a clone from a private grower’s seed line, com-
 ing from the U.S. midwest.
    Named for its buds, so covered in resin that they “sparkle like stars”, StarBud
 plants have an average indica stretch, and though indoors is the best situation for
 this plant, it can thrive well in outdoor grows in California and similar climates. How-
 ever, high humidity should be avoided when grown inside, as the compact buds can
 give way to mold if the air is too wet. Be sure to keep the trim after harvest, as it can
                               make great hash. StarBud seeds are fairly new to the
  HortiLab Seed Company,       market, so you might struggle to find grow reports to

Sweet Chunk
 Switzerland’s Alpine Seeds consistently impresses the community with its quality ge-
 netics and highly stabilized, niche strains. Sweet Chunk, a stunning cross of Sweet
 Pink Grapefruit and a Deep Chunk IBL, is no different. The indica dominance of this
 plant stems from its heritage, as Deep Chunk is a Pakistani/Aghani hybrid, and SPG
 is an old Northern Lights #1 phenotype. Breeders love this strain as it is not a poly-
 hybrid, and the Deep Chunk parent has dominated the cross, giving these plants per-
 fectly homogenized and stabilized growth patterns.
    These plants give hard and compact nuggets and a yield of around 30 to 40
 grams each if grown to 32 inches. Sweet Chunk clones take just 10 days to root, so
 if you find one you like, it’s easy to keep her as a mother plant. Plants are mold and
 spider mite resistant, but be sure to use a minimum of 2 to 4 weeks of light at 18
 on/6 off to ensure healthy growth. This plant is not compatible with maxi-cropping
 or any cutting of the stalk prior to harvest.
                                   Expect a munchies-inducing couch lock to hit you
  Alpine Seeds,                 hard and fast, but this is offset by the mild uplifting buzz
  Switzerland                   that sets in after a little while. The SPG heritage means
  Indica-Dominant               that Sweet Chunk tastes and smells of grapefruit, with

Tahoe Gold
 Master Thai Seeds is a solid independent breeder from North America, and has over
 35 years experience growing with organics. Tahoe Gold is one of his best strains. A
 50/50 indica/sativa strain, this has the genes of a real 1968 Skunk #1 straight from
 the breeders of Cali which was bred with a Hindu Kush grown from seed, circa 1975.
    A versatile plant which can adapt well to any grow method, this plant is like the tor-
 toise rather than the hare; it starts off slowly but before you know it, it’ll be growing full
 steam ahead and surpassing other strains at the end of the flowering stage. Tahoe Gold
 tends to spread its branches out around a large central bud, staying fairly short through-
 out its whole life, and for this reason, is a good choice if you’re working with a SOG set
 up. Finishing times range from 62 days indoors, through 65 days in a greenhouse, to a
 full 72-day cycle if you place them outside, with a harvest in October. Expect to yield
 around 100 grams per plant if you’re growing indoors with 1000 watts of light.
    Grown for the medicinal user, Tahoe Gold relaxes the body and prompts a pos-
                                 itive state of mind while leaving the smoker still able to

  Indica-Dominant                much harder if cooked into edibles. Carrying a sweet

Taiga
 Holland’s Dutch Passion have been big players in the scene since their inception in
 1987, and now stand as one of the oldest and most well-known seed companies.
 Taiga, along with Tundra, was one of the first Dutch Passion auto-flowering strains
 released to the market in early 2009, and their success and popularity led the com-
 pany to develop their new AutoFem strain line. The ruderalis line which gives this
 range its auto-flowering trait can all be traced back to plants obtained from the North-
 ern latitudes in Russia and Canada. To create Taiga, the breeders at Dutch Passion
 took the pollen from an extremely early-flowering male Power Plant and fertilized the
 female ruderalis/indica cross.
    With usual ruderalis resilience, Taiga does not ask for a special fertilizing regime,
 which means that it’s easy to grow and can thrive almost anywhere. As the plants
 never grow huge, with a maximum height of about 24 inches, containers of 1.5 to 2
 liters are sufficient to guarantee a good harvest, but for a good quality yield, the plants
                                will need a place with a lot of sunlight. If given this, she
  Dutch Passion, Holland        will reward you with big, compact buds in less than 10
  Indica-Dominant               weeks. Under artificial light, 18 hours of light during 2 to
  Genetics: Auto-flowering      2.5 months is fine to ensure a decent harvest. As neither
  Ruderalis/Indica x Power      the fertilizing nor the light cycles need a lot of attention,
  Plant                         with Taiga you can dedicate yourself to ensuring that she
  dutch-passion.nl              has plenty of grow space under your bulbs, that each
                                flowering part of the plant has access to that light, and
 that no pests or diseases even have a chance of taking hold. Ladybugs, spider mites
 and aphids can all create problems that quickly become serious and can effectively
 kill half your crop. The dreaded botrytis is probably the main disease to look out for,
 as this grey mold loves humid rooms that are lacking in good ventilation. The only
 way to treat this is to remove every single part of the plant that has been touched by
 it, meaning that your vigorous, bushy plant can quickly end up as a spindly, pathetic
 wreck. With the correct protection and action against these problems, however, you
 should find Taiga a hassle-free strain to grow, and one that’s particularly great if you’re
 new to growing your own pot or are an industrial grower without a lot of time to tend
 to each individual plant in your massive garden.
    Taiga buds carry a soft smoke with a cozy body stone and a very pleasant emo-
 tional warmth, but won’t put you out for too long. The smoke is very reminiscent of
 Power Plant, with a sharp taste.

Taleggio
 America’s Alphakronik Genes already has some fantastic strains to its name and this
 brand new indica-dominant plant won’t let down its already stellar reputation. Re-
 leased to the public on St Patrick’s day in 2011, Taleggio is named after a particularly
 pungent and fruity type of Italian cheese in order to give a cheeky nod to its Exodus
 Cheese parent plant. Exodus Cheese is a UK strain known for its strong, creeping
 high, and is paired with the phenomenal Space Queen in this great new strain.
    Taleggio is said to surpass even the most aromatic of Cheese strains, so odor control
 must be your biggest priority when growing this lady, especially when she enters the
 flowering stage. There are a couple of phenotypes that vary slightly, but Taleggio plants
 will not have much stretch, being predominantly short and bushy. Finishing in 55 to 65
 days, she’s a medium yielder, but with Taleggio it’s is all about taste and potency.
    Prepare yourself for a deliciously overwhelming attack on the taste buds when you
 light up a Taleggio bowl! An abundance of flavors from blueberry and vanilla to straw-

Taskenti
 CannaBioGen is a very well-respected cannabis collective that currently operates
 out of Spain. The team is serious about its work and has a well-deserved and ex-
 cellent reputation for reliable genetics. Taking a more scientific approach to cannabis
 research and development they have several incredible original strains that are pop-
 ular with connoisseur growers, breeders and tokers. Taskenti is a pure indica that
 originated in Uzbekistan, but CannaBioGen worked hard to stabilize the most valu-
 able traits of the plant to make it suitable for a variety of grow situations in the West-
 ern world.
    This strain tends to vegetate quickly and looks like your archetypal indica plant.
 With heavy branching, very deep green leaves and big, fat buds, it is the bulldog of
 the growing world and is certainly not to be messed with, taking to soil particularly
 well and scaring off pests before they get their nasty little teeth into it. However, a
 little tenderness also goes a long way, and aeroponic systems allow Taskenti to bloom
 beautifully. This strain flowers without too much effort, and is a good plant if you’re
                                planning on an early harvest as it doesn’t need the extra
  CannaBioGen, Spain            couple of weeks for flowering that some strains prefer.
  Pure Indica                   The vegetative stage should last for a bare minimum of
  Genetics: Uzbekistani         30 days, with plants maturing fully in 7 to 9 weeks. En-
  cannabiogen.com               sure that the atmosphere in your grow room is well-ven-
                                tilated and dry, particularly during the flowering period.
 For an even greater yield you can grow Taskenti outdoors and it is especially well-
 suited to climates similar to those of the mountains of southern Spain. If so, plan to
 harvest in October. Always a good choice for a novice grower, Taskenti can withstand
 many typical newbie mistakes.
    Your resulting Taskenti bud will be noticeably heavier than many other types and
 does not have the overpowering stench that you might expect. A little trimming will be
 necessary, as these nugs often contain more leaves than other strains, but putting in
 a little effort to beautify your bud will definitely be worthwhile. The tight buds will burn
 quickly and smoothly if cured properly, which is a pleasure to see. The thick smoke is
 a bit of a cougher, but gives you a nice full feeling giving way to a serious but mellow
 high that leaves you with no hangover the next day. It does taste good, and as you’ll
 feel amazing the in the morning too it’s very tempting to hit the pipe again the next
 day with more and more, but try to pace yourself in working through your stash, as
 you’ll find yourself dozing if you go over the top.

The Happy Brother BX2
 Karma Genetics are British breeders operating from Maastricht in the Netherlands.
 The tale goes that this strain originates from a private grower, a Rasta from Amster-
 dam, who was growing to medicate his paralyzed brother. Karma got a hold of some
 clones in the late 90s, worked hard with several other plants, struggling to get a stable
 offspring, until ChemDawg came through to produce The Happy Brother BX2.
    The Happy Brother BX2 is known to produce decent buds under even a small
 amount of light, Just 400 watts can stimulate enough growth to please any grower,
 breeder or smoker. It won’t be a large yielder, but the buds you do get will be hefty,
                               and don’t shrink when dried. Your crop will be stocky, with
                               thick branching and wide leaves, making it unnecessary

                               stage. They should finish anywhere between 9 and 11
                               weeks, depending on your lighting cycles or the climate.
                                  Karma says that this strain is all about the taste, and
  Karma Genetics, Holland      he’s right; the smoke is smooth and the taste is multi-

 Eva Female Seeds is a Spanish seed company with a variety of excellent strains that
 are popular throughout Europe and the rest of the world. TNT Kush is a well-respected
 variety that was carefully selected from seeds brought to Spain from the mountains
 of Pakistan. TNT Kush is a landrace Pakistani, and has been carefully backcrossed
 for years in order to create a highly reliable and potent strain.
    If you get your hands on some TNT Kush seeds, you’ll be pleased to see that, like
 all Pakistani indicas, she produces large numbers of trichomes and hard, compact
 buds. Though this is a great sight for any grower, it does means that you need to
 stake your plants carefully, and avoid touching the buds too much before harvest.
 TNT Kush is very easy to grow, especially in nitrogen-poor soils, and requires very
 few nutrients to thrive. The plant flowers in 55 to 60 days, indoors and out. Expect
 long shoots during outdoor grows. Indoor growers should keep the temperature high
 during flowering to promote bigger, more resinous buds.
                                  Expect a nutty smell with hints of fruit and cypress

Tony’s Superfrosty
 California’s Redstar Farms is a collective dedicated to producing strains that ease the
 PTSD and trauma of disabled veterans and medical users. Tony’s Superfrosty is an
 original strain born of Blackberry Kush, 98 Bubba Kush and Afghan lineage, and as
 such is a strong indica-dominant variety with heavy Kush features and the type of
 stone that will give respite to those it’s intended for. Bubba Kush in particular is con-
 sidered by many to be one of the best current strains, and adding Blackberry and
 Afghani genetics to the mix means that this is one serious strain.
    Tony’s Superfrosty grows well in both soil and hydroponic set ups, and can be hap-
 pily cultivated indoors or out. You can expect a finishing time of around 9 weeks, with
 a significant yield. Due to the strong indica influence, these plants will be short and
 strong, with extremely sturdy branches. They respond well to topping and are very
 forgiving to any mistakes you might make.
    The quality of the amazingly resinous nugs you harvest will make up for a yield
                               that is smaller than that of others indicas. The sweet

Towerful
 Spain’s Tropical Seeds Company has taken advantage of their subtropical location
 and amazing climate to grow and breed all year round, allowing for huge leaps forward
 in the few years that the company has been in business. To create Towerful, they’ve
 used their own pure sativa Congo Pointe Noir, a company favorite, and a Chitral Kush
 from Pakistan, resulting in a pretty spectacular indica-dominant hybrid.
    Despite such fantastic sativa genetics, Towerful grows like a pure indica – exhibiting
 strong stems and branches with dark, wide leaves. Its tendency to form just one solid
 top cola makes it ideal for high-density indoor grows. The flowering period of this strain
 lies between 60 and 65 days, during which time you’ll see big white buds appear, with
 a high calyx-to-leaf ratio that will leave you itching to harvest! In time, purple shades
 will also come through, along with woody aromas of hash. While your bud will smell
 good enough to smoke right after it’s dried, a longer curing process will only enhance
 the fragrance, taste and potency of Towerful, so leave it as long as you can!
                                   This strain is a very quick hitter, and even while

Whitaker Blues
 JD Short, son of the famous DJ Short’s, has done his family proud with this fantastic
 indica-dominant strain. This is a true Oregon heritage cross that connoisseurs and
 new tokers alike will adore. The mother of Whitaker Blues is a plant referred to as
 “Quimby” – an old-school, West Coast cut that is reminiscent of a classic, early indica
 lineage with a strong, sleepy effect on the smoker. The Quimby mother was crossed
 with DJ Short’s personally selected Blueberry father, making Whitaker Blues 80% in-
 dica and 20% sativa in structure.
    Whitaker Blues is a stout hybrid with short branching structures and large, compact
 buds that are loaded with resin. Be sure to check the buds for mold, as their density
 can give rise to the warmth that mold loves. Growers like this plant’s vigor, productivity,
 and fantastic violet and blue coloration. This plant finishes in 55 to 62 days and can
 be grown indoors or outdoors as in Sarah’s accompanying photographs.
    Finished buds have a pungent/sweet velvety grape flavor with undertones of

White Russian
 White Russian from Holland’s Serious Seeds is an indica-dominant plant with some im-
 pressive parental genetics. White Russian is a stable cross of AK-47 and a prize-winning
 White Widow clone. Because of the AK-47 genetics, White Russian contains Colom-
 bian, Mexican, Thai and Afghani genetics, making its background remarkably vibrant
 and consistently reliable. The quality, consistency and potency of both AK-47 and White
 Widow have been maintained in this plant, making it a fantastic addition to any garden.
    White Russian grows to a medium height and produces consistent, dense and
 resinous flower tops with crystals appearing after about five weeks of flowering. Be
 sure to have a good air filtration system as the plants are strong smelling during both
 their vegetative and flowering period. This is known as one of the most potent strains
 available, so be careful that you don’t get a contact high from the highly resinous buds.
    The high is strong, long lasting and is quite cerebral due to the AK-47’s sativa influ-
 ences. White Russian is a great medicinal plant with excellent attributes from both of
                               its parent plants, including a smooth taste and strong
  Serious Seeds, Holland       high. This plant has great bag appeal because of its super
  Indica-Dominant              pungent aroma and consistent bud shape and texture.
  Genetics: AK-47 x White      Bear in mind that AK-47 is known as a ‘one hit wonder’

                     Working out of the USA, Reserva Privada is a collective of West Coast breeders that
                     strives to fashion fantastic and innovative strains for use in the community. Although
                     protected by medical growing laws in their home state, these breeders prefer to re-
                     main nameless. One of their great strains is a pure indica with Pakistani landrace ge-
                     netics known as X-18 Pure Pakistani. This is testament to the workability of the true
                     Pakistani line, and the quality of X-18 proves the strength of true Hindu Kush plants.
                        Though this plant is an indica through and through, the landrace influence means
                     that its growing pattern may be much different than you’re used to with indica/sativa
                     hybrids. You’ll definitely spot the fat, intensely green leaves to which you’ve become
                     accustomed as an indica grower but once you reach the first few weeks of the flowering
                     stage, you’ll see the typical Pakistani stretch that makes your plants look much differ-
                     ent. With steady growth throughout its lifespan, this isn’t a particularly fast-flowering
                     plant but it should be fully finished in 8 to 9 weeks. In flower, its aroma becomes es-
                                                      pecially pungent and when you get a whiff of the cheese
                      Reserva Privada, USA            and chorizo smell you’ll be looking around for your room-
                      Pure Indica                     mate’s leftover pizza, and might get a shock to find that
                      Genetics: Pakistani             that strangely delicious odor is actually emanating from
                      Indica                          your plants. This might also be an asset in the security
                      dnagenetics.com                 of your crop, as no one in their right mind would associ-
                                                      ate weed growing with a meaty smell. Towards the end
                     of flowering, however, your plants will take on a more vinegary, citric smell, and that’s
                     when you’ll have to be extra careful to ventilate and extract the odor properly.
                        Your harvest from X-18 Pure Pakistani won’t be huge, but you will walk away with
                     a decent stash of rock-hard, crusty, compact nugs that reek of quality. For each square
                     yard of grow room indoors, you will most likely take away about 400 to 500 grams of
                     dried, cured bud. These buds will be very easy to manicure as the calyx-to-leaf ratio
                     is so high, and they’ll be literally crusted with that beautiful resin; just be sure not to
                     touch your eyes before washing your hands.
                        The high point of growing this strain is when you finally get to roll your homegrown

                     your windpipe you’ll see why this is revered as such a fantastic strain. Then comes
                     the head rush and the spinning feeling, and your personality and situation will decide
                     what comes next: whether it’s the relaxing sleepiness or the brainstorming energy,
                     be sure to enjoy it to its full potential.

Zombie Rasta
 With a myriad of brilliantly-named cannabis strains out there you have to pull something
 very special out of the bag to make an impression on jaded tokers, and Spain’s Hero
 Seeds have definitely done that with Zombie Rasta. This name is a clever play on the
 name of one of its parent strains, Marley’s Collie, which was named after the legendary
 dead reggae star Bob Marley – ‘collie’ being slang for weed in his native Jamaica. This
 Jamaican and Afghani indica mix by was crossed with another indica, Black Domina,
 which is a blend of Afghani, Canadian Ortega, Northern Lights and Hash Plant.
    With such a rich gene pool, Zombie Rasta plants are something special. Owing to
 the strong influence of Marley’s Collie, these crops have wide, hefty leaves of the
 deepest green and a massive central cola if left untopped, which they prefer. Thanks
 to their good but not overly-extensive spread, they work well in a SOG set up as well
 as regular indoor soil grows. For the best harvest possible, be sure to give the right
 mix of nutrients and enough feeding. Zombie Rasta is more suited to indoor and
                               greenhouse grows, in which you can expect flowering in
  Hero Seeds, Spain            60 days and plant heights of up to 65 inches.

Zombie Virus
 OGA Seeds is a Canadian seed bank offering high quality, unique strains for growers
 around the world. For their fabulously-named Zombie Virus, they have crossed their
 two favorite strains from 2008: a beautiful pure indica mom and a Diesel cross dad.
 The stability of the mother plant and the grapey undertones of the father give a plant
 that is a joy to both grow and smoke, no matter what your toke tolerance.
    The ease of growing Zombie Virus makes it a good choice for growers of any level,
 and it also clones easily, too. With its mother’s durable form, this plant can handle a
 lot of nutrients and responds well to fertilizer, but if you’re working with an outdoor
 grow, you should ensure that it doesn’t get rained on too much due to its sticky nature.
 It responds well to topping, but continues a steady growth even without. Even in a 3
 gallon pot, Zombie Virus will give a substantial yield. Don’t leave it in the vegetative
 stage for too long, especially if growing indoors, as it will become unruly. If you have
 room for the 8 feet tall plants outside, then let them go mad.
                                  If its ability to grow almost on its own gives it the Virus
  OGA Seeds, Canada            tag, then the stone definitely gives rise to the Zombie
  Indica-Dominant              part of the name: stoners smoking this strain will be put
