## **1\. Introduction: The Need for a Comprehensive Cannabis Parameter List**

Cannabis sativa L. represents a plant of increasing significance across various domains, including medicine, agriculture, and legal frameworks. Its complex nature and the diverse applications stemming from its unique properties necessitate a thorough understanding of its myriad parameters and characteristics. The escalating interest in its therapeutic potential, coupled with the growing trend towards legalization in many parts of the world, underscores the urgent need for a consolidated and scientifically validated resource. Such a resource would serve as a bedrock of knowledge for researchers seeking to unravel its full potential, policymakers tasked with crafting informed regulations, industry stakeholders aiming to develop responsible practices, and the general public striving for accurate information.  
Currently, information pertaining to cannabis is widely scattered across a diverse range of sources. Scientific findings are published in numerous peer-reviewed articles, while legal statutes and regulations are documented in governmental archives. Industry-specific data often resides in proprietary reports, and anecdotal accounts can be found in various public forums. This fragmentation of information presents a significant challenge for anyone seeking a holistic understanding of the plant. Furthermore, inconsistencies in the terminology used to describe cannabis, its various components, and its effects can lead to confusion and impede effective communication across different disciplines. The nomenclature surrounding cannabis, particularly the distinction between formal botanical classifications and vernacular terms, has historically been applied inconsistently, contributing to the existing ambiguity. Given the dynamic nature of cannabis research and the rapidly evolving legal landscape, a static and dispersed body of knowledge is insufficient. A comprehensive, adaptable, and centralized resource is essential to navigate this complex and evolving field.
