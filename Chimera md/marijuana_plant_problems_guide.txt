INTRODUCTION




Whether you are a home grower with a couple of marijuana plants or a commercial grower with hundreds of plants, this book will help you diagnose problems and find solutions. Disorders (such as unhealthy growing conditions), pests, and diseases are all included here. You can treat all these problems by improving growing conditions, using biological controls, or applying safe, organic remedies.

We are botanists, plant pathologists, and writers. We’ve owned nurseries and traveled the world on botanical adventures. In this book, we have compiled the most recent research to help you grow healthy cannabis. The United States government considers cannabis an illegal crop, resulting in no U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines, no Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards, and virtually no university research on acceptable treatments for pests and diseases or on the efficacy of those treatments. Research on organic cultivation of cannabis is relatively limited. To find the best organic methods, we have worked with licensed legal growers who use organic practices and we have relied on research from European sources, the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI), and other scientific literature.

Every state in the United States that has legalized marijuana has its own statutes and guidelines. Be sure to find out what is permitted in your location, because we are not legal experts. Finally, we are not medical practitioners and have conducted no research on the medicinal attributes of marijuana. Please consult with your doctor or health care practitioner for advice on its medicinal uses.





WHY USE ORGANIC GROWING TECHNIQUES?


Whatever your intended use of cannabis—whether as a medicine, relaxant, mood enhancer, ritualistic practice aid, or vehicle to alter perception—you must inhale, ingest, or otherwise absorb its active ingredients. Any nonorganic, synthetic pesticide used on plants winds up inside you. Synthetic chemicals such as pesticides damage human health and the living community of which we are a part. Choose organic techniques to protect yourself and the environment.

No matter where cannabis is grown, virtually no health and safety standards exist for growing it. Because it is considered illegal in many places, research is lacking and testing is not standardized. Recent media coverage has revealed that pesticide residue on marijuana is an escalating problem. Labs that have performed tests have frequently found contaminants such as pesticides and heavy metals. These pesticides include fungicide and insecticide residues at levels sixteen-hundred times higher than the legal limit for food plants. This is alarming. It just makes sense to do everything possible to eliminate this threat to the health of cannabis growers, users, and the biosphere.





ABOUT CANNABIS


People have cultivated cannabis for medicinal, spiritual, and recreational purposes for ten thousand years. In 2008, an archeological dig of a shaman’s grave in China revealed the earliest record of its medicinal use some twenty-seven-hundred years ago, and evidence shows that ritual use is more than four thousand years old. Recreational and mood-altering uses are likely just as ancient. The Greek historian Herodotus, writing in 440 BCE, mentions its euphoric effects in his Histories. In more modern times, people have made paper, clothing, and rope from hemp fiber and oil and milk from the seeds.

Because of our relationship with this important plant, humans have carried cannabis around the globe for so long that it’s difficult to determine exactly where the plant originated or even how many species of Cannabis exist. One example of cannabis proliferation comes from nineteenth-century Europe, when ships carried the seeds around the world so that sailors could sow them in every port to ensure a ready supply of hemp rope for rigging. Such practices make it a challenge to determine the natural history of cannabis. In addition, its botanical classification and nomenclature are always changing.

Knowing something about the botanical classification and nomenclature of marijuana helps breeders and growers make informed decisions about what strains to grow and how best to nurture them. Marijuana growers use the term “strain” where other horticulturalists or agriculturalists would use the terms “species” or “cultivar” (cultivated variety). By knowing and recognizing a specific strain, you know something about the genetic background of the plant you want to grow. The genetic background determines many of the plants’ cultural needs (such as whether it prefers warm or cool temperatures, how big it will get, and its light requirements for flowering).

Although botanists have been arguing about this for more than two hundred years, two different kinds of cannabis plants are generally recognized and widely cultivated: sativa and indica. Authorities differ as to whether these two plants are, in fact, different species (Cannabis sativa and C. indica) or whether they are two different subspecies of a single species (C. sativa subsp. sativa and C. sativa subsp. indica). Some botanists have named C. afghanica as a separate species, while others declare that this plant is merely a variety, C. sativa var. afghanica. No matter which botanical name you prefer, afghanica is grown to produce hashish. To confuse the issue further, many growers incorrectly name C. afghanica as C. indica. An additional species, C. ruderalis, is not commonly cultivated but is occasionally included in breeding programs.





Although in formal horticultural nomenclature, plant species names are not usually isolated from the genus name (as in Cannabis sativa), to make things a bit easier, we will refer to the two primary species or types as “sativa” and “indica” throughout this book, without the genus name or italics.

To a botanist, the fact that these different types of cannabis are recognizably different, taste different, and have very different psychoactive properties does not mean that they are separate species. For example, it’s easy to see the differences between broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and kale. They look different, they taste different, and they have different culinary uses. But that does not mean they are separate species. In fact, all four of them are simply cultivars of one species, Brassica oleracea. The same might be said of cannabis. All of these different forms are fully interfertile—that is, they will readily interbreed with one another and their offspring are fertile.

Despite the botanical confusion, everyone generally agrees that the two primary kinds of marijuana plants, sativa and indica, differ in the compounds they contain and in the effects they produce. Recent research on the effects of these compounds reveals that the psychoactive constituents, tetrahydrocannabinols (THC), induce euphoria and alter mental states. The other components, cannabidiols (CBD), are not as psychoactive and have been shown to be valuable medicinal compounds.

Sativa plants, or sativa-dominant strains, generally grow very tall (8 to 15 feet/2.5 to 4.6 m) and have relatively skinny leaflets. Widespread in tropical lowland regions around the world, sativa was the principal marijuana product transported from Mexico into the United States for many years. Modern strains, known as pure sativa or mostly sativa, are high in THC and low in CBD. Sativa consumers report that consuming these strains creates a feeling of relaxation and euphoria.

Indica plants, or indica-dominant strains, are generally much shorter (less than 5 feet/1.5 m tall) and bushier than sativa and have wide leaflets. They are adapted to cooler climates and originated at high elevations in Central Asia. Many indica strains, known as pure indica or mostly indica, are low in THC and high in CBD. Even though consuming them does not contribute much to euphoria, they can produce a soporific effect, like a sedative. Thus, the low level of THC makes these strains more useful for medicine, because the consumer achieves the healing benefits without getting high.

Contemporary breeders are creating hybrids of sativa and indica, and they are constantly improving the quality and increasing the quantity of the active ingredients. Today, cannabis is used to treat chronic pain, muscle spasms, glaucoma in adults, and epilepsy and other seizures in children. It also reduces nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and improves the appetite of people with HIV/AIDS. Promising new research strongly indicates that cannabis is effective in the treatment of cancer as well. A study compiled in 2011 reported that medical patients in California used cannabis to treat pain, anxiety, muscle spasms, and headaches, and as a relaxant and sleep aid. Undoubtedly, further research will reveal more benefits from this remarkable plant.





The leaflets of indica types are wide. The leaflets of sativa types are narrow.





HOW TO USE THIS BOOK


Part I is organized into six chapters, according to the part of the plant on which you see symptoms:

• Chapter one, Problems on the Whole Plant

• Chapter two, Problems on Leaves

• Chapter three, Problems on Flowers and Flower Buds • Chapter four, Problems on Stems

• Chapter five, Problems on Roots

• Chapter six, Problems on Seeds and Seedlings



Each chapter in Part I is divided into categories of symptoms that affect that particular plant part. Here are some symptom examples:

• Leaves have tiny speckles or stipples.

• Leaves have ¼-inch (6 mm) or larger round spots or blotches.

• Leaves have angular spots.



The symptom category directs you to a visual problem-solving guide. Each guide includes four parts: a photograph of the symptom, a written description of the symptom, a diagnosis, and a list of solutions for that problem. The symptoms used for diagnosis are visible to the naked eye, but a hand lens or magnifying glass may be helpful in some cases (for seeing tiny pests such as mites).

The diagnoses appear in order from most common to least common problems you are likely to encounter. First come mites and insects, then diseases, and finally disorders.

Part II is organized into ten chapters:

• Chapter seven, Change the Growing Conditions

• Chapter eight, Use Biological Controls

• Chapter nine, Use Organic Chemical Remedies

• Chapter ten, Create Healthy Growing Conditions • Chapter eleven, Manage Nutrients

• Chapter twelve, Manage Light

• Chapter thirteen, Manage Water

• Chapter fourteen, Manage Temperature and Humidity • Chapter fifteen, Use Proper Pruning Techniques • Chapter sixteen, Use Proper Propagation Techniques



Chapter seven begins with prevention techniques and then moves on to control techniques. You can also consult this chapter if you bypassed the problem-solving guides and simply want to look up a specific prevention technique.

Chapter eight addresses all the biological controls listed in the solutions column in the problem-solving guides. We tackle each type of beneficial organism in its own section. The order in which they appear is insects, mites, fungi, nematodes, bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Each section begins with a chart: the first column of the chart provides the diagnosis, and the second column provides the name of the beneficial organism with a page reference. If you have decided to bypass the visual problem-solving guide, you can still look up how to use any beneficial organism that we include.

Chapter nine speaks to organic chemical remedies. It begins with a section on safety. We strongly recommend that you read this section and adopt these practices. You will then find all the remedies included in the problem-solving guides, listed from least toxic to most toxic. You can also use this chapter to learn how to take safety precautions, and you can use any of these remedies without consulting the problem-solving guides.

Chapters ten through sixteen give you tools and information for correcting problems you found in the problem-solving guides, along with best practices to grow healthy plants and prevent problems in the first place.





Each chapter in this part of the book presents a visual problem-solving guide, based on the whole plant or a plant organ (leaf, flower, stem, root, seed). The guides include photographs of symptoms, written descriptions of symptoms, diagnoses, and lists of organic solutions.

Follow this procedure to use the visual problem-solving guides:

1. Determine which plant part shows the symptom (for example, leaves).

2. Turn to the appropriate chapter in Part I (for example, chapter two, Problems on Leaves).

3. Decide which category fits the symptoms you observe (for example, “Leaves have holes,” this page).

4. Turn to the correct page for the visual problem-solving guide for that plant part and category.

5. Look through the photographs in the guide to find one that matches the symptoms you see on your plant.

6. Read the written symptom description carefully and make sure it matches what you see. Do not rely solely on the photograph.

7. Make certain that both the photograph and the symptom description match your observations. If they do not match, keep looking.

8. When you find a match, you will have your diagnosis.

9. Look at the last column for a list of solutions to that problem, with page references.

10. Choose recommended solutions that fit your circumstances, and turn to the page indicated.

• Use neem

• Use diatomaceous earth





Plant pathologists use what is known as the “disease triangle” as a primary tool to diagnose and treat plant diseases and pests. The three points of the triangle represent the three conditions that must coincide to bring about disease infections or pest infestations of your plants:

• The environment The environment must be favorable to the pest or pathogen. Make the environment inhospitable to the pest or pathogen to prevent it from successfully attacking your marijuana plants.

• Susceptibility Your plants must be susceptible to a pest or disease in order for that pathogen to be successful.

• Presence of pest or pathogen Because fungal spores are always present in the air and insect pests are ubiquitous, diseases and pests are almost always waiting in the wings for the opportunity to strike.



If you can change just one of these conditions, pests and diseases cannot get a foothold and cause damage.

The use of chemical pest and disease solutions became popular in the 1930s, when both agriculturalists and horticulturalists began to control pests and diseases with synthetic pesticides, designer poisons created to kill specific targets. It turns out, however, that this practice is the most costly solution for plant problems in many ways. Pests and diseases acquire resistance to pesticides (insecticides, miticides, fungicides, bactericides, and nematicides) as fast as we can invent new ones. Pesticides also damage workers’ and consumers’ health and harm the environment.

Modern control practices look for a sequence of preferred solutions that, first, change the growing conditions; second, use natural biological controls; and, finally, seek a chemical remedy. With this in mind, if you must resort to a chemical remedy, always choose an organic one. Never use a nonorganic remedy on your marijuana. This is as important for your marijuana as it is for your vegetables and fruit: organic remedies are less harmful to your health, to the health of people consuming the marijuana you grow, and to the environment.

LOCAL REGULATIONS

Before using any solution, commercial marijuana growers should check with a local regulatory agency to discover whether that solution is permitted. In the United States, every state and county where cannabis is legal has its own unique set of regulations. Even the regulatory agency you must deal with is different from place to place. Before you grow, get informed about regulations and requirements.





Look for solutions in this order:

1. Make the environment unfavorable to pests and diseases by changing the growing conditions.

2. Do not grow susceptible plants. Keep your plants healthy so that they do not become susceptible, and choose plants that are genetically resistant to pests and diseases.

3. If all else fails, manage the pest or disease by choosing the appropriate organic remedy.





CHAPTER SEVEN


CHANGE THE GROWING CONDITIONS




Poor growing conditions are the primary cause of problems on marijuana (and on other plants, for that matter). When diagnosing problems, plant pathologists apply the 80/20 rule: 80 percent of the time plant problems are caused by a poor growing environment, and 20 percent of the time pests or pathogens cause the problem. To distinguish the environmental problems, or disorders, from issues caused by pests and pathogens, they are sometimes specifically referred to as abiotic disorders.

Even when a problem is caused by the presence of a pest or disease, often poor growing conditions have stressed the plant and rendered it susceptible to attack. Improving the growing conditions relieves the stress and helps the marijuana plant gain strength to fight off the infection or infestation. Changing the growing conditions also renders the environment inhospitable to pests and diseases and helps prevent them from spreading.

First, put your marijuana plants in the most appropriate growing environment. Make sure they’re growing in healthy growing media, with the appropriate nutrients, with sufficient water and light, and within the best temperature range. If any one of these components is less than optimal, your plants may be stressed—and, as it does with humans, stress makes your plants susceptible to infection. Read more about creating the right environment to prevent problems in the first place in chapters ten through sixteen.





SANITIZE


Sanitizing is the single most important action you should take right away to help your plants recover, as well as to prevent problems in the first place. When you sanitize, you prevent pests and diseases from decimating the entire plant as well as from spreading to your other plants.

Keep your growing area and yourself clean and neat. Don’t leave plant debris lying around. Wash your hands frequently, and launder your clothing after working with your plants. Keep your shoes or boots clean. Wear clean clothing every time you enter your growing area. Aphids, spider mites, and mold spores hitchhike on your clothing, your skin, and in the soil on your shoes, and you carry them with you wherever you go. For indoor commercial growers, we recommend that you wear polyethylene suits as well as face masks, booties, and gloves in your grow rooms. Always don this clean protective gear before entering the room.

Sterilize your tools. Pruning shears, knives, scissors, or any tool used to cut sick plants carry pathogens that will infect the next healthy plant on which you use that tool. Unfortunately, infections can be symptomless, so sometimes you don’t know a plant is sick. Tools used on one plant should be sterilized before they are used on another.

Several sterilization methods work well:

• Use a blow torch to heat any metal tool used to cut plants. The heat sterilizes the blades quickly. You don’t have to get them red hot and cause the metal to lose its temper (its hardness and ability to hold an edge)—just heat the tool to the point at which it’s too hot to touch. Let the blades cool down before using them again. Use two pruners: While one is cooling, prune with the other. Alternate back and forth, heating and cooling. This system is commonly used by orchid growers to protect their plants from viral infections.

• Dip your tools in a 10-percent solution of household bleach (one part bleach to nine parts water). Be aware, however, that bleach can corrode metal.

• Boil your tools for twenty minutes, or heat them in a pressure cooker at 15 pounds of pressure for fifteen minutes.

• Use rubbing alcohol and soap and water to clean tools. This method is effective against pests such as insects and mites, but it is ineffective against viruses.



Sanitize your plants. Getting rid of infested or infected plant parts or even whole plants prevents the spread of pests and diseases. At the first signs of infection by a pathogen or pest, cut off any parts of the plant that are infected, and immediately remove the debris from your growing area. For example, the mold you can see is busy manufacturing millions of spores that float through the air and cause new infections on healthy tissues. Removing a moldy leaf reduces the inoculum load (the number of spores in the air) and cuts down on the potential incidence of disease. Similarly, the adult pest you see is busy laying eggs you probably don’t see, so removing infested leaves from your plants helps to control insect populations. Don’t be so enthusiastic about this that you defoliate your plant, however. Leaves are vital and provide food that plants need through photosynthesis. If the infection has gotten away from you and is rampant, select an appropriate organic remedy rather than pulling all the leaves off a plant.

Note that for viruses, root rot fungi, and root nematodes, you must pull up or remove the entire plant and discard it.





Remove leaves covered in powdery mildew to reduce the inoculum load of spores in the air and slow down the rate of new infections.

Sanitize at the end of each growing season. If your plants grow outdoors, sanitize plots after harvest by removing all of the plants, roots and all, and discarding them. Dig them up, bag them, and put them in the trash, or burn the residue if it is safe and legal to do so. Do not compost any diseased material; it can come back to haunt you. Indoor growers can sanitize the indoor growing area by washing down the rooms and all tools and equipment with warm, soapy water.

Before you start a new crop, be certain that residue (stems, roots, and dead leaves) from the last crop is disposed of properly. Many pests and pathogens survive in this plant material and will infect your new, healthy plants at the first opportunity. In addition, do not put new, healthy marijuana plants into potting media that supported a previous crop of cannabis. You can use this media for other plants, such as flowers and herbs, but never reuse it for marijuana.





WEED


Weeds are invasive plants that grow where you do not want them. Weeds provide hiding places for pests such as slugs and snails, serve as a habitat for numerous pestiferous insects and mites, and can carry diseases caused by bacteria, phytoplasmas, and viruses. For example, leafhoppers and aphids that feed on weeds can easily invade your marijuana crop. Both of these types of insects are vectors (carriers) for viruses and phytoplasmas. Weeds also compete with your cannabis crop for water, nutrients, and light. Eliminate all weeds, including dodder and broomrape, from your outdoor patch or inside your greenhouse. Eradicate weeds that grow nearby as well, because they can also be a source for airborne or waterborne pests and pathogens that migrate into your space. For a list of plants that attract beneficial organisms and are not considered weeds in this context, see “Plant Polycultures,” this page. There are three methods for eliminating weeds:

Use sheet mulch. This is an effective way to get rid of weeds in an outdoor growing area. Cut down or mow all the weeds to the ground, leaving the severed weeds in place. Cover the area with flattened and overlapping sheets of cardboard, making sure that no light gets through any cracks in the cardboard layer. Without access to light, pests, pathogens, and weeds will die and will no longer pose a threat to your cannabis. Place a 3-inch (7.5 cm) layer of organic mulch on top of the cardboard—do not use nutrient-rich compost, which can reintroduce weeds. Within a year, the cardboard-covered and mulched weeds will be dead, the cardboard will have decomposed, and you’ll have a new growing bed.

Hoe or pull weeds. Hand weeding is effective when you have to remove weeds around plants that you don’t want to disturb. Try to get rid of any annual weeds before they set seed. Some weeds, however, are perennials that grow from underground rhizomes, and each tiny piece you leave in the ground grows into a new weed. So keep at this task.





Lay down cardboard to sheet mulch a berm to control weeds.





Cover the surface of growing media with organic mulch such as bark, which will decompose over time and feed the living soil community.

Use a germination inhibitor. Inhibitors, such as corn gluten, prevent seeds from germinating. These inhibitors affect only seeds, not established plants, and will have no effect on the underground rhizomes of perennial weeds. The inhibitors will also keep marijuana seeds or vegetable seeds from germinating just as effectively as they do with weed seeds. Use inhibitors only on bare ground after you’ve hoed and pulled the existing weeds. Non-GMO corn gluten is available from organic garden centers and Internet suppliers.





MULCH


Mulching involves covering soil with a layer of material in an outdoor plot. In topdressing containers, you place the mulch on top of potting media. Mulching is a valuable practice because it conserves moisture, helps to prevent weed seeds from germinating, and controls some pests and diseases.

The best mulch for outdoor cannabis culture is made from clean, nutrient-poor organic material such as sustainably harvested shredded tree bark, coconut husks, nut shells, pine needles, straw, or shredded newspaper or cardboard. These materials decompose over time, release nutrients slowly, and fertilize your soil as they decompose. You’ll need to replenish the mulch periodically.

Never use compost as mulch. Compost is rich in nutrients and makes a perfect germination medium for weed seeds.

All of the organic mulching materials we’ve mentioned can also be used as topdressing in containers. However, growers who have a few plants in their homes may prefer more attractive, nonorganic mulch such as gravel, sand, or decorative stone. None of these materials decompose, but they perform all the other functions of good mulch.





USE ROW COVERS


Outdoors, while your marijuana plants are still small and vulnerable, protect them with a lightweight, white, spun-fiber, polyester row-cover fabric specifically made for this purpose. Row covers are exclusionary devices that let in sunlight, air, and water, but keep insect pests out. Not only do they protect your plants from insect pests, but they also prevent insect vectors from infecting your plants with viruses, bacteria, or phytoplasmas. Keep in mind, however, that when a row cover is in place, it also prevents beneficial organisms such as lady beetles, parasitic wasps, and pirate bugs from reaching your plants.

You can make a framework of PVC tubing, wood, metal, or another material to support the fabric and keep it off your plants. Alternatively, hoop houses are available at nursery supply stores. Cover the frame with fabric and weigh or pin down the edges along the ground to seal out insects. (Make sure no pests are lurking inside the cover before you seal it up!) When your plants grow taller and more resilient, remove the row covers so that beneficial organisms can visit your plants.





Hoops made with flexible PVC (polyvinyl chloride) tubing provide a good framework for breathable row-cover fabric that protects young plants from insect pests. Remove the cover as plants grow taller and stronger.

You can also cover individual plants in containers. Create a small frame that fits over each plant and its pot, and attach an insect-proof cover to the frame. Plant supports designed for flowers or tomatoes work well and are commercially available. Cover the plants with row-cover fabric, pieces of polyester window screening, or mosquito netting—any material weave that’s tight enough to keep insects out but open enough to let in sunlight, air, and water.





USE SCREENS ON DOORS, VENTS, AND WINDOWS


Install insect-proof screens on all doors, vents, and windows of your indoor growing space. This exclusionary measure is similar to adding row covers, but it covers the entire area of a grow room or greenhouse. Any opening to the outside that is not screened enables pests and diseases to fly or float into your growing space and wreak havoc on your plants. Do not create an airless seal, however, because your plants require a good flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide to grow.





USE CUTWORM COLLARS


A cutworm collar is a simple cylinder inserted around the base of an outdoor plant. It can be made of cardboard, such as the tube inside a roll of toilet paper or paper towels; metal, such as a strip of tin can; or paper, such as a strip cut from a paper cup. Cut a strip 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10.0 cm) long, slit it up one side, and wrap it around the base of the marijuana plant. These plant collars are very effective against cutworm and armyworm damage, especially for young seedlings, because cutworms in the soil won’t cross these physical barriers to reach the tender plants.





Make a handy DIY cutworm collar using a toilet paper tube. This barrier protects your plants from cutworms and armyworms that hide in the soil.





Simple barriers made from a durable material such as tarpaper prevent adult root maggot flies from laying their eggs on your plant stems.





USE TARPAPER COLLARS


A tarpaper collar is a flat piece of tarpaper, roofing shingle, plastic, or similar flexible and durable material about 5 inches (12.5 cm) square (or in diameter if round). Punch a hole in the middle that is the same size as your plant’s stem. This will allow the collar to fit snugly around the plant’s stem. Cut a straight slit from the side directly to the hole in the middle. Spread the slit open and slide the collar into position so that it lays on the ground, completely covering the soil that surrounds the base of your plant. This is very effective against root maggots, which are the larvae of certain flies. The adult female fly wants to lay her eggs right at the base of the stem at the soil line. Her eggs hatch into maggots that eat all the roots of your plants. With the tarpaper collar in place, she cannot lay her eggs because the base of the stem is hidden under the collar. No eggs, no maggots.





USE COPPER TAPE


Copper tape makes a fairly effective barrier against slugs and snails, because the mollusks do not like to slime their way across copper. Garden centers carry copper tape made expressly for the purpose of repelling slugs and snails. First, find and eliminate (hand-pick) all the slugs and snails from your plots and pots. Fasten the copper tape to the frame of raised beds, the sides of your pots, or along a border around your outdoor plot.





USE FENCES


Fences are used primarily to keep deer, rabbits, and other mammalian herbivores out of your cannabis patch. Fences can be effective against deer if they are at least 8 feet (2.5 m) tall. A 6-foot-tall (2 m) fence with a 2-foot (0.6 m) extension on the top can also keep them out. A deer fence must also be sturdy. A good fence is probably the most expensive deer deterrent, but it is also the most effective one.





A sturdy, 6-foot-tall (2 m) fence with a 2-foot (0.6 m) extension at the top makes an effective barricade against large mammals such as deer.

Chicken wire fences can keep rabbits and other small mammals out of your plot. A rabbit fence should be about 2 feet (0.6 m) tall. Fasten the chicken wire to wooden or metal posts, and pin the wire to the ground with long metal staples. If rabbits or other critters start digging their way under the fence, dig a 1-foot-deep (0.3 m) trench directly beneath the fence, place chicken wire in the trench, and then backfill.





USE NETTING


Flexible plastic netting can also be used to deter deer and rabbits from accessing and eating your marijuana. Because deer will push against the mesh to reach the plants, attach it to a sturdy frame. Nursery supply centers carry deer netting made expressly for keeping deer out of gardens. This is the least expensive deer fence, and possibly the least effective one. Hungry deer will often nose under any loosely attached netting to access the greenery.





PUT A LAYER OF SAND OR PERLITE OVER THE POTTING MEDIA


A 1-inch-thick (2.5 cm) layer of inorganic material such as sand or perlite on top of your potting media helps to exclude fungus gnat larvae from potted plants both indoors and outdoors. Fungus gnats are tiny black flying insects that lay their eggs in the soil. After hatching, gnat larvae eat fungi, organic matter, and the roots of your marijuana plants. They’re especially common in moist, organic potting media. When you add a layer of inorganic sand or perlite on top of the potting media, adult fungus gnats are unable to reach the soil to lay eggs in your containers. (Use caution when handling perlite, however, because breathing in perlite dust can damage your lungs.)





TURN OFF LIGHTS AT NIGHT


In the spring and summer, indoor and outdoor lighting attracts moths at night, which batter against window screens and loop crazily around lightbulbs. These moths lay eggs that hatch into caterpillars that love to eat your marijuana plants. Turn off unnecessary outdoor lighting and block indoor lights that shine through windows to avoid luring these pests into your growing area.





FILTER THE AIR


Molds such as powdery mildew, gray mold, and many other pathogenic fungi produce microscopic airborne spores by the billions. Indoors, the density of spores in the air (the inoculum load) can be quite high, especially if you’ve had problems with mold in the past. Use a good-quality HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) purifier/filter to clear these spores from the air. Excellent machines that are designed to clean the air for people with allergies and asthma are not terribly expensive and work extremely well.





MOVE THE AIR


Install fans inside your grow room or greenhouse to improve the airflow. Stagnant air enables mold spores and flying insects to settle on your plants and damage them. Moving the air helps keep these critters at bay. You don’t need a strong wind; a gentle breeze will do—just enough to rustle the leaves. Airflow also helps the plants breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen, which is necessary for photosynthesis to take place. Plants do not grow or even survive without this gas exchange.





Keep the air moving to help control pests and diseases, and to keep your plants “breathing” well.





REMOVE PESTS BY HAND


Some insect pests, such as slugs and snails, caterpillars, earwigs, beetles, and weevils, are large enough to remove by hand. Use your bare or gloved hands, or try a tool such as kitchen tongs to pick them up if you’re too squeamish to handle them. Crush pests with your fingers or dump them into a jar of soapy water and they’ll die instantly. You can also hold a jar of soapy water under a pest on a leaf and knock the creature into the jar.

Pluck slugs and snails off plants and drop them in salt water or beer (though it’s a shame to use perfectly good beer for this purpose). When you’re weeding or cultivating your crop, if you notice cutworms in the soil, dig them out and destroy them.





USE TRAPS


You can use several commercially available traps to catch a variety of plant pests.

Use sticky bands. These are made of flexible material coated with sticky goo that you wrap around the base of a plant near the soil line. The gooey substance traps insects such as ants, earwigs, and weevils that try to walk across it. Sticky bands are particularly helpful for preventing ants from bringing aphids to your plants. The bands and sticky goo are available at nursery supply stores.

Use sticky cards and traps. Sticky cards are colored sheets of rigid plastic or plywood that are coated with a sticky substance. Mount the yellow, pink, or blue squares on stakes, hang them from lines, or place them on the soil. Pests are attracted to the color, land on the sticky substance, become trapped, and die. Yellow traps are effective in controlling aphids, fungus gnats, leaf miners, whiteflies, and the adult flies of root maggots. Blue or pink sticky traps help control thrips.

Use earwig traps. You can capitalize on the earwig habit of hiding during the day in dark, moist places. Give them a place to hide by creating a simple trap made of damp, loosely rolled newspaper secured with a rubber band. Place these around the growing area in the evening, pick up the papers in the morning, and crush the little invaders.

Use slug and snail traps. Like earwigs, slugs and snails like to hide in dark, moist places, especially on sunny days. Create hiding places by turning flower pots upside down or lying flat boards on the ground. Use pebbles to prop up the pots or boards slightly. Check the traps during the afternoon, pick out the pests, and drop them in a jar of saltwater or beer.

Use live traps. Some small mammals such as field voles, gophers, mice, rabbits, rats, squirrels, and woodchucks can be caught in live traps. After the animal is trapped, you can release it somewhere away from your growing area in the countryside. These traps are available at many hardware stores, and some animal control departments and humane societies will loan or rent them for a fee. (Note that we do not recommend using poison for any of these animals. Poison enters the food chain and it can kill birds, snakes, and other mammals, including pets.)





VACUUM ADULT INSECTS FROM THE AIR


Use a vacuum cleaner inside a grow room or greenhouse to suck up flying insects. This technique works well against adult whiteflies and fungus gnats, but be aware that it reduces only the flying adult population; larvae will not be affected. The larvae of whiteflies are so small they’re invisible to the naked eye, and the larvae of fungus gnats live in the soil where you can’t see them. These larvae will mature into adults and will soon be flying around. Suck them up before they mate and lay eggs to diminish the pest population gradually.





CHAPTER EIGHT


USE BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS




Biological pest and disease control involves using valuable natural predators, parasites, and pathogens to manage and destroy destructive organisms on your plants. If you grow outdoors, you can encourage beneficial partners from nature to visit your plants by crafting conditions they find attractive in the wild. Consider creating a polyculture of plants known to attract beneficial organisms near your cannabis fields. These beneficial partners do an amazing job of combating pests and diseases on all plants in the ecosystem, including your cannabis. Take a look at “Plant Polycultures,” this page, for a more detailed discussion.

If you’re growing cannabis indoors, you can purchase beneficial organisms from specialty producers. Look for reputable companies that use sustainable practices to produce noninvasive organisms. We have listed resources in the back of the book; before you use anything, however, always verify which beneficial controls are considered noninvasive in your area. The following tables of organisms provide beneficial organisms in order from easiest to obtain to more difficult to obtain. In the lists following the tables, we include the scientific name for each organism so that you can be sure to find the best biological control to do the job.

AN IMPORTANT CAVEAT FOR USING BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS

Regulations vary from place to place regarding which biological controls you can use on cannabis, as well as what kinds and level of residues are allowed. In the United States, every state has its own idiosyncratic regulatory system. Check with the local regulatory body (wherever and whatever that may be—nation, state, province, county, municipality, and so on) to determine what is and is not permitted.

NOTE: Beneficial insects to use are listed in order from easiest to obtain to more difficult to obtain.

All of the beneficial insects listed here are available commercially from various reliable suppliers. Make sure your supplier actually raises these insects and does not collect them from wild populations. Each insect will arrive from the supplier with complete instructions on how to care for and use them. Pay attention to these instructions. These insects should be alive when you receive them and it’s all too easy to kill them accidentally by failing to provide the care they need.

Some of these beneficial insects undergo complete metamorphosis—that is, they go through four stages in their life cycle: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Eggs hatch into larvae, larvae become pupae, and winged adults emerge from pupae. Other beneficial insects have incomplete metamorphosis, with only three stages in their life cycle: egg, nymph, and adult. In this case, the nymphs look like miniature adults without wings. They do not pupate but instead become winged adults at their last molt (when they shed their outer skin).

Suppliers provide beneficial insects in one or more of these life stages. Read the supplier’s descriptions carefully so you can be prepared to handle eggs, larvae or nymphs, pupae, or adults properly.





Green lacewings | Chrysoperla carnea


• Use for aphids, leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms, mealybugs, mites, scale, and whiteflies



The adult green lacewing is less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. It’s pretty, with a bright green body, golden eyes, and transparent greenish wings with a lacelike network of veins.

The adult green lacewing eats pollen and nectar, not insects. Lacewing larvae, however, are voracious predators known as aphid lions.





The lacewing adult feeds on pollen and nectar. Her babies, known as aphid lions, are voracious predators of soft-bodied insects such as aphids.

Mature lacewing larvae are about ⅓ inch (8 mm) long and look like tiny brown alligators with huge pincers on their mouths. They move fast. It’s likely you won’t see them, but you should notice a decrease in harmful, soft-bodied pests on your plants. Each one eats up to one thousand aphids a day. They also eat many other insects, such as the larvae of whiteflies and the eggs of destructive moths. Mature larvae spin tiny cocoons in which they pupate. Green lacewings arrive as tiny eggs mixed with bran, as adults ready to lay eggs, or as larvae. Use a spray of water to wash active aphid and other pest populations off your plants, and then apply the lacewings following the supplier’s instructions. If you ordered larvae, release them individually on separate plants. They are little cannibals. Use green lacewings either indoors or outdoors.





Spider mite destroyers | Stethorus punctillum


• Use for mites (and their eggs) and whiteflies



This tiny, black lady beetle is only 1.5 mm long. Its long-legged larvae are gray and crawl about rather slowly from leaf to leaf. Pupae attach themselves to the undersides of leaves.

Spider mite destroyers specialize in devouring spider mites, other pest mites, and whiteflies. They do not eat beneficial mites.





An adult spider mite destroyer searches for and devours spider mites.

The adults are good fliers that seek out and destroy colonies of pest mites and whiteflies. The adults and larvae feed on all stages of mites—eggs, nymphs, and adults. Larvae crawl from leaf to leaf and plant to plant if leaves are touching, eating mites as they go.

Spider mite destroyers arrive as adults in bottles. They can be stored at 55°F to 65°F (13°C to 18°C) for up to twelve hours. Mist your plants before releasing these beneficials, and let them go in the evening, because they won’t fly in the dark. Open the bottle and shake them out evenly onto the foliage of infested plants. Be sure to concentrate them near the heaviest infestations. Your goal is for the adults to mate and lay eggs. Adults and larvae are excellent predators but larvae will stick around after the adults fly away. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Midge maggots | Feltiella acarisuga


• Use for mites



The midge maggot adult resembles a tiny, 2-mm-long, pinkish brown mosquito. Its larvae look like pale yellow-brown tiny slugs and are about 2 mm long at maturity. If you can see them, you’ll find pupae inside small white cocoons attached to the undersides of leaves.

After mating, the adult female flies to mite colonies to lay her eggs. On hatching, the predatory midge maggot larvae start eating mite eggs. As the larvae grow, they eat all stages of mites. Each larva eats about fifty mites before pupating. They do not eat beneficial mites.

Midge maggots arrive as pupae attached to leaves or paper inside a container. Set the container down among your plants and protect it from direct sunlight. Follow the supplier’s instructions for opening the container. The ideal temperature is from 60°F to 77°F (16°C to 25°C) with humidity at 50 to 90 percent. Adult insects hatch from the pupae over a two-week period. Each adult lives for three or four days, just long enough to mate and lay eggs. Eggs hatch in three days. Larvae feed on mites for four to six days. Once grown to mature size, the larvae spin cocoons and pupate. The entire process starts again when the new generation of pupae hatches. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Mirid bugs | Macrolophus caliginosus and Deraeocoris brevis


• Use Macrolophus caliginosus for aphids, mites, thrips, and whiteflies

• Use Deraeocoris brevis for leafhoppers and true bugs



Macrolophus caliginosus is a ¼-inch-long (6 mm), light green or black true bug native to the Mediterranean. It is raised and sold commercially in Europe, but prohibited in North America.

Deraeocoris brevis is a tiny true bug that’s about 3⁄16 inch (5 mm) long, shiny, and dark brown. It is native to North America and is abundant in the Pacific Northwest. Attract D. brevis to the cannabis patch with polyculture plantings (see this page). It is raised and sold commercially in the United States and Europe.

Where they are commercially available, both species of mirid bugs are supplied as nymphs and adults in containers. Shake them carefully onto infested leaves. They prefer a temperature range of 64°F to 86°F (18°C to 30°C), and humidity from 30 to 70 percent. Use them outdoors.





Minute pirate bugs | Orius insidiosus


• Use for aphids, cutworms and armyworms, leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms, mites, scale, thrips, and whiteflies



The adult minute pirate bug is a shiny black true bug with white patches on its wings. It’s about ⅛ inch (3 mm) long. The nymphs change color from yellow, to orange, to brown as they grow. Both the adults and nymphs are effective predators of many pest insects.

Like all true bugs, minute pirate bug adults and nymphs have mouthparts that work similarly to hypodermic needles. They stab their prey and suck out the body contents. Both adults and nymphs move quickly and are efficient at finding prey. Adults are strong, fast fliers.





Invite the minute pirate bugs to stick around by releasing them where they have plenty of pests to eat.

This bug prefers a temperature range of 64°F to 82°F (18°C to 28°C), with 60 percent humidity. They arrive as adults and nymphs in bottles. Release them in the early morning or late afternoon. Gently roll the container to mix the contents and shake out the predators close to pest infestations. Adults may fly away, so your goal is to invite them to mate and lay eggs. Once pirate bugs have eliminated all the pests, they may eat other beneficial insects and each other. They eat pollen from flowers in addition to eating insects. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Two-spotted lady beetles (aka ladybug or lady bird beetle) | Adalia bipunctata


• Use for aphids, leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms, mealybugs, and scale



The typical form of the adult two-spotted lady beetle looks like a little red Volkswagen Beetle with two black spots. The long, thin nymphs look like tiny, black alligators mottled in orange. Pupae are black with orange markings, and they attach to the undersides of leaves.

Lady beetles love to eat aphids. Adult lady beetles and their nymphs are excellent predators of aphids, but they will eat many other kinds of soft-bodied pest insects as well.

Lady beetles are sold as adult insects. They arrive in plastic tubs, bags, or bottles. The best temperature range is 61°F to 82°F (16°C to 28°C). Soon after they arrive, let them go in the evening just as it’s getting dark. Sprinkle the release area with water so they can get a drink. They’ll find a place to hide for the night. When they awake, they will dine eagerly on your pests. They will be outdone only by their insatiable babies. The two-spotted lady beetle is native to North America and Europe. It is the only species of lady beetle raised in insectaries. Use it indoors or outdoors.





An adult lady beetle snacks on aphids for lunch. These little beetles are excellent predators of aphids, mealybugs, scale, and other soft-bodied insects.





You don’t need to get carried away providing the perfect conditions for mating, but you really want lady beetles to mate and lay eggs. Their nymphs eat many times their weight in pests.





A lady beetle nymph looks nothing like the adult, so get to know them so that you can protect these little guys from harm.





If you come across this creature stuck to the underside of a leaf, don’t scrape it off; it’s a lady beetle pupa getting ready to hatch and eat all your aphids.

Note: The common “ladybug” sold in garden centers is the convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens. It is native to North America. It is harvested from the wild, not reared in insectaries, so we do not recommend its use. Outdoors, plant polycultures to attract these to your plants.





Lindorus lophanthae (formerly Rhyzobius lophanthae)


• Use for mealybugs and scale



The adult is a tiny, black lady beetle, about 2.5 mm long, with a brown head and thorax. The larvae look a bit like tiny gray alligators with pale stripes.

Adults and larvae both consume many species of scale insects and mealybugs. They also eat the eggs of other kinds of pest insects.

They are sold as adults in plastic tubs, bags, or bottles. This little predator thrives in a temperature range of 59°F to 77°F (15°C to 25°C), within a humidity range of 20 to 90 percent. Soon after they arrive, let them go in the evening just before dark, so they will take cover and not fly away. When they awaken, the adults will breakfast eagerly on your pests. They will be outdone only by their voracious babies. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Midges | Aphidoletes aphidimyza


• Use for aphids



The adult midge, a tiny fly that resembles a brown mosquito or fungus gnat, and its bright orange larvae (maggots), are both ⅛ inch (3 mm) long. The pupae are black.

The adult insect is not a predator. It eats honeydew and hides under leaves during the day. It is active at night. The larvae, however, eat sixty different species of aphids. They paralyze their prey by injecting them with poison, and then suck out all the body contents. Each maggot will eat up to one hundred aphids per week. When mature, the maggots drop to the ground and burrow into the soil or growing media to pupate.

They arrive as pupae in shaker bottles or tubs. The best temperature range is 70°F to 77°F (21°C to 25°C) with high humidity (70 percent or higher). Humidity is especially important for the pupae, because if they dry out they will die. Sprinkle the pupae in shady, humid locations, avoiding direct sun. The adult flies hatch from the pupae, mate, and lay eggs in the middle of aphid colonies. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Aphidius wasps | Aphidius colemani, A. matricariae


• Use for aphids



These tiny, black adult wasps are only ⅛ inch (3 mm) long. They eat honeydew, but their larvae feed on aphids. Both species are native to North America.

Aphidius wasps are parasitoids, and this means they spend part of their life cycle as parasites. Like all parasitoid wasps, they lay their eggs inside living prey. Aphidius parasitizes aphids. The female wasp inserts an egg into an aphid and the wasp larva eats the aphid from the inside out.

These wasps arrive in shaker bottles as adults or as pupae inside mummified aphids. A temperature range of 65°F to 85°F (18°C to 29°C) is best, and humidity should be higher than 50 percent. Shake them out onto the foliage of marijuana plants infested with aphids. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Aphelinus abdominalis


• Use for aphids



This very tiny wasp is about 2 to 3 mm long, with a black thorax and yellow abdomen. It is native to North America.

The female wasp lays one egg inside an aphid. The wasp larva eats the aphid from the inside out. When mature, the larva pupates inside the mummified husk of its aphid host.

The wasps arrive as aphid mummies containing wasp pupae in shaker bottles. Release them near marijuana plants infested with aphids. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Aphytis melinus


• Use for scale



These tiny, yellow-brown wasps are about 1 mm long. They are an effective parasitoid of numerous species of scale insects.

The female wasp lays an egg in a female scale when the scale is ready to mate. The wasp larva kills the female scale, pupates inside the husk, and the new adult wasp emerges in two or three weeks.

Adult wasps arrive in bottles and need to be released as soon as you receive them. The best temperature range is 76°F to 85°F (24°C to 29°C), at 40 to 50 percent humidity. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Diglyphus isaea


• Use for leaf miners



These tiny, iridescent, greenish black wasps with clear wings are about 2 mm long.

The adult female wasp finds leaf miner larvae inside their tunnels and kills them by stinging them. She lays eggs beside the corpses. The wasp larvae eat the dead leaf miner larvae, and the wasp larvae pupate inside the leaf miner tunnel.

Adult wasps are supplied in bottles. They are most effective in a temperature range of 75°F to 90°F (24°C to 32°C) and at 80 percent humidity. If you cannot release them immediately, you can store them in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Release them in the morning or evening. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Trichogramma wasps | Trichogramma brassicae, T. minutum, T. platneri, T. pretiosum


• Use for boring caterpillars, cutworms and armyworms, and leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms





This tiny trichogramma wasp lays its egg inside a moth egg that would otherwise hatch into a voracious budworm.

Adult trichogramma wasps are extremely small (up to 1 mm long) black wasps with yellow abdomens. The four species listed are reared commercially and widely available for effective caterpillar control.

These tiny wasps are moth-egg parasites. The female wasp lays an egg inside the moth egg. The wasp larva feeds on the moth egg, killing the developing caterpillar before it hatches. The wasp larva pupates inside the shell of the egg.

These wasps are supplied as pupae inside moth eggs glued to a support such as cardboard, paper, or bamboo. Hang cards where you see moths or where you find their eggs. For best success, use them in a temperature range of 68°F to 81°F (20°C to 27°C), with humidity at 60 percent. Keep them shaded and out of direct sunlight. Put the pupae out when the pest moths are actively laying eggs. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Anagyrus pseudococci


• Use for mealybugs



This tiny, brown wasp with clear wings is about 2 mm long.





This extremely small wasp, Encarsia formosa, is both a parasite and predator of whiteflies.

The female wasp lays an egg inside a mealybug larva. The wasp larva hatches, kills and eats the mealybug larva, and then pupates inside the remains of its host. The mealybug larva becomes mummified and turns yellowish brown.

The adult wasps arrive in shaker bottles and can be stored in the refrigerator for a day or two. The optimum temperature range is 51°F to 96°F (11°C to 36°C), with 50 percent humidity. Outdoors, release them in the early morning. Indoors, release them in the evening or just before the lights go off.





Encarsia formosa


• Use for whiteflies



This very tiny wasp is both a parasitoid and a predator of whiteflies. The adult is about 0.6 mm long, with a black head and thorax and a yellow abdomen.

The female wasp lays its eggs inside whitefly larvae, which become mummified and turn brown or black, while the wasp matures inside the husk of its host. Adult wasps crawl out of the carcasses in about two weeks and will eat whitefly larvae in addition to laying eggs inside them.

They arrive from suppliers as pupae inside the mummies of whitefly larvae attached to cards. You can store them in the refrigerator for up to four days if necessary. Hang the cards in a shaded location near the bottom of your marijuana plants. The optimum temperature range is 64°F to 84°F (18°C to 29°C) and at 50 to 70 percent humidity. Adult wasps will emerge from the mummies in a week or two. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Eretmocerus eremicus


• Use for whiteflies



This very tiny parasitoid wasp (less than 1 mm long) is lemon yellow to yellow-brown. The adult wasp feeds on honeydew. It also eats and parasitizes whitefly larvae. It is native to the U.S. Southwest.

The female wasp lays an egg under a whitefly larva rather than inside it. When the wasp egg hatches, the baby wasp eats its way inside the whitefly larva and dines on its flesh. Then it goes dormant until the whitefly larva pupates. While the whitefly is pupating, the wasp larva liquefies the whitefly’s body with digestive enzymes and consumes it. The whitefly pupa turns tan and mummifies, and the baby wasp pupates inside the hollow corpse of its host. In about three weeks, the next generation of adult wasp emerges.

The wasps arrive as pupae inside whitefly mummies attached to cards or in bottles mixed with sawdust. Store them for two or three days in a refrigerator if you need to; otherwise, hang the cards on infested marijuana plants or sprinkle the pupae in shaded locations. Do not touch the pupae with your fingers, and keep them dry. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Delphastus catalinae


• Use for aphids, mites, and whiteflies



This adult lady beetle is shiny, black, and only 2 mm long. Its long-legged larvae look like little creamy yellow alligators. Adults and larvae are both predators of pest insects, especially whiteflies.

These little beetles are specialized predators with a gargantuan appetite for whitefly eggs and larvae. They are also content to dine on aphids and spider mites.

Adult insects arrive in bottles. The optimum temperature range is 61°F to 90°F (16°C to 32°C), with 75 percent humidity. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Mealybug destroyers | Cryptolaemus montrouzieri


• Use for mealybugs and scale



The mealybug destroyer is another small lady beetle about ⅙ inch (4 mm) long, shiny brownish black with a reddish orange head and midsection. Mealybug destroyer larvae are up to ½ inch (13 mm) long and are covered with woolly white wax (they look a lot like mealybugs). Both adults and larvae are voracious predators of mealybugs and scale insects.

They arrive as adult beetles in bottles or trays. Release them right away—they will be hungry. The optimum temperature range is 61°F to 91°F (16°C to 33°C), with 70 to 80 percent humidity. Outdoors, release them in the evening so they don’t fly away. Indoors, release them at lights out. Use them indoors or outdoors.





This tiny, black Delphastus catalinae lady beetle devours whitefly eggs and larvae.





Rove beetles | Dalotia coriaria


• Use for fungus gnats (larvae), root maggots, and thrips (pupae)



Adult beetles are brownish black and about ⅛ inch (3 mm) long. Their thin larvae are pale yellow and live in plant growing media. Adults are strong fliers.

Rove beetles feed on growing media–dwelling insects, including thrips pupating in growing media. Like the adults, rove beetle larvae are voracious and efficient predators.

These beetles are shipped as adult insects. Optimum temperature range is 55°F to 80°F (13°C to 27°C), with humidity from 50 to 80 percent. Use them indoors or outdoors.

NOTE: Beneficial mites to use are listed in order from easiest to obtain to more difficult to obtain.

Mites are tiny arachnids, in the same class (Arachnida) as spiders and ticks. Most have eight legs and none have wings. They are barely visible to the naked eye.

Beneficial mites are predators that hunt down, kill, and eat pest mites and some insects that feed on your plants. Some will feed on pollen or mold when prey populations are low.

Purchase beneficial mites from a reliable commercial supplier that raises them in captivity. Before you buy, be sure to read the information provided by the supplier. Choose the correct species that addresses your particular pest problem. Make sure you have the right conditions for that beneficial mite. All species arrive as adults packed in a media (such as bean leaves, corn grit, or vermiculite), inside a bottle or sachet. They are alive, hungry, and thirsty. Shake them out of the bottle on the day you receive them. Put them on marijuana foliage where they are likely to find pests to eat. Hang sachets near or on your plants.





Amblyseius andersoni

NOTE: Beneficial fungi to use are listed in order from easiest to obtain to more difficult to obtain.

Many species of beneficial fungi are entomopathogenic (that is, they infect and kill pest insects) making them excellent biopesticides and valuable partners for growers. Other species of beneficial fungi are mycoparasites that attack and kill fungal pathogens that cause disease on your plants. A third valuable feature of some beneficial fungi is that they can symbiotically colonize the root systems of your plants, live as mycorrhizal associates, and protect your plants from fungal pathogens.

All fungi, both beneficial and pathogenic, have a body made of filaments, or hyphae. The living body of the fungus looks like a spiderweb, but it grows through the growing media, leaf, or insect. All fungi reproduce by spores, which are produced both sexually (requiring genetic materials from two individuals) and asexually (a single organism produces an exact copy of itself). When a spore germinates, it produces a hypha, which penetrates the food source. Fungi secrete enzymes that digest their food outside their bodies, and then the fungi absorb the nutrients.





Hirsutella thompsonii


• Use for leafhoppers, mites, and spittlebugs



Hirsutella thompsonii is a fungal pathogen that infects and kills mites and certain insects such as leafhoppers and spittlebugs.

Spores of this fungus germinate quickly upon contact with mites or insect pests. The fungus penetrates the pest and kills it in a week or so. The fungus grows out of the dead pest and produces millions of new spores to continue to infect the pest population.

This fungus is supplied as spores (conidia) suspended in a liquid concentrate. Dilute the concentrate according to directions and use a sprayer to apply the spores to marijuana plants infested with mites, leafhoppers, or spittlebugs. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Verticillium lecanii


• Use for aphids and whiteflies



Verticillium lecanii is an entomopathogenic fungus that infects and kills insect pests. One specific strain (genetic variant) of this fungus kills aphids and another kills whiteflies. The provider should specify which is which.

When the fungal spores contact the insect pest, the spores germinate and grow directly into the insect’s body. The pest dies in four to fourteen days, and the fungus grows out of its corpse. As it grows, the fungus produces slimy spores that stick to and infect new victims.

This fungus arrives as spores in a wettable powder. Mix it with water according to directions and spray it on marijuana plants infested with aphids or whiteflies. Apply the spray at sunset, directly to the undersides of leaves of plants in their vegetative phase (that is, when plants are not flowering). The fungus is most effective in the temperature range of 59°F to 68°F (15°C to 20°C). It requires high humidity, around 80 percent, so avoid using it during the flowering phase of marijuana when the humidity needs to be lower. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Metarhizium anisopliae


• Use for aphids, large leaf-eating beetles, leafhoppers, and spittlebugs



This is a soil fungus with different specific strains for aphids, beetles, and leafhoppers or spittlebugs. The vendor should identify the strain.

Spores of this fungus penetrate insect skin directly on germination. Infected insect pests stop eating and die in four to fourteen days. If humidity is high enough (80 percent or higher), the fungus will reemerge from the corpses of its victims, produce new spores, and continue to infect the insect population.

The fungus is supplied as a powder or as granules in plastic bags, foil packets, or bottles. It can be stored for weeks in a refrigerator. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Beauveria bassiana


• Use for grasshoppers, true bugs, and whiteflies



Beauveria bassiana lives naturally in soils worldwide and kills many different kinds of insects.

Its fungal spores germinate and infect pests on contact, killing the pests in two to ten days. White fungus sprouts from the cadavers of the pests and produces spores that infect more pests. This fungus has an extremely wide range of insect victims, and numerous strains of the fungus have been produced for specific pests. Read the description of the product before purchasing to make sure you get one that treats the particular pests infesting your marijuana.

This fungus is supplied as spores dispersed in emulsified oil or as granules to be mixed with water. Mix it with water according to the directions on the package and apply as a spray. It can be stored up to two years in the dark at 45°F to 50°F (7°C to 10°C). Use it indoors or outdoors.





Trichoderma harzianum


• Use for anthracnose, charcoal rot, collar rot, damping off, fusarium foot and root rot, fusarium stem canker, fusarium wilt, gray mold, hemp canker, Phomopsis stem canker, southern blight, and verticillium wilt



This fungus is found in healthy, biologically active soils worldwide and is an active antagonist of numerous pathogenic fungi that populate the growing media around the rhizosphere (root zone).

Trichoderma harzianum is an effective mycorrhizal associate that forms colonies on plant root systems to enhance plant growth by improving root growth and function. In addition, the colonies fend off pathogenic fungi by excluding them and/or killing them.

Numerous strains of the fungus have been commercially developed and are available in a wide variety of products. Some are mixed with other Trichoderma species. Some strains are applied to the root systems of seedlings, in plants in the ground, or in containers. Other strains are sprayed on leaves and stems to control fungus disease on aboveground plant parts. Be sure to read the description of the product and its intended uses before you purchase it. It can be stored up to a year in the dark at 45°F to 50°F (7°C to 10°C). Use it indoors or outdoors.





Rhizophagus irregularis (formerly Glomus intraradices)


• Use for charcoal rot, collar rot, damping off, fusarium foot and root rot, fusarium wilt, and verticillium wilt



The name of this fungus was recently changed from Glomus intraradices to Rhizophagus irregularis, but it is still being produced and sold under the former name. This fungus is a mycorrhizal species that forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of plants such as marijuana.

Used as a growing media inoculant, this fungus enhances nutrient absorption and protects the marijuana plant from a variety of soilborne fungal pathogens.

The fungus is available as spores in a dry granular formulation. It can be stored for months in the dark at 45°F to 50°F (7°C to 10°C). Use it indoors or outdoors.





Pythium oligandrum


• Use for collar rot, damping off, and fusarium foot and root rot



Pythium oligandrum is an aggressive soil-dwelling mycoparasite that attacks and kills other fungi. It is closely related to plant pathogens Pythium aphanidermatum and P. ultimum; unlike its cousins, however, it does not harm your marijuana plants.

Pythium oligandrum protects your plants from plant pathogenic Pythium species that cause damping off of seedlings and cuttings. It parasitizes and kills other Pythium species and many other fungi as well, such as species of Botrytis and Fusarium.

It is supplied as spores in granules or powder and is used to coat seeds or as a growing media treatment. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Ampelomyces quisqualis


• Use for brown blight, powdery mildew, and Stemphylium leaf spot



This fungus attacks and kills other fungi. Specific strains of this fungus have been selected for their superior ability to control fungal pathogens such as powdery mildew.

It is available as dried spores (conidia) in granules that can be mixed with water or with horticultural oil and sprayed on marijuana plants. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Myrothecium verrucaria


• Use for root nematodes and stem nematodes



This widespread fungus lives in soils worldwide. It is an aggressive plant pathogen that decomposes cellulose, a major component of plant cells; however, commercial products have been developed that do not harm plants.

Certain strains of the fungus have been developed commercially for the control of nematodes. The fungus is grown in a laboratory and then killed. The dead fungus and the liquid in which it was grown are mixed together and dried. The mixture kills pathogenic root nematodes when applied to growing media. It does not harm beneficial nematodes.

The strains are supplied as dry granules or as a liquid suspension. Mix it into the growing media prior to planting, following the directions on the package. Use it indoors or outdoors.

NOTE: Beneficial nematodes to use are listed in order from easiest to obtain to more difficult to obtain.

Beneficial nematodes are microscopic roundworms that live in growing media or soil. Most beneficial species are entomopathogenic, which means they survive by killing and eating only insects. They attack and kill many insects that spend all or part of their life cycles underground. They do not attack plants—only insects.

Beneficial nematodes use two types of behaviors to find prey. Nematode behavior of the first type involves actively seeking prey by swimming through the growing media. These nematodes are called seekers, and they are very effective against insects that are stationary in the media, such as grubs and pupae. The other nematode behavior type involves lying in wait and ambushing prey. These nematodes, called ambushers, are very effective against prey that are mobile and move about. Some nematodes, such as Steinernema riobravis, use both behaviors to find prey.

Nematodes are alive when you receive them. You can keep them in a refrigerator for a couple of weeks if necessary, but it’s better to use them sooner. They arrive in trays in an insulated container. You mix the contents of the tray with water and sprinkle or spray it onto your growing media following instructions on the package. In general, apply them in the evening, because nematodes avoid light. The growing media temperature needs to be from 42°F to 90°F (6°C to 32°C). Use them indoors or outdoors.





Steinernema carpocapsae, S. feltiae, S. riobravis


• Use for cutworms and armyworms, and leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms



Cutworms and armyworms hide in the growing media as larvae. Budworms and leaf-eating caterpillars occupy the growing media as pupae. These pests are vulnerable to beneficial nematodes during the parts of their life cycle that they spend in the growing media. Because these pests are mobile, these ambusher nematode species work well.





Steinernema glaseri, S. riobravis, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora


• Use for beetle grubs, flea beetles (larvae), mole crickets, and weevil and curculio grubs and adults



Flea beetle larvae; beetle, weevil, and curculio grubs; and mole crickets all live in the growing media. Weevil and curculio adults often hide in the growing media during the daytime, making them vulnerable to beneficial nematodes. These seeker nematodes work well against these relatively stationary pests.





Steinernema feltiae, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora


• Use for fungus gnats (larvae) and root maggots



Root maggots (fly larvae) and fungus gnat larvae live in the growing media, pupate there, and emerge aboveground as adults. They are vulnerable to beneficial nematodes during the part of their life cycle when they live in the growing media. These seeker nematodes are best against these pests.





Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita


• Use for slugs and snails



This is the only commercially available beneficial nematode that is not a parasite of insects. This one infects and kills slugs and snails, but it is more effective on slugs than on snails. The nematodes can be stored and applied in the same way as the insect-killing beneficial nematodes.

NOTE: Beneficial bacteria to use are listed in order from easiest to obtain to more difficult to obtain.

Bacteria are ubiquitous, extremely small microorganisms that can be seen only through a microscope. Most are single-celled organisms, but a few grow in threads or filaments. Bacteria that grow in filaments are called actinomycetes. Every teaspoon of healthy soil contains as many as forty million bacterial cells. Inside your own body, there are more bacterial cells than human cells.

The beneficial bacteria listed here are valuable partners, as biopesticides that kill particular insect pests or fungal pathogens.





Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)


Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil-dwelling bacterium that occurs naturally in soils and on leaf surfaces. It is a spore-forming bacterium. When Bt makes spores, it produces a crystal protein that kills insects. Each strain of the bacterium differs in the kind of insecticidal protein it makes. Many strains of Bt have been identified for use against specific insect pests.





Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Btk)


• Use for boring caterpillars, cutworms and armyworms, leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms, and purslane sawflies (larvae)



Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki, or Btk, kills only caterpillars—with one exception: it also kills about 50 percent of purslane sawfly larvae (so if you have a hundred sawfly larvae, Btk will kill only fifty of them). The caterpillars (or sawfly larvae) eat the leaves containing Btk spores. Btk does not kill adult butterflies and moths, because they cannot chew leaves; their mouthparts are like straws that they use to suck up nectar from flowers.

When a caterpillar or insect larva eats a leaf or bud with Btk spores on it, the caterpillar sickens, stops eating immediately, and dies within a few days. Btk needs to be reapplied once a week while caterpillars are active. It is very effective against boring caterpillars, but only before they get inside the stems of your marijuana plants. Once they’re inside the stem, they’re protected.

The larvae of the purslane sawfly (found only in the state of Mississippi) resemble caterpillars but they are in a different taxonomic order of insects. Caterpillars, the larvae of butterflies and moths, are in the order Lepidoptera, while sawfly larvae are members of the order Hymenoptera. Nevertheless, Btk is 50 percent effective against this pest as well.

This bacterium is widely available as spores in a liquid, a dry powder, a granular formulation, or many other formulations. It is inexpensive and a valuable tool that kills any caterpillar that eats it but has no effect on beneficial insects. Apply it as a spray to cover all parts of the plant. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis (Btt)


• Use for flea beetles



Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis (Btt) is effective against certain beetles but has no effect on caterpillars. It is marketed for application to control Colorado potato beetles, but it also kills flea beetles on marijuana plants. The flea beetles eat the bacterial spores on the surface of leaves, sicken, and die.

This bacterium is widely available as spores in a liquid and possibly other formulations. Apply it as a spray to cover all parts of the plant. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti)


• Use for fungus gnats (larvae)



Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) is effective against fungus gnat larvae, mosquitoes, and certain other members of the order Diptera (true flies). The fungus gnat larvae eat the bacteria, sicken, and die. It has no effect on beetles or caterpillars.

Apply the bacterium to the surface of your growing media or use it as a drench (a mixture of bacteria and water) within the root zone of marijuana plants to kill the fungus gnat larvae munching on the roots. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Milky spore disease


Paenibacillus popilliae (formerly Bacillus popilliae)

• Use for beetle grubs, and weevil and curculio grubs



Although the scientific name of this bacterium recently changed, the former name, Bacillus popilliae, is still in use by some suppliers. It is marketed and sold as milky spore disease—so named because infected beetle, weevil, and curculio grubs turn milky white and die after becoming infected. This spore-forming, soil-dwelling bacterium is found worldwide.

Grubs living underground ingest the bacteria as they feed, and then sicken and die after about a month. The milky white corpses of dead grubs release millions of bacterial spores as they decompose, so that the disease persists in the growing media and controls future generations of grub pests.

The spores of the bacterium are supplied as a powder that you spread on the growing media. Water the growing media to move the bacterial spores down into the root zone. Note that this bacterium has no effect on adult insects eating the leaves of your plants; it works only on grubs chewing on the roots. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Bacillus subtilis


• Use for brown blight, collar rot, damping off, downy mildew, fusarium foot and root rot, fusarium stem canker, hemp canker, Phomopsis stem canker, powdery mildew, southern blight, Stemphylium leaf spot, and verticillium wilt



This spore-forming bacterium is found worldwide in healthy, biologically active soils. Many strains have been commercially developed to kill fungal pathogens.

Some strains of Bacillus subtilis are able to form epiphytic colonies (groups of bacteria that grow harmlessly on plants) on the surfaces of leaves and stems to protect aboveground plant parts from numerous airborne pathogenic fungi, such as powdery mildew. Other strains of this bacterium form colonies on the roots and live in the growing media to protect your plant from many soil-dwelling pathogenic fungi, such as Rhizoctonia species. Your supplier will specify what strains a commercial product contains and will specify which diseases to use it on.

Bacillus subtilis is available as spores dispersed in water, as a powder, or as dust. Be sure to read the product label to be certain the strain it contains is appropriate for the disease on which you intend to use it. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Pseudomonas fluorescens


• Use for collar rot, damping off, fusarium foot and root rot, fusarium stem canker, and Phomopsis stem canker



Pseudomonas fluorescens is a bacterium found worldwide, where it occupies numerous habitats in healthy soil and on aboveground parts of plants.

Several strains of this bacterium have been identified and cultured for use as biopesticides. Of particular use for marijuana are strains that are able to colonize plant roots symbiotically and suppress growing media–borne fungal pathogens, such as root rot. Your supplier will specify what strains a commercial product contains and will specify which diseases to use it on.

Spores are supplied in powder form. Apply the spores to seeds, use as a root system dip, or inoculate planting holes. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Streptomyces griseoviridis


• Use for collar rot, damping off, fusarium foot and root rot, fusarium stem canker, fusarium wilt, gray mold, Phomopsis stem canker, and verticillium wilt



This bacterium grows in filaments like a fungus. It’s actually an actinobacterium (actinomycete), a group of organisms that were once thought to be fungi because of their filamentous growth habit. This genus of bacteria is the original source of the antibiotic streptomycin.

Streptomyces griseoviridis forms symbiotic colonies on plant roots similar to a mycorrhizal fungus. It protects marijuana from fungal pathogens that cause root rot and damping off by releasing chemicals that kill the harmful fungi. It also produces growth hormones that stimulate plants to grow large and healthy with bigger, stronger root systems.

It is supplied as dried spores and fragments in powder. Treat seeds with the powder, or mix it with water for a root dip or a growing media drench (a mixture of bacteria and water). Follow directions on the package. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Streptomyces lydicus


• Use for collar rot, damping off, fusarium foot and root rot, gray mold, and powdery mildew



This bacterium is closely related to Streptomyces griseoviridis. It is also used to protect plants from pathogenic fungi, particularly the soilborne fungi that cause damping off. This one forms symbiotic colonies on aboveground plant parts as well as on the roots. On foliage it protects the plant from powdery mildew and gray mold.

The bacterial colonies on roots and leaves form an exclusion barrier against pathogenic fungi. In addition, the bacterium produces chemicals that weaken and kill fungal pathogens.

It is supplied as a wettable powder to be mixed with water, as granules to apply to the growing media, or as a mix for coating seeds. Mix Streptomyces lydicus with water and dip roots that have been cleaned of all growing media into the mixture to control root rot fungi. Alternatively, spray it on the foliage of your marijuana to control powdery mildew and gray mold. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Agrobacterium radiobacter


• Use for crown gall



Agrobacterium radiobacter is a soil-dwelling bacterium closely related to the pathogen that causes crown gall disease, A. tumefaciens. But A. radiobacter is not a pathogen—it is a biopesticide that protects your plants from its virulent cousin.

Agrobacterium radiobacter secretes a chemical (agrocin 84) that prevents the crown gall pathogen from growing by stopping its ability to reproduce. Crown gall is an odd disease that looks like plant cancer but generally does not kill your plants.

The bacterium will arrive as actively growing colonies on agar plates in petri dishes. You scrape the bacterial colonies off the agar, mix them with water, and spray the solution on the growing media surrounding your plants. You can also mix it with water and dip roots (cleaned of all growing media) or cuttings into the mixture to protect them. Follow the directions on the package. Use it indoors or outdoors.





USE BENEFICIAL PROTOZOA


Protozoa are single-celled organisms in the kingdom Protista. However, the product described below, which is distributed and sold as a protozoan, is actually a microsporidian fungus and not a protozoan at all.





Nosema locustae


• Use for crickets and grasshoppers



Recent research has revealed that Nosema locustae is a fungal pathogen that kills grasshoppers and crickets after they eat it. It will not harm pets, people, or the environment.

Once a grasshopper or cricket has eaten N. locustae, it gets very sick, stops eating, and slowly dies. Healthy grasshoppers are cannibals, and when they eat the corpses of their infected fellows, they, too, get sick and die, spreading the fungal disease through the grasshopper population.

This product arrives incorporated into tasty bait that grasshoppers and crickets love to eat. Spread the bait on the ground anywhere these insects are damaging your plants. Use it indoors or outdoors.





USE INSECTICIDAL VIRUSES


NPV (nuclear polyhedrosis virus)


• Use for boring caterpillars, cutworms and armyworms, and leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms



The majority of caterpillars that eat your marijuana plants are the larvae of noctuid moths, and NPV infects and kills noctuid moth larvae. This virus has no effect on other creatures, such as monarch butterfly caterpillars—it kills only noctuid caterpillars and is harmless to humans, pets, and other animals. Other kinds of commercially prepared insecticidal viruses are also available, such as stunt viruses, granulosis viruses, and cytoplasmic polyhedrosis viruses (CPVs). These viruses are applied and work in ways similar to NPV, but they kill caterpillars other than noctuids.

After you spray this virus onto your marijuana, the caterpillars ingest the virus particles as they eat your plants. After they eat the virus, they get sick, stop eating, go limp, turn dark, and die. The process of dying takes about a week and the corpses hang on your plants. The carcasses of the victims are infective and spread more virus particles throughout the caterpillar population. Young, small caterpillars are more susceptible to the virus than older, bigger ones. Boring noctuid caterpillars are also susceptible while young, before they get safely inside your plants. Once inside the stem, they are protected.





The corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea), a budworm, is the larva of a destructive noctuid moth and is killed by NPV.

A number of NPV products are commercially available as either liquid concentrates or wettable powders. Mix them with water following manufacturer’s directions and spray them on your plants. Use them indoors or outdoors.





CHAPTER NINE


USE ORGANIC CHEMICAL REMEDIES




If your marijuana plants are experiencing a pest or disease problem, you should first review all the growing conditions and repair any situation causing plant stress. Refer to chapter seven and chapters ten through sixteen and correct any problems stemming from too little light, insufficient water, or inadequate nutrients, for example. Second, use biological controls (chapter eight), because they leave no residues on your plants and they are extremely effective. Finally, as a last resort, you can apply a chemical remedy. All the remedies listed here are organic and certified by the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI).

Be aware that even organic remedies can have negative consequences to your health, so protect yourself with appropriate gear. And be careful what you put on the buds or leaves you intend to harvest for consumption.





SAFETY FIRST


Think of your marijuana as a food crop. After all, you intend to ingest, inhale, or absorb it into your body (or you are providing it for someone else who intends to consume it in one of these ways). It makes no sense to lace your food with poison before you eat it or smoke it. For this reason, keep the following in mind before you use any chemicals on your plants:

• Keep all products out of the reach of children and pets.

• Read the label. Use only organic chemicals listed for food plants.



All the chemical remedies in this book are safe to use on food plants. If you choose to use a different product, check the label. If the label doesn’t list food crops, or states something like “For use on ornamentals,” do not use it on your marijuana. Every package or bottle of a remedy has a label on the back that peels open. Unfold it and read the tiny print inside to learn what the product is used for, which plants to use it on, when to use it, and how much to use. Some of these labels unfold into long pages of instructions. Get out your magnifying glass, be patient, and read them carefully.

Evaluate your circumstances to choose the right product for your plants. Do not apply them according to a predetermined schedule. Instead, observe your plants and use chemicals only as necessary.

Follow the directions on the label. Remember that more is not better. Many chemicals can actually cause a phytotoxic reaction that damages plants. It is important that you read the label and follow the manufacturer’s instructions. If you put too much of the active ingredient on your plant, you do more harm than good.

Always use the least toxic product first. Look for a signal word on the label, and use products with signal words (Caution, Warning, Danger) only when you need them:

• Caution is the least toxic.

• Warning is more toxic.

• Danger is the most toxic.

In the United States, these signal words are required by law under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the registration authority for pesticides. All commercially sold pesticides must be registered with the EPA and tested for modes of transmission into the body: inhalation, ingestion, dermal contact, primary eye, and primary skin.

Many products, such as baking soda spray and insecticidal soap, are not required to present a signal word on the label and are the safest, least toxic products you can use.

Products labeled with the signal word Danger/Poison and an image of a skull and crossbones are the most toxic of all. These are not organic remedies. They are available only to licensed pesticide applicators. In the following tables, the remedies are listed from least toxic to most toxic, but all are approved as organic remedies.

Wear protective gear and clothing when you work with these remedies. Wear goggles, a respiratory face mask, a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, gloves, and shoes. Wash your clothes when you are finished using any product with the signal words Caution, Warning, or Danger.

Kaolin


• Use for aphids, leafhoppers, mites, and thrips

• Signal word: None



Kaolin, a soft clay, is one of the prime ingredients in fine porcelain. The finest grade of kaolin, finer than flour, is used for agricultural and horticultural purposes. Insects are unable to recognize a plant as a place to lay eggs or as food when it’s coated in white clay. Because kaolin repels pests, you need to use it before the pests show up.

Kaolin comes as a dry powder you mix with water and spray on your plants. It dries to a white clay coating that repels insects but does not kill them. Use kaolin when the foliage is dry, and keep in mind that rain will wash it away. Use it on marijuana in the vegetative phase only. The product is manufactured and sold under many trade names. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Hot-pepper spray


• Use for aphids, boring beetles, cutworms and armyworms, flea beetles, large leaf-eating beetles, leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms, mammals, and weevils and curculios

• Signal word: None



Hot chile peppers contain capsaicin, a compound that gives them their fiery flavor. We humans love that taste in hot sauce, but other mammals are repelled by it. Insects are both repelled and killed by it (if it’s sprayed directly on the pest). It is not toxic to people, pets, and birds. Pepper spray is a nontargeted remedy, so it kills beneficial organisms as well as pests.

You can buy a commercial product, but pepper spray is easy to make at home. You can even combine hot chile peppers with garlic.

Be sure to wear gloves and protective clothing when making this product. Do not breathe the mist into your lungs or get it in your eyes or on your lips; it is very irritating. Do not use it on your marijuana when it’s flowering, because the hot pepper will make your buds taste very hot.

To make pepper spray concentrate, you’ll need two habanero, jalapeño, serrano, or any other hot pepper variety in the Capsicum genus. Habaneros (Scotch bonnets) are by far the hottest.

1. Put two peppers in a blender with 2 cups (0.5 liter) of water and liquefy them, seeds and all.

2. Pour the blended peppers into a 1-gallon (4 liter) container.

3. Add water to fill the container. This makes a concentrate. Let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours.

4. Filter out any particulates with a sieve.

5. To use, add ¼ cup (60 ml) of the concentrate to 1 gallon (4 liters) of water along with 2 tablespoons of liquid castile soap. Use soap, not dish detergent. The soap acts as a spreader-sticker to help the pepper spray cover the surface of the leaves. Be aware that the addition of soap increases the ability of this product to kill insects—beneficial ones as well as pests.

6. Apply the hot-pepper spray with a sprayer and cover all surfaces of your plants.



The spray retains its efficacy for several days, even when dry. You’ll need to reapply weekly until the pests are gone. If you choose to use a commercially prepared hot-pepper spray, follow the directions provided by the vendor. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Garlic spray


• Use for boring beetles, cutworms and armyworms, flea beetles, large leaf-eating beetles, leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms, mammals, weevils and curculios, and whiteflies

• Signal word: None



Garlic repels a number of pests, from insects to deer—and, allegedly, vampires. Make your own garlic spray or purchase a commercial preparation. Garlic is easy to use, relatively nontoxic, and, best of all, it works well. Commercially made products are commonly prepared as a liquid that you spray on your plants. Do not use it routinely as a general preventive spray; instead, use it only when you know that pests are present.

Do not use garlic spray on your marijuana when it’s flowering, because the garlic will alter the aroma and taste of your buds. Do not breathe the mist into your lungs or get it in your eyes or on your lips. Wear protective gear and clothing.

To make your own garlic spray, you’ll need six or more peeled cloves of garlic. In a blender, add the garlic to 1 quart (1 liter) of water and liquefy. Then strain the liquid.

Add 2 tablespoons of liquid castile soap (not dish detergent) as a spreader-sticker to help the spray cover the surface of the leaves if you wish, but take note: the soap will make the product kill insects, including beneficial ones.

To use, put the liquid in a sprayer or spray bottle and spray all sides of your plants. The garlic retains its efficacy as a repellent for several days, even when dry. Reapply weekly. If you choose to use a commercially prepared garlic spray, follow the directions provided by the vendor. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Baking soda spray


• Use for anthracnose, black dot, brown blight, brown leaf spot, Chaetomium fungi, charcoal rot, Cladosporium stem canker, downy mildew, fusarium stem canker, gray mold, hemp canker, olive leaf spot, Ophiobolus stem canker, pepper spot, Phomopsis stem canker, powdery mildew, southern blight, stem cankers, Stemphylium leaf spot, twig blight, white leaf spot, and yellow leaf spot

• Signal word: None



Baking soda comes in two forms: potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Both are natural minerals. The sodium bicarbonate form is more common in nature and comes from mineral springs. It’s the baking soda in your kitchen cupboard. Potassium bicarbonate is rarely found in nature and is manufactured by combining potassium carbonate, carbon dioxide, and water. You can obtain it from horticultural supply companies.

Both bicarbonates protect against fungal diseases on your marijuana. They don’t cure fungal infections, but you can use them as preventative measures. Research shows that both sodium and potassium bicarbonates cause the cell walls of fungi to collapse. The exact action is unknown. They also raise the pH on the surface of leaves, making them more alkaline and inhospitable to fungal spores, preventing fungal spores from germinating on the leaf.

Baking soda has no known side effects for people, other mammals, insects, or fish. Some plants may be sensitive to this mixture, however. To test the reaction of your specific marijuana strain, always spray a few leaves and wait a day or two before wide application. Baking soda spray may leave a slight residue on the plant as well.

Choose potassium bicarbonate if you can, because potassium is a major plant nutrient—in other words, a fertilizer. Sodium bicarbonate can lead to higher concentrations of sodium in the growing media and may eventually cause plant problems.

Vendors carry ready-to-use products. If you choose to use a commercially prepared product, follow the instructions provided by the vendor.

To make your own simple baking soda spray, add 1 tablespoon of baking soda (potassium or sodium bicarbonate) to 1 gallon (4 liters) of water.

Add this simple baking soda remedy to a sprayer and spray your plants thoroughly, covering all sides of leaves, buds, and stems. Spray your plants as soon as symptoms appear and repeat every two weeks to protect new growth. Use it on plants in the vegetative or flowering phase. Reapply if rain or overhead watering washes it off the leaves. Use it indoors or outdoors.

You can make a complex baking soda spray by adding 1 tablespoon of liquid castile soap (not dish detergent) to the basic recipe to act as a spreader-sticker to help the spray cover the surface of the leaves. Be aware, however, that adding soap makes the mixture an insecticide as well as a fungicide, and it will kill beneficial insects as well as pest insects and fungi.

Add horticultural oil to the mix to increase the insecticidal and fungicidal properties of baking soda spray. Use this complex baking soda spray in the same way as the simple solution, but do not spray this mixture on flower buds, because it will leave a residue of soap and oil on the buds. To add horticultural oil, you must also add the soap to emulsify the oil. Mix together 1 tablespoon of liquid castile soap (not dish detergent), 1 tablespoon of horticultural oil, and 1 gallon (4 liters) of simple baking soda spray.





Insecticidal soap


• Use for aphids, boring beetles, cutworms and armyworms, earwigs, flea beetles, fungus gnats, large leaf-eating beetles, leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms, leafhoppers, mealybugs, mites, scale, spittlebugs, thrips, true bugs, weevils and curculios, and whiteflies

• Signal word: None



When an acid is chemically combined with a base, the result is a chemical salt. In this case, the acid is a vegetable oil or animal fat (both of which consist of fatty acids). The base is lye, which is potassium hydroxide (KOH) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Fat plus lye equals soap. Commercial insecticidal soaps list the active ingredient as “potassium salts of fatty acids”—in other words, soap.

A mixture of soap and water sprayed directly on insects kills them quickly. When you get an insect wet with soapy water, the soap penetrates the insect’s protective skin (cuticle), causes their cells to collapse, and they die.

Soap is a broad-spectrum insecticide and miticide that kills beneficial insects such as lady beetles (ladybugs), honeybees, green lacewings, and others, if you get them wet with it. Protect beneficial critters by spraying only the insects you want to kill. Insecticidal soap is not toxic to mammals or birds, it degrades rapidly in growing media, and it is not harmful to aquatic organisms or ecosystems.

Insecticidal soaps are commercially available as ready-to-use products in handy spray bottles. Concentrates that you mix with water and apply with a pump sprayer are also available. Spray pest insects and mites when and where you see them. Get the insects soaking wet. Repeat as necessary. Soap has no residual activity, so once it dries, it is no longer effective. Use insecticidal soap on marijuana in the vegetative phase, and do not use it on your flower buds. Follow the recommendations provided by the manufacturer. Use it indoors or outdoors.

If you want to make your own liquid spray, first get some soap. It pays to be careful here, because many of the things we call soap, such as dishwashing liquid, are actually detergents (synthetic chemicals) that are more toxic to plants than soap. Look for a product such as pure liquid castile soap, which is available in most grocery stores.

To make the spray, add 1 tablespoon of liquid soap to 1 quart (1 liter) of water. Apply this homemade spray as you would a commercial product. Use a spray bottle or a pump-type pressure sprayer and drench the pests with this mixture.





Neem


• Use for aphids, boring beetles, boring caterpillars, crickets, cutworms and armyworms, flea beetles, fungus gnats, grasshoppers, hemp sawflies, large leaf-eating beetles, leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms, leafhoppers, leaf miners, mealybugs, mites, mole crickets, powdery mildew, root maggots, root nematodes, scale, spittlebugs, stem nematodes, thrips, true bugs, weevils and curculios, and whiteflies

• Signal word: Caution



Neem is extracted from the seeds of the neem (Azadirachta indica), an evergreen tree endemic to India. The seeds of the neem tree are poisonous. Neem oil is extracted by crushing seeds, usually in a cold-press process.

Neem is a fungicide, insecticide, and miticide. As a soil drench (a mixture of neem and water), it also kills root nematodes.

As a fungicide, it inhibits fungal spores from germinating and prevents fungal infections, so it is a preventative measure, not a cure. As an insecticide, it has three different effects on insect populations:

• Neem sends some pests the signal “Do not gather here,” so the pests go away.

• Neem prevents some insect pests from molting so they cannot mature.

• Neem prevents some insect pests from laying eggs so they cannot reproduce.

As a miticide, neem prevents mites from molting and laying eggs. It also causes them to stop feeding and prevents their eggs from hatching.

Neem is nontoxic to mammals. The EPA considers it safe to use indoors. However, the smell can be quite objectionable.

Follow the directions provided by the vendor. Neem oil by itself will not mix with water, but commercial preparations contain a surfactant that enables the oil to disperse in water. Mix the neem preparation with water and spray the plant thoroughly every seven to fourteen days, as needed. Use this same mixture and drench the growing media thoroughly to kill root nematodes. Be aware that neem can be phytotoxic if overused.





Iron phosphate


• Use for slugs and snails

• Signal word: Caution



Iron phosphate is a natural ingredient found in soil and is composed of the mineral elements iron and phosphorus combined with oxygen. Commercially, it is used in fertilizers and as a molluscicide (under several brand names) that kills snails and slugs.

Iron phosphate is added to an attractant (bait) to induce snails and slugs to eat it. They eat it, get sick, and stop feeding. It takes several days for them to die. However, the damage to your plants will have stopped because they stop eating. Generally, they crawl away to hide and die, so you will not see large numbers of dead or dying snails or slugs after you apply this product. You will, however, notice that your plants are doing much better and are sustaining much less damage than before.

Read the label and follow directions. It is safe to use on all plants. Scatter it on the ground near your marijuana plants. It will lure slugs and snails out of hiding and they will eat it. Apply it to moist soil. If the soil is dry, wet it down before scattering the product, but do not apply it to standing water. It can cause moderate eye irritation, so wash your hands thoroughly after applying this product. It does not harm pets, wildlife, or other terrestrial nontarget organisms, but it may affect aquatic systems. Do not apply it directly to water or dispose of it in water. Use it up to the day of harvest. Uneaten, it will degrade into fertilizer and become part of the soil. Use it indoors or outdoors.

CAUTION

Many growers have relied for years on an older generation of molluscicide products containing metaldehyde, which is poisonous to pets, wildlife, and children as well as to slugs and snails. We cannot and do not recommend the use of these nonorganic older products. Iron phosphate is by far the better choice.





Horticultural oil


• Use for aphids, leaf miners, mealybugs, mites, powdery mildew, root maggots, scale, and true bugs, and whiteflies

• Signal word: Caution



Horticultural oil is manufactured commercially from a vegetable oil such as soybean oil or from petroleum. Never use petroleum products on your marijuana. Instead, use modern vegetable oil products that are very light, highly refined oils and that are OMRI certified for organic gardening.

Horticultural oil coats, smothers, and kills insects and mites as well as their eggs. It also smothers and kills powdery mildew.

Read the label and follow directions. Ready-made horticultural oil products contain an emulsifier that enables the oil to mix with water. Mix the emulsified horticultural oil with water and apply by spraying. Be sure to coat the plant thoroughly, because these products work on contact. Insects, mites, and their eggs have to be covered in oil for it to kill them.

Marijuana can be sensitive to oils, especially in high temperatures. Test spray a small portion of your plants and wait a few days to make sure they are able to tolerate the treatment. Light yellowing of the foliage is a symptom of sensitivity.

Use horticultural oils only when temperatures are below 85°F (29°C) in the daytime and above freezing at night. Do not apply any oils to drought-stressed plants. Make sure your plants are well hydrated before you treat them with oil, and do not apply oils to buds. If you treat your plants with sulfur, do not use horticultural oil for one month before and after using the sulfur. The combination of oil and sulfur is harmful to green leaves and will damage them, causing a severe phytotoxic reaction.

Wear protective clothing, goggles, and a respiratory mask when using horticultural oil. Protect your pets and your children while spraying. Oil can be harmful if swallowed or absorbed through the skin. Prolonged skin contact can cause allergic reactions and moderate eye irritation. Avoid breathing the mist. Oils are toxic to fish. Do not apply directly to water. Use it indoors or outdoors.

You can make your own horticultural oil with a vegetable oil such as canola oil, to which you add an emulsifier such as soap. Be sure to use a true soap (such as castile), not a detergent. To make the oil, add 1 tablespoon of liquid castile soap and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to 1 gallon (4 liters) of water.

Use the homemade oil as you would a commercial product. Always test spray a small area of your plant to be sure it can tolerate the application, and wait a few days before making a wider application. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Diatomaceous earth


• Use for ants, crickets, earwigs, grasshoppers, mole crickets, slugs and snails, and weevils and curculios

• Signal word: Caution



Diatomaceous earth is a white powder with a gritty feel. It comes from diatoms, microscopic algae whose skeletons comprise silicon dioxide, the same material in glass and quartz. These algae are found everywhere on Earth in fresh and salt water and in moist soil. Where ancient seas or lakes have dried up, diatom skeletons have built up to thick deposits that are mined.

Select diatomaceous earth that is labeled for use as an insecticide to protect against crawling insects. Some diatomaceous earth products are used for filters for swimming pools and are ineffective against insects.

To an insect, diatomaceous earth is sharp, like ground glass. An insect, slug, or snail that tries to walk or slither across it will be wounded by the sharp particles and will die. It is unlikely to affect mammals, birds, or aquatic organisms that do not crawl on the ground. However, you must wear proper gear to protect yourself while applying it. Because it is a fine powder, particles float in the air and can get into your eyes and lungs. Wear a face mask to avoid breathing it, and wear goggles. Wear gloves, a long-sleeved shirt, and pants to keep diatomaceous earth off your skin, because it can be an irritant. Once it’s on the soil, it tends to stay put and won’t float in the air and get in your lungs.

Pour the powder onto the growing media around your plants to protect against crawling insects. It keeps ants from bringing aphids to your plants and is effective against insects such as weevils and earwigs that crawl up the stem every night and return to the soil at dawn to hide. The powder is most effective when it’s dry. Place it under boards, upside-down pots, or other objects propped about ½ inch (13 mm) off the ground to keep it dry. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Spinosad


• Use for boring beetles, cutworms and armyworms, earwigs, flea beetles, large leaf-eating beetles, leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms, leaf miners, thrips, and weevils and curculios

• Signal word: Caution



Spinosad is a mix of poisons (spinosyn A and spinosyn B) that kill insects by disrupting their nervous systems. These toxins are produced by Saccharopolyspora spinosa, a filamentous bacterium (actinomycete). The bacteria are cultured in a laboratory and their toxins are suspended in a liquid solution. Toxicity to people, pets, or birds is very low.

Spray it on your plants. When the insect eats the leaves or stems, it ingests the toxic substances, sickens, and dies. Spinosad also kills insects by contact, so they don’t have to eat it. It kills beneficial insects as well as pests, so use it only when you know you have a serious pest problem. Because the product remains toxic on foliage up to a week, it could easily kill beneficial insect partners. Do not spray it on water. It is moderately toxic to some species of fish and highly toxic to Eastern oysters.

It’s best to use this product in the late afternoon. Because it breaks down in sunlight you may need to reapply it weekly until the pest population is reduced to acceptable levels. It is available as a ready-made liquid spray or as a powder that you mix with water. Follow directions on the label. Wear protective gear, and avoid getting it in your eyes or breathing it into your lungs. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Copper


• Use for anthracnose, black dot, brown blight, brown leaf spot, Chaetomium fungi, charcoal rot, Cladosporium stem canker, downy mildew, fusarium stem canker, gray mold, hemp canker, olive leaf spot, Ophiobolus stem canker, pepper spot, Phomopsis stem canker, powdery mildew, southern blight, stem cankers, Stemphylium leaf spot, twig blight, white leaf spot, and yellow leaf spot

• Signal word: Caution



Copper is a natural mineral element mined from the earth. It has been used as a pesticide for more than two hundred years. Copper hydroxide and copper sulfate are the two forms used to protect plants from infection by various fungi.

Copper is a natural and very effective preventative fungicide that keeps fungal spores from germinating; therefore, it is a preventative measure, not a cure. The copper compounds made to protect plants from fungus are as effective as synthetic fungicides. It is one of the few products that also fights off bacterial infections.

Copper is slightly toxic to humans: it irritates eyes and skin, and it is poisonous if ingested in sufficient quantity. When working with it, use adequate protection (goggles, respirator, gloves, long sleeves, and long pants). Copper is highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates, fish, and amphibians. Do not use it near water. Copper can damage plants if they remain wet too long after copper spray application. According to standards set for certified organic growing, you can use copper up to one day before harvesting marijuana. Do not spray copper on buds, however.

Follow the directions on the label. Copper compounds are available as ready-to-use liquids, as wettable powders, and as dust. Mix the wettable powder with water and a spreader-sticker such as liquid castile soap. A spreader-sticker helps the spray cover the surface of the leaves. Some ready-to-use sprays already have the spreader-sticker in them and some do not, so check the label. Apply the liquids with spray bottles or pump sprayers. Use specially made plant dusters to apply the dust. If you apply copper compounds at the first signs of infection, they prevent additional infections. Apply them early in the morning so that the leaves can dry quickly. Use them indoors or outdoors.





Sulfur


• Use for powdery mildew and rust fungus

• Signal word: Caution



Sulfur is a yellow mineral mined from the earth, and it is a naturally occurring element, like oxygen, nitrogen, or iron. It’s one of the oldest known pesticides: ancient Greeks and Romans used sulfur to control fungal diseases on grains and other crops.

Sulfur prevents fungal spores from germinating. Tests have shown that sulfur controls fungal disease on a wide range of plants. Though it is not a cure, it works as well as synthetic fungicides to limit the spread of fungal pathogens, and it is particularly effective on rust fungi.

Sulfur is somewhat toxic to mammals like us, so wear protective gear to keep it out of your eyes and lungs and off your skin. If you have asthma or other allergies, you may be sensitive to sulfur. Sulfur can kill beneficial insects and fish, so use it when beneficial bugs are less active (that is, when it is cool outside) and keep it away from ponds, streams, and lakes.

Sulfur can harm your plants in two circumstances: when it is too hot, or when you have recently sprayed your plants with horticultural oil. Do not use sulfur if the temperature is above 80°F (27°C), and avoid using sulfur for one month before and after using horticultural oil on your plant. Furthermore, if you use sulfur regularly, it can build up in the growing media and make it more acidic.

Follow the instructions on the label. Sulfur is available as a ready-to-use spray, as a concentrate that you mix with water, or as a dust. Apply it thoroughly to all aboveground plant parts except flower buds. To prevent new infections, you must apply sulfur before fungal spores spread. You may need to apply it fairly frequently, every seven to fourteen days, because it washes off the plant. Use it indoors or outdoors.





Pyrethrin


• Use for leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms, leafhoppers, spittlebugs, true bugs, and whiteflies

• Signal word: Caution



Pyrethrin is a natural botanical insecticide made from the dried flowers of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium, a perennial flower related to the garden chrysanthemum. This plant was formerly known as Pyrethrum coccineum and P. cinerariaefolium, and the dried natural product obtained from this plant and available commercially still carries the older name of the plant, pyrethrum.

Pyrethrin is made from pyrethrum flowers. The flower heads are harvested, dried, and then ground into powder. The active ingredients are extracted from the powder. Pyrethrin is a mixture of several different chemicals that act as broad-spectrum nerve poisons that paralyze and kill certain insects on contact. It does not kill all insects, because some insects have enzymes that detoxify the natural chemicals so that they recover after their initial paralysis.

Pyrethrin is mildly toxic to mammals and is harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms. Although it is considered one of the safest pesticides to use in the home around food, people with asthma or hay fever may need to be cautious, because it may cause allergic reactions.

Read the label and apply according to instructions. Pyrethrin is generally applied as a liquid spray. It is available as ready-to-use handheld spray bottles at garden centers everywhere and as concentrates that you mix with water and apply with a spray bottle or pump sprayer. Protect yourself with appropriate clothing and safety wear when spraying.

Spray plants thoroughly, including leaf undersides and top sides. The dried product on the leaves and stems of your plants retains its potency for several days. It affects beneficial as well as harmful insects. Use it indoors or outdoors.

BEWARE OF NONORGANIC VERSIONS

Synthetic versions of natural pyrethrins, pyrethroids, are nonorganic and not recommended. Also, be aware that some commercial products contain nonorganic additives to boost the potency of the natural product, such as piperonyl butoxide, which is a synergist (a somewhat toxic compound by itself that acts in concert with another compound to make the combination more toxic than either component used alone). Do not use these products on your marijuana plants.





STOP USING HERBICIDES


If you (or your neighbor) use herbicides to control weeds when the wind is blowing, the spray can easily drift to your growing area and contaminate your plants. You should definitely not use herbicides if you’re growing marijuana. If marijuana plants received only a light dose from a spray drift, they are likely to recover; however, the damaged areas will never recover. Remove the damaged areas if you want, but leaving them on the plants will not cause further harm. If plants receive a heavy dose of herbicide, they will not recover.





MOVE AFFECTED CONTAINER PLANTS INDOORS


If you’re growing your marijuana in pots outdoors and your plants develop symptoms of herbicide damage, move them indoors. If they got a light dose from spray drift, your plants will recover and begin to grow normally. Each damaged leaf, however, will never recover. Remove these if you want to, but their presence will not cause further harm. If plants got a heavy dose of herbicide, they will not recover.





STOP USING PESTICIDES


Even organic pesticides cause phytotoxic reactions when these chemicals are used too often or at concentrations that are too high. The symptoms discussed in the problem-solving guide are phytotoxic reactions. Always keep a record of which pesticide was applied when and at what concentration. That way, you can check your spray record to find the likely culprit, and stop using it for a while. Before you resume using the pesticide, assuming you want to, give your plants a break of at least a week. Then lower your dosage and frequency. Follow the guidelines in this chapter and read product labels carefully.





WASH PESTICIDE RESIDUE OFF PLANTS


Wash pesticides off the plants with clean water from a hose. If the pesticides are oil based, such as neem or horticultural oil, use soapy water to clean your plants. Be sure to use soap, such as liquid castile soap, rather than a detergent, such as dishwashing liquid. Detergents can badly damage your plants.





CHAPTER TEN


CREATE HEALTHY GROWING CONDITIONS




Marijuana is an annual weed. In a single growing season, a seed-grown plant can grow to 12 feet (4 m) tall before flowering, setting seeds, and dying. It’s a tough plant that grows in many parts of the world as feral hemp, where no humans provide it with sprays, fertilizers, supplemental water, or extra light. The specially bred modern strains with maximum THC and/or CBD may be somewhat more finicky than their wild cousins, but even these new varieties are hardy plants.

That said, if your plants are beset with problems and failing to thrive, a poor growing environment could be to blame. By giving plants the best growing conditions, you minimize stress and maximize yield. It’s good for cannabis, good for your pocketbook, and good for the planet.





PLANT POLYCULTURES


Wild marijuana does so well on its own because of its inherent strength and its natural community. These communities are polycultures that feature high species diversity, structural complexity, and healthy, biologically active soil. These characteristics provide food, shelter, and reproductive sites for countless beneficial critters that help control pests and pathogens that may harm your plants. Mimicking healthy plant communities creates the best growing conditions and proves to be the best preventative measure and the most cost-effective way to keep plants healthy.

In a polyculture, lots of different kinds of plants grow adjacent to each other; in a monoculture, plants are all the same. In this case, that monoculture would consist of cannabis and nothing else, like a typical field of corn. By planting polycultures, you immediately create two important characteristics of natural plant communities: species diversity and complex structure. Choose plants from different families to establish species diversity. Choose plants that differ in height, width, rooting depth, flower color, and season of bloom to build complex structure.

Flowers and herbs are more than pretty faces and tasty treats. This diverse community, with varying structure, provides food and habitat for beneficial organisms. In addition, this community of plants lures useful predators, such as lady beetles, green lacewings, minute pirate bugs, and trichogramma wasps, to your crop. These predators seek out and destroy threatening pests. The habitat you create also offers a safe haven for beneficial fungi and bacteria, such as Trichoderma harzianum, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas fluorescens, that help protect your crop from pathogenic fungi and bacteria that cause diseases.





Mimic natural plant communities to bring beneficial organisms into your marijuana patch. These four natural plant communities—grassland, oak woodland, chaparral, and coniferous forest—make up a polyculture, a self-sustaining ecosystem.





Species diversity, exemplified here by artichoke, chives, calendula, kale, and dahlia, contributes one aspect of natural plant communities. Structural complexity, provided by trees such as Western red cedar, shrubs such as artichoke, and groundcovers such as herbs, creates habitat for beneficial organisms.





Fennel flowers attract and feed many beneficial insects such as this adult parasitic wasp, which eats pollen and lays her eggs inside leaf-eating caterpillars.





BEST COMPANION PLANTS FOR A POLYCULTURE


Several plants do the best job of attracting beneficial insects and creating a healthy polyculture environment. Choose those that work best in your climate and circumstances.





Asteraceae (sunflower family)


• Achillea millefolium, yarrow

• Aster species and hybrids, aster

• Baccharis species, baccharis

• Boltonia asteroides, boltonia

• Coreopsis species, tickseed

• Cosmos bipinnatus, cosmos

• Echinacea purpurea, purple coneflower

• Eupatorium perfoliatum, boneset

• Gaillardia aristata, blanketflower

• Helianthus annuus, sunflower

• Leucanthemum × superbum, Shasta daisy

• Ratibida pinnata, prairie coneflower

• Rudbeckia species, black-eyed Susan

• Solidago species, goldenrod

• Symphyotrichum species, hardy aster

• Tagetes species and hybrids, marigold

• Zinnia elegans and hybrids, zinnia





Apiaceae (carrot family)


• Ammi majus, laceflower or bishop’s weed

• Anethum graveolens, dill

• Angelica species, angelica

• Coriandrum sativum, cilantro or coriander

• Daucus carota, Queen Anne’s lace

• Foeniculum species, fennel

• Petroselinum crispum, parsley

• Zizia aptera, heartleaf Alexanders

• Zizia aurea, golden Alexanders





Many pollinators and other beneficial insects come to purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) to feed on nectar.





Lamiaceae (mint family)


• Nepeta × faassenii, catmint

• Ocimum basilicum, basil

• Origanum species, oregano

• Pycnanthemum species, mountain mint

• Rosmarinus officinalis, rosemary

• Salvia officinalis, culinary sage

• Thymus species, thyme





Other plant families


• Eriogonum species, native buckwheat

• Lobularia maritima, sweet alyssum

• Phacelia tanacetifolia, lacy phacelia

• Spiraea alba, meadowsweet

• Veronicastrum virginicum, Culver’s root





This wild solitary native bee illustrates the diversity of beneficial partners attracted by herbs in the mint family, such as this oregano.





Create polycultures outdoors in the ground


To create polycultures outdoors in the ground, you can add one extra row of companion flowers and herbs per about five rows of marijuana and/or surround your patch with a border of beneficial flowers and herbs. Put beneficial flowers and herbs in the same row as your marijuana plants. In this case, select small, shallow-rooted plants (such as thyme, oregano, marigold, tickseed, Queen Anne’s lace, or cilantro) so that your marijuana does not have to compete for nutrients, sunlight, and water.





Create polycultures outdoors in containers


Do not plant flowers or herbs in the same pot as your marijuana. Cannabis is a heavy feeder and wants all the nutrients, sunlight, and water it can get. It will not be as productive if it has to compete with another plant for those resources in the restricted environment of a container. Instead, plant some extra pots with beneficial flowers and herbs, and place them next to your pots of marijuana plants. Shift pots around to find the best environment for each kind of plant.





Create polycultures indoors in containers


Indoors, you avoid many of the pests and pathogens that plague outdoor plots. However, even indoors your plants might be hosts to spider mites, aphids, scale, powdery mildew, gray mold, and other pests and diseases. Pests hitchhike into your grow room or greenhouse on your clothing or on your pets. They can also ride the breeze and float or fly through windows, vents, and doors. If you release any of the beneficial insects and mites covered in chapter eight to deal with these problems, put pots of flowers in the grow room or greenhouse to provide extra food and habitat for these beneficial creatures.





Even in containers, you can create polycultures with species diversity and structural complexity.





CHOOSE GENETICALLY RESISTANT PLANTS


Breeding for disease and pest resistance in marijuana is a new development that will likely become increasingly important in the future. Genetically resistant cultivars developed through classic plant breeding (not GMOs) have proven their worth in numerous vegetable and fruit crops. There is no reason to suspect that marijuana is any different. It is well worth your while to search out genetically resistant plants by contacting professional and hobby breeders in your area or online and question them about disease and pest resistance. When you purchase seeds or plants, ask the vendor about genetic resistance.





DO NOT PLANT NEAR CERTAIN OTHER CROPS


Some plants may host a range of pests and diseases that can damage your marijuana. For this reason, you should choose a growing location that is not in close proximity to crops such as the following:

• corn (Zea mays) for boring caterpillars, European corn borers, hemp borers, and leaf-eating caterpillars and budworms

• eggplant (Solanum melongena) for flea beetles and whiteflies

• sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) for whiteflies

• tobacco (Nicotiana species) for whiteflies

• cotton (Gossypium species) for whiteflies

• any member of the cucumber family (Cucurbitaceae), including summer squash, winter squash, pumpkin, cucumber, or melons, for bacterial wilt





ROTATE CROPS


Crop rotation is a good way to avoid insect pests and fungal pathogens that can build up in the soil year after year.

Outdoors, in the ground, use your polyculture planting of herbs and flowers to fill all the places you grew your marijuana last season. Plant this year’s crop in different locations within the same bed. Avoid putting your plants in exactly the same locations for three years in a row. In the fourth year, you can plant them again in their original locations.

Consider one of these crop rotation schemes when planting outside:

• Make three different plots: A, B, and C. Plant your crop in A the first year, in B the second year, and in C the third year. In year four, you go back to plot A. Every year, put flowers and herbs in each plot where you do not grow marijuana.





In plot A: year one, plant marijuana; year two, plant herbs and flowers; year three, plant vegetables; year four, plant marijuana again.

In plot B: year one, plant herbs and flowers; year two, plant marijuana; year three, plant vegetables; year four, plant herbs and flowers again.

In plot C: year one, plant vegetables; year two, plant herbs and flowers; year three, plant marijuana; year four, plant vegetables again.

• Make a map of your plot and record the location of each plant every year. Change the location of your marijuana plants each year for three years. In year four, you can install the plants at their original locations.

• Randomize each plant’s location each year. This way, only a few plants will wind up in the same spot as last year’s plants, but most will be in new locations.



In containers, whether indoors or outdoors, start each growing cycle with fresh potting media. Never use potting soil for more than one crop of marijuana; reuse it for flowers and herbs instead. In addition, be sure to disinfect your pots between crops. Wash out the pots, and soak them in a 10-percent bleach solution (one part household bleach to nine parts water).

For hydroponics systems, you don’t need to rotate crops, but you do need to clean out your system thoroughly between crops.





PLANT MARIGOLDS


Marigolds (Tagetes species and hybrids), in addition to attracting beneficial insects, are particularly helpful in controlling root nematodes. French marigolds (T. patula) and African marigolds (T. erecta) are highly aromatic in all plant parts. The aromatic chemicals excreted from their roots repel root nematodes. These chemicals are most effective when you plant your marijuana plant in the same spot where marigolds were previously grown. See “Rotate Crops” on this page for rotation techniques. Planting marigolds next to your marijuana is less effective.





Marigolds excrete chemicals that repel nematodes. Grow marigolds in one location for one year. The next year, pull those marigolds and plant cannabis there instead.





CREATE HEALTHY SOIL


Biologically active soil is a critical component of natural plant communities and healthy plants. You can create it yourself by incorporating dead plant material, such as compost, manure, and mulch, into your growing media. This material is the foundation of the intricate food web found in a living soil ecosystem.

Dead plants are broken down by bacteria and fungi, many of which are active antagonists of pathogens. As plant matter breaks down, the process releases mineral nutrients that are taken up by your crop. The more organisms that thrive in your soil, the less room there is for invading pathogens such as soilborne pathogenic fungi and root-infecting nematodes.





Compost piles


Making compost is one of the best money-saving practices you can do. The primary ingredients of good, rich compost are items that we normally throw away: kitchen waste (without animal products) and yard trimmings (grass clippings, spent vegetable plants, shrub and tree trimmings). Add manure to this and you have “black gold.” Make sure that everything that goes into your compost pile is free of weed seeds, diseases, pests, and chemicals. Bacteria and fungi transform these ingredients into biologically active, nutrient-rich growing media.





This simplified illustration of the food soil web shows the complex interactions among the living organisms that derive sustenance from dead plant material and create healthy soil.

To make your own compost, make a pile of two parts dry brown material (dead leaves, straw, or chipped branches, for example) to one part fresh green material (grass clippings, kitchen waste, green leaves, and so on). When the pile looks like a good wheelbarrow load (about 1 cubic yard/0.03 cubic meters), spread about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of chicken manure and a few shovels full of good soil over the top of the pile. Continue building the pile as material is available, keeping the proportions at two-thirds brown and one-third green. Add more chicken manure and soil periodically. Keep the pile moist but not wet, and turn it over with a shovel once a week or so. Decomposition begins right away. The pile will generate heat, so pay attention that it doesn’t get too hot, because it can catch fire.

Many people like to use a three-bin system for composting. Build your original pile in the first bin, until the bin is full. As the material decomposes, the pile becomes smaller. When the volume has decreased by half, shovel the pile into bin number two. Start a new pile in bin one. When the volume of material in bin two has decreased by half, shovel the pile into bin three. Put the pile from bin one into bin two, and start a new pile in bin one again. When the volume of material in bin three is half as big, it is ready to use. This method gives you a constant supply of fresh compost for your marijuana production.





Collect yard waste, consisting of spent vegetable plants and shrub and tree trimmings, to start your composting efforts.





Collect yard waste in bin number one. When the volume has decreased by half, shovel the pile into bin number two. Start a new pile in bin one. When the volume of material in bin two has decreased by half, shovel the pile into bin three. Put the pile from bin one into bin two, and start a new pile in bin one again. When the volume of material in bin three is half as big, it is ready to use.





Raised beds and sheet mulching


If you are starting a brand-new outdoor patch, consider putting in raised beds and using sheet mulch instead of the common practice of turning over the soil. Digging up your soil and turning it over is back-breaking work, plus it destroys soil structure and disrupts the soil food web community. Disturbing the soil also encourages weed germination. Sheet mulching is effective at eliminating weeds and pests; it improves your soil, and it is much easier than all that digging. Here’s how to create and fill a raise bed.

1. Build a raised bed by bolting four pieces of wood together in a square or rectangular frame on the ground.

2. Put down a layer of flattened cardboard boxes in the bottom of your raised bed.

3. Add a 2- or 3-inch (5 or 7.5 cm) layer of manure on top of the cardboard, followed by 8 inches (20 cm) of compost.

4. Plant your seedlings directly into the compost and water them well.

5. Top it all off with a 3-inch (7.5 cm) layer of mulch.





These raised beds are ready to plant. Raised beds keep soil warm and make it easier to weed, water, and harvest.

Note that all these thicknesses depend on how high the sides of the bed are. Use these measurements as guidelines. The roots of your seedlings will grow through the wet cardboard and into the native soil below. Weeds will be unable to grow up through the cardboard, and, deprived of light, they will die. Beneficial worms, fungi, and bacteria will feed on the cardboard, releasing its nutrients (after all, cardboard is also dead plant material). By next planting season, the cardboard will be gone.





CREATE HEALTHY POTTING MEDIA


If you grow marijuana in containers, do not use outdoor garden soil as a planting media. Garden soil settles over time and becomes far too dense and airless in a pot to sustain healthy plant growth. It can also contain weed seeds and pathogens. Commercial organic potting soils are artificial growing media that contain no actual soil at all. Usually, they are composed of perlite and vermiculite, along with compost, peat moss, coconut coir, or bark fines. They also contain sharp sand to improve drainage. These artificial, soilless mixes were invented decades ago and are the standard media used for container-grown plants throughout the nursery industry today.

Using perlite in the mix is essential, because the volcanic byproduct provides little pockets of air in the container. Plant roots must have oxygen (air) or they die, so getting air into your containers is vital. The mix must also retain moisture, and that’s the point of including vermiculite. Adding sand improves the media’s drainage. The organic components (compost, peat moss, coconut coir, bark fines) help the mix retain nutrients as well as moisture. Artificial potting media is traditionally sterile, containing no beneficial fungi or bacteria. However, many manufacturers of organic potting soil now include beneficial mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria in their media. If you buy potting media, get this kind.

Or you can create your own organic potting media. As usual, wear a face mask to protect your lungs from dust while you mix this up.

1. Fill a wheelbarrow or large tub with one part of either coconut coir or bark fines.

2. Add one part perlite, one part organic compost, and one part good, biologically active soil.

3. Add a handful of dry organic fertilizer and a handful of dolomite lime (to balance the pH).

4. Lightly moisten all these ingredients, and then mix thoroughly with a shovel.

5. Load it into your containers. You can plant your seedlings or rooted cuttings right away.



This mix will not burn roots and will be loaded with beneficial bacteria, fungi, and other beneficial organisms that were in the biologically active soil component of the mix.





CHOOSE THE RIGHT CONTAINER


If you are growing marijuana in containers rather than in the ground, it is worth considering container sizes, shapes, and materials. Make these choices based on your circumstances, environment, climate, and budget.





Container size


Marijuana matures into a big plant and it needs a big container—5 to 15 gallons (19 to 57 liters)—to reach its full size. Marijuana grows fast, and mature plants have big root systems, but you don’t want to put small plants into big containers. You’ll get best results if you shift plants into bigger containers as they grow. In general, move a plant up to a container size only 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) bigger in diameter each time you up-pot. For example, move a plant that is fully established in a 4-inch-diameter (10 cm) pot up to a 6-inch (15 cm) pot (a 1-gallon/3.8 liter container). After the plant is fully established in the 1-gallon container, you can move it up to a 5-gallon (19 liter) container. Container size is important, because a small plant with a small root system is unable to absorb all the water in the large soil volume that’s in a large container. The result is the soil stays too wet for too long, thus increasing the probability that your small plant will get root rot or the roots will simply drown.

Alternatively, some growers put small plants into big containers because they don’t want the hassle of repeatedly moving plants into larger ones (up-potting). But this requires very careful watering. You have to be precise and wet only the soil immediately surrounding the small plant. By paying attention to detail and being careful, you avoid soaking the entire container with water and drowning your plant’s roots. If you’re careful and you do it right, your plant will grow large enough quickly enough that you can soon switch over to regular watering.





Up-potting


Plants in small containers will need watering more frequently than those in larger containers for two reasons. First, the water-holding capacity of a small volume of media is not very high. Larger volumes of media in bigger containers hold a lot more water than small volumes in small containers. Second, marijuana grows rapidly and has a big root system. Plants in small containers can easily become root bound and quickly suck up all the water you give them. If your plants wilt soon after they’ve been watered, they’re probably root bound; time to up-pot to larger containers.





Container shape


Never put your plants into a container with a narrow neck. If the opening at the top of the container is smaller than the body of the container, you’ll have a very difficult time getting your plant out of the container without seriously damaging your plant or breaking the container. Choose containers with straight sides or with wider mouths.





Container material


Plastic containers are inexpensive, widely available, and produce good results. Most growers use the thin-walled black plastic containers common in the nursery industry. But almost anything can be used as a container for growing plants as long as it has a drainage hole (or holes) in the bottom. Many growers use grow bags. These large bags of heavy-duty plastic, usually black, are very cheap and easy to use. Other people cut a hole in the top of a large bag of potting soil, punch a drainage hole in the bottom, and plug their marijuana plants directly into the hole in the top.

Unglazed terra-cotta pots and wooden planters are said to breathe, meaning that water evaporates through the walls of the pot and your plants dry out faster. If you live in a wet climate, you might choose this option so that your potting media does not stay too wet for too long. However, if you live in a dry climate, you will find that you’ll need to water more often.

Plastic, metal, glass, and glazed ceramic containers do not breathe and your plants stay moist longer. These materials are better choices if you live in a dry climate. The planting media inside thin-walled black plastic and metal containers gets very hot in full sun—hot enough to cook and kill the roots of your plants. So if you are growing outdoors in full sun, use white containers to avoid the problem, or thicker walled containers (wood, ceramic, fiber, polyurethane foam), which have insulating properties that help keep the soil cool.

Smart pots are made of durable fabric that breathes. Air pots are made from plastic perforated by numerous holes on the sides and bottom. Both of these containers allow marijuana plants to grow faster than they do in regular containers because their roots get plenty of access to oxygen. Excess oxygen actually prunes the root tips by killing the growing tips, so another benefit of these containers is that the plants do not get root bound. These kinds of containers also drain rapidly, avoiding issues associated with overwatering. Keep in mind that you must water twice as often as you would water plants in containers with just one drainage hole.

A hempy bucket gives you some of the benefits of hydroponic techniques. It is a black plastic bucket with no drainage hole in the bottom. Instead, it has one hole in the side of the bucket, 2 inches (5 cm) from the bottom. To use, fill the bucket with a mix of three parts perlite to one part vermiculite and then plant a marijuana plant in this fast-draining mix. This container provides a reservoir of nutrients and water in the 2-inch space at the bottom, below the drainage hole, which means that you do not have to water or fertilize as often. The drawback of this container is that the growing media has no biologically active components (see “Create Healthy Soil,” this page).





USE A HYDROPONIC SYSTEM


Hydroponic systems may appeal to the more technically minded grower with a scientific bent, because they require attention to detail that is not needed when growing in the more forgiving soil or potting media environments. Hydroponic systems completely eliminate soilborne diseases and pests, so you never have to worry about root rot, root maggots, or similar issues. However, you will need to monitor and repair equipment (pumps, aerators, fertilizer injectors, tubing, and containers) and test pH and water quality every day. If you’re a DIY person with a technical bent, this may work best for you. Turn to the “Recommended Reading” section in the back of this book (this page) for sources of good information on how to cultivate marijuana in a hydroponic system.





CHAPTER ELEVEN


MANAGE NUTRIENTS




Plants make their own food from gathering sunlight and converting it to chemical energy (photosynthesis). When we provide them with mineral nutrients from biologically active soil and fertilizer, we are supplying the mineral elements plants need to metabolize and use the food they make. This allows them to grow, mature, and flower.





MEASURE AND MODIFY PH


The pH scale measures acidity and alkalinity, and knowing your growing media’s pH is important. Your first step in making sure your plants get the right nutrients is to be sure your growing media is the proper pH. If the pH is too low (acid), the essential plant nutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), and molybdenum (Mo) are less available to your plants. These mineral elements (see this page) may be present in the growing media, but your plant is unable to absorb them if the media is too acid. Conversely, if the pH is too high (alkaline), your plant will suffer from deficiencies of boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn). These elements (see this page) become less available to plants at higher pH levels.

The pH scale ranges from 0 (extremely acid, such as battery acid) to 7 (neutral, such as pure distilled water) to 14 (extremely alkaline, such as lye). For marijuana, the best pH for vigorous healthy growth in soil or potting media is 6.5, but a range from 6.5 to 7 is acceptable. In hydroponic growing systems, the best pH range is 5.8 to 6.5. All essential nutrients are available to your marijuana plants when the pH falls within these ranges.

Measure the pH of your growing media and keep it in the proper range for best growth. The best way to measure pH at home is by using an electronic pH meter, a relatively inexpensive, reliable, durable, and accurate tool. Alternatively, you can send soil samples to a laboratory for analysis (see this page). Lab tests are more expensive, but they are the most accurate. In addition, a number of very inexpensive home test kits are available at many garden centers. These come with capsules of reagents that you add to water from your growing media. The reagents cause a color reaction that turns your sample a particular color; you compare that with the color chart provided with the kit to determine the pH. Other home test kits use a similar technique that indicates the pH with color changes on litmus paper. Home kits give you good ballpark estimates of pH but are not nearly as accurate or efficient as an electronic pH meter or lab test.

If your growing media is too acid, you can add dolomitic lime (dolomite) to raise the pH. If it is too alkaline, you can add sulfur to lower the pH. The amount of dolomite or sulfur you add will depend on the acidity or alkalinity of your growing media. Follow instructions on the packaging, and keep testing to measure the pH until you achieve the proper range.





MANAGE ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS


There are seventeen nutrients required for all plant growth, including marijuana. Three of these—oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen—are available in our atmosphere. Two of these—chlorine and silicon—are generally available in the water supply and in fertilizers even if they are not listed on the package.

The remaining twelve mineral nutrients must be provided by the grower and are essential for healthy marijuana growth. They’re considered essential because a plant cannot manufacture them, and without them a plant will die. Plants must obtain these essential mineral nutrients from the growing media, or from fertilizers you apply to the soil, potting media, or hydroponic solution. Too little (deficiency) or too much (toxicity) of any one of these twelve elements can cause symptoms to appear on your plants and result in poor growth, or even death. In addition, your growing media must fall within a certain pH range in order for the marijuana to absorb the nutrients.





Primary macronutrients


Three mineral nutrients are considered primary macronutrients because all plants need them in relatively large quantities. These three are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Every bag, bottle, or can of fertilizer sold in the United States is required to have three numbers on the label: the first number tells you the percentage of nitrogen in the fertilizer, the second number gives you the percentage of phosphorus, and the third is the percentage of potassium. A label with numbers such as 35-9-18 tells you that this fertilizer contains 35 percent nitrogen, 9 percent phosphorus, and 18 percent potassium. (This particular fertilizer, by the way, might be good for lawns, but not for marijuana. It has way too much nitrogen.)

During the vegetative stage, the phase of plant growth before it begins to flower, marijuana needs 6 or 7 percent nitrogen, 4 to 9 percent phosphorus, and 4 or 5 percent potassium (7-4-4, for example). During the flowering phase, the plant needs lower nitrogen, at 2 or 3 percent; high phosphorus, at 8 to 12 percent; and 4 to 6 percent potassium (2-8-4, for example).





Secondary macronutrients


Marijuana plants also need calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S) in fairly large quantities, but not as large as the quantities of N, P, and K. These secondary nutrient quantities are measured in parts per million (PPM). See the chart of nutrition guidelines on this page for recommendations for marijuana. Many popular and widely available organic fertilizers created specifically for marijuana provide a complete list of all the essential nutrients on the packaging. Other fertilizers may not tell you how much Ca, S, or Mg the product contains. Always be sure to read labels, and search for the appropriate organic fertilizer.





Micronutrients


Six elements are considered micronutrients because they are needed in microscopic quantities: boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), and zinc (Zn). These micronutrient quantities are measured in parts per million (PPM). See the chart of nutrition guidelines on this page for recommendations for marijuana. All of them are absolutely vital for healthy plant growth and reproduction. Use a good organic fertilizer that lists micronutrients on the package.





Decrease nitrogen


It is important that you get the right balance of nutrients, because overfertilization with nitrogen, in particular, can cause just as many problems as underfertilization. The symptoms of too much nitrogen are leaves are overly large, soft, and dark green; stems are too soft and weak to stand; flowers are small; and roots grow slowly. If you suspect your plants are suffering from too much nitrogen, stop fertilizing your plants and flush the soil with water to remove some of the excess nitrogen. Once your plants are growing normally again—that is, when the symptoms are gone—you can resume fertilizing. Make sure the percentage of nitrogen in your fertilizer is no higher than 7 percent during the vegetative phase and about half that (3 percent) during flowering. The first number on the fertilizer package lists the percent of nitrogen.





Choose the right fertilizer


Look for fertilizers that have been certified organic by the National Organic Program (NOP) of the USDA or by Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI). Many excellent organic fertilizers, in both dry and liquid forms, are available for marijuana cultivation today. Look for them online, at a garden center, or at your marijuana growers’ supply house.

Use dry organic fertilizers to feed the soil in your outdoor plots to create and maintain biologically active soil. These fertilizers are less prone than chemical products to release excess nitrogen and/or phosphorus, both of which predispose your plants to attack by bacteria, fungi, and insect pests. They also maintain a balanced nutrient bank in the soil that promotes healthy plant growth and avoids nutrient deficiency and toxicity. Often, the major ingredients in dry organic fertilizers are created from dead plant material such as cottonseed meal, kelp meal, soy meal, and so forth. Beneficial bacteria and fungi in healthy growing media break down dry organic fertilizers and release nutrients for plant uptake.

Use liquid organic fertilizers for plants in containers or for hydroponic production systems. These fertilizers can be used for plants in the ground, but they are much more expensive than dry organics. Sources of nutrients contained in liquid fertilizers include fish emulsion and seaweed extracts, which are available for plant uptake more rapidly than nutrients in dry fertilizers. A number of companies make excellent liquid organic fertilizers, but be sure to read the label to confirm the ingredients. Look for the OMRI or NOP certification on the label.





NUTRITION GUIDELINES





Avoid processed, nonorganic, water-soluble fertilizers. These are cheap and readily available, which makes them tempting. However, processed fertilizers do not feed the beneficial micro-organisms in the soil ecosystem, and you run the risk of starving them out, thereby depleting your soil or potting media and losing the benefits of healthy biological activity. You also run the risk of burning roots if you use highly concentrated processed fertilizers, especially for potted plants. In addition, processed fertilizers can result in runoff nitrogen and phosphorus pollution of waterways and groundwater, which is a problem for everyone.





Stop fertilizing and flush salts


With fertilizer, more is not always better. Mineral salts build up in the soil over time if plants receive too much fertilizer, which causes plants to wilt and turn brown. If pests and diseases are absent, and if your plant has wilted from overfertilizing, it can recover. The key is to catch the problem early enough and act quickly. Left unchecked, an overfertilized plant will die. To wash away the salts and flush excess fertilizer, flood the soil or potting media with clean water. Stop fertilizing your plants. When the symptoms are gone, you can resume fertilizing, providing the correct amount of nutrients.





QUANTITIES OF MACRONUTRIENTS IN ORGANIC SOURCE MATERIAL





SUPPLEMENT CARBON DIOXIDE (INDOORS ONLY)


Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for healthy marijuana, as it is for all plants. It is not a mineral nutrient, but a gas in the air that is absorbed by plant leaves. Plants use CO2 to make sugars (carbohydrates) by harvesting solar energy from the sun (or artificial lights) and converting it (the light) to chemical energy (carbohydrates) through photosynthesis. The plant burns carbohydrates to grow and manufacture THC and CBD.

Today, the amount of CO2 in Earth’s atmosphere is at 0.04 percent and is slowly rising. If you can increase the amount of CO2 available to your plants, you can stimulate growth. You can’t do this outdoors, because the gas will simply dissipate—and this wastes money and contributes to global climate change. However, you can increase the CO2 levels in your grow room or greenhouse, and this is especially important if you are growing in a closed environment. Without airflow from the outside, your crop will quickly suck up all the available CO2 in the air and stop growing, even though it’s getting plenty of light, water, and mineral nutrients. In that case, you will need to install vents to bring in outside air or supplement with CO2 gas. Equipment that includes a CO2 tank, pressure gauge, and monitor is the most efficient way to supplement with CO2.

WARNING

High levels of CO2 are lethal to people and pets. If you are growing indoors, carefully monitor the CO2 levels. Monitoring equipment is available from vendors that sell the supplementation equipment.



The amount of CO2 used by your plants depends on the amount of light and/or water available. Do not supplement with CO2 if you grow in low light, because the plants do not photosynthesize much and the costly CO2 is wasted. You will also waste CO2 if your plants lack sufficient water, in which case plants close their stomata (the pores on leaves that open and close to exchange gases) and are unable to take up the CO2.





CHAPTER TWELVE


MANAGE LIGHT




Three aspects of light must be considered for marijuana production: light duration, quality, and quantity. The easiest aspect for any grower to control is duration.





MANAGE LIGHT DURATION


For optimum vegetative growth, the following hours of light are required per twenty-four-hour period:

• For sativa–dominant strains, thirteen to eighteen hours

• For indica–dominant strains, fourteen to eighteen hours



To induce flowering, the following hours of light are required per twenty-four-hour period:

• For sativa–dominant strains, twelve hours or less

• For indica–dominant strains, eleven hours or less



Indoor growers induce flowering by turning the lights on and off to control the number of hours of light per twenty-four-hour period. Outdoors, plants will naturally flower only during the short days of autumn. To induce flowering at other times of the year, outdoor growers need to place a lightproof cover over their patch or greenhouse for a few hours a day. This cover must be removed and then replaced every day.

By manipulating the hours of light, you can bring your plants into flower any time you want. You can also reverse flowering and put your plants back into vegetative mode by increasing the light duration. This is a handy trick when you want to remove male seedlings (see chapter sixteen, “Use Proper Propagation Techniques,” this page).





Increase hours of light


If your indoor plants are not growing as fast as you’d like, try giving them more hours of light. Some growers give their plants twenty-four hours of continuous light, but marijuana will grow quite vigorously with eighteen hours of light. Also, if your plants have begun to flower too soon, increase the hours of light to a minimum of fourteen hours per day; the plants will stop flowering and start growing again.





Decrease hours of light


If your plants are mature but have failed to flower, you can force them to flower by giving them short days and long nights. Give your plants ten to twelve hours of light and twelve to fourteen hours of uninterrupted darkness to initiate flowering.





MANAGE LIGHT QUALITY


Light quality is measured in wavelength (nanometers, or nm). Marijuana needs blue and red wavelengths of light (475 to 700 nm).

Light sources emit light at many different wavelengths, and visible light—that is, the light that the human eye can see—corresponds to specific colors in the light spectrum. Light with a wavelength of about 400 nm is perceived by humans as violet, blue light is about 475 nm, and red light is about 650 nm. The entire spectral range from violet through red (400 to 700 nm) is known as the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) zone.

Lightbulbs for indoor growers are available in a bewildering array of choices, including fluorescent; incandescent; high-intensity discharge (HID), which includes high-pressure sodium (HPS) and other metal halides; and light-emitting diode (LED) lights. Of these, incandescent bulbs are poor choices, because they produce too much heat and not enough red and blue light. Daylight fluorescents (and grow lights) create the appropriate light spectrum and do not get too hot, but the quantity of light emitted is rather low (they work well for seedlings). HPS lamps generate the right quantity and quality of light for excellent growth, but they produce a lot of heat. LED lamps are relatively new and extremely promising, because they generate the right quantity and quality of light and produce very little heat.

The best source of light, the sun, provides the perfect light quality for marijuana, with just the right wavelengths. Outdoor growers can rely on the sun for their light source.





MANAGE LIGHT QUANTITY


Light quantity, or intensity, is measured in various ways: foot-candles, lux (lumens per square meter), or watts per square meter. Marijuana will grow well and rapidly from 25,000 to 50,000 lux. The sun delivers to Earth approximately 100,000 lux at its maximum intensity, but this varies by the season of the year, the weather (clouds, haze), or even the air quality (smog).

Indoor growers need to pay attention to these measurements when acquiring lightbulbs. A 600-watt bulb is the most cost-effective and produces a sufficient quantity of light for good marijuana growth. The premium choices are HPS or LED bulbs.

According to the inverse square law, the light quantity (intensity) produced by a light source decreases as the square of the distance from the source. Thus, if your plant is 2 feet (0.6 m) away from a light source, it’s getting a quarter of the light intensity (22 = 4). If the light source is 3 feet (1 m) above your plant, your plant is getting only a ninth of the light intensity (32 = 9), and at 4 feet (1.2 m) it’s getting one-sixteenth of the intensity (42 = 16). Obviously, the closer the lights are to your plants, the better. Equally obvious, your plants are going to burn if the bulb is too hot and too close. The best solution is to choose bulbs that produce an adequate quantity of light in the proper wavelengths, but that generate as little heat as possible. Also, if your plants are tall, the lowermost leaves will not receive enough light. To resolve this issue, hang multiple bulbs low enough to illuminate all sides of your plants as well as the tops.

The major advantage of outdoor cultivation is that the light produced by the sun is ideal. The sun costs you nothing, the quantity of light is perfect, it is full power (maximum lux), and it is full spectrum (perfect PAR).





Multiple bulbs that illuminate all sides of your plants increase productivity.





CHAPTER THIRTEEN


MANAGE WATER




Water delivers mineral nutrients to your plants from the growing media. It also delivers all the fuel (the carbohydrates created by photosynthesis in the leaves) to other plant parts. Water moves through the plant via a system of vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) much like the veins and arteries of your body. Roots absorb water, which is transported upward as water vapor is expelled through the stomata in the leaves via transpiration.





MANAGE WATER QUANTITY AND FREQUENCY


How much water you should give your plants, and how often they need to be watered, depends entirely on the growing conditions. In general, you should water your plant if the top of the growing media is dry down to ½ inch (13 mm) or so. Measure the depth of dry media by sticking the tip of your finger into it ( ½ inch is about half the distance from your fingertip to your first knuckle). Your finger can detect cool moisture if water is present. For a more precise indicator, use an inexpensive electronic moisture meter.

Don’t set up a rigid watering schedule for your plants. Instead, pay attention to your plants to see what they need. Just because it’s Tuesday and Tuesday is watering day doesn’t mean your plants actually need water. On the other hand, an outdoor plant can lose water so fast on a windy, sunny, hot day that the leaves scorch and burn, quickly dying back from the tips and edges. Indoor plants also suffer on really hot afternoons. Monitor your plants and water only when necessary, not according to an arbitrary schedule.





Avoid overwatering


Overwatering is the number-one killer of any plant in a container, whether indoors or out. To avoid overwatering your potted plants, add only 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water whenever the soil or potting media is dry to a depth of ½ inch (13 mm). Never water so much that the soil or potting media stays saturated with water for more than an hour or so. If the soil is too wet for too long, the water drives out the air in the planting media and plant roots rot and die. Waterlogged soil is anaerobic (deprived of oxygen), and roots must have oxygen or they die. Roots don’t die in hydroponic systems because they are soilless (plants grow in inert media) and because the roots are well oxygenated.

To enable the water to drain properly, do not place saucers under pots. The planting media in pots that sit in a saucer full of water stay too wet for too long. The roots will suffocate and the plant will die. Instead, add spacers or props between the pot and saucer, or use tray or saucer types that are ridged to keep the pot suspended above the tray.





Prop containers up and away from standing water.

For more information on overwatering in regards to specific types of containers, see the section on container materials (this page).





KEEP FOLIAGE DRY


Most fungal spores and all plant pathogenic bacteria require a film of water on the surface of the foliage to infect your cannabis plants. When you water your plants, water only the soil or potting media and keep the foliage dry. Don’t use a sprinkler or any other overhead watering method. Instead, rely on furrow irrigation, drip trickle systems, or even the old-fashioned watering can where you can easily place the water exactly where you want it.





MEASURE AND ADJUST WATER QUALITY


Except for distilled water, all water has dissolved minerals in it. These minerals are called dissolved solids or dissolved salts. The total amount of these dissolved minerals is called total dissolved solids (TDS). The water you provide to your plants may be soft, hard, or saline, and most municipal water is treated with chlorine and fluoride. If you have a soft-water treatment system, your water may have elevated levels of sodium. Well water or water from an underground aquifer is frequently hard, with a high mineral content, including dissolved solids of calcium and iron. In coastal areas, saltwater intrusion from the ocean can be problematic. All of these factors influence the ability of water to provide the appropriate conditions for healthy plant growth.

You can test your water quality by measuring its electrical conductivity (EC) using an electrical conductivity meter. The EC meter passes an electrical current between two electrodes. The number that appears on the meter tells you the parts per million (PPM) of TDS in the water. The meter will have instructions on how to convert the EC reading to PPM if the meter does not do it automatically. The higher the number, the more dissolved solids are in the water.

Pure water, such as distilled water, has an EC of zero—it does not conduct electricity. Hard water, such as well water that contains a lot of calcium and/or magnesium, is a good conductor of electricity and has a high reading. The EC meter tells you how much TDS is in your water, but it does not tell you exactly which minerals it contains.

The closer the reading is to zero, the better, because all fertilizers add dissolved solids to the water in the growing media. Marijuana grows best when the total dissolved solids are in the range of 800 to 1200 PPM. If your water supply starts at 800 PPM and you add enough fertilizer to make a 1200 PPM solution, the total PPM will be 2000, and that’s too high. You run the risk of damage or even death of your plants when TDS (or PPM) is too high.





Improve water quality


If your water supply has a lot of TDS in it, you can improve it. If you’re a small grower with only a few plants, water them with distilled water. Most supermarkets carry distilled water and it’s not too expensive. If you’re a large commercial grower with a lot of plants, invest in a reverse osmosis system to purify your water, remove harmful elements, and bring the EC back down to near zero.

Measuring TDS is especially helpful in managing hydroponic systems. As your plants grow, they remove nutrients from the water, lowering TDS and changing the composition of the nutrient solution. The EC test reveals when the nutrients have been depleted from the solution, so that you can replenish or replace them and keep your plants thriving.





CHAPTER FOURTEEN


MANAGE TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY




Marijuana has a complex genetic background and thrives in a wide range of temperatures and humidity levels.





MANAGE TEMPERATURE


In general, marijuana prefers warm daytime temperatures in the 70°F to 85°F (21°C to 29°C) range during vegetative growth. When the plants start to flower and make buds, they prefer cooler daytime temperatures, from 65°F to 80°F (18°C to 27°C). At night, temperatures should range from 60°F to 75°F (16°C to 24°C) during vegetative growth, and 55°F to 70°F (13°C to 21°C) during flowering. Strains with a high percentage of indica genes in their backgrounds will do well at the cool end of the temperature range. Conversely, strains with a high percentage of sativa genes in the background are naturally adapted to warmer, more tropical temperatures.

The nighttime temperature drop is important for the plant’s respiration and metabolism—how it burns the carbohydrate fuel it manufactures during the daytime through photosynthesis. In the dark, of course, the plant does not undergo photosynthesis, so it has to consume its fuel reserves in order to live, grow, and manufacture the products you want. As the temperature goes up, respiration speeds up. At high temperatures in the dark, the plant is burning way too much fuel trying to stay alive and can literally starve to death.





MANAGE HUMIDITY


Humidity, the amount of water vapor in the air, is a very important aspect of growing marijuana. The capacity of air to hold water vapor is temperature related: warm air holds more water than cool air. Marijuana grows best in the range of 40 to 80 percent humidity for vegetative growth. When your plants begin to flower, they prefer a humidity of 40 to 60 percent.

Lower humidity is especially important for indica and its hybrids, but less important for sativa, because it is naturally adapted to tropical (warm and humid) environments.

High humidity is called for when you are initiating root development from cuttings. When you take a cutting from a mother plant, you have severed the cutting from the mother plant’s root system. Because your cutting has no roots, it needs high humidity to avoid losing too much water through its leaves; if this happens, it will desiccate (dry up) and die (see chapter sixteen, “Use Proper Propagation Techniques,” this page).

In low humidity, spider mites and powdery mildew can be problematic. In high humidity, gray mold (Botrytis cinerea) can develop and quickly destroy your crop, and this is why it is important that you move potted plants indoors when the weather turns rainy during autumn flowering time to avoid problems with gray mold in your buds. In addition, if humidity reaches 100 percent, the air is saturated with water vapor and transpiration can no longer function; in short, it shuts down the plant’s ability to move water and nutrients through its body.

To measure humidity, use a hygrometer. Indoor growers can manage humidity quite well using a humidifier to raise the humidity and a dehumidifier to lower it. Outdoor growers do not have much control over humidity, but they can cover all types of plants to protect them from autumn rain during flowering to help avoid mold problems. Cover plants by building a roofed structure over them or by constructing a solid frame on which you spread translucent plastic.





CHAPTER FIFTEEN


USE PROPER PRUNING TECHNIQUES




Marijuana needs the same pruning techniques required by any other plant. When you remove a side branch, a leaf, or a bud, make a clean cut with a sharp, sterilized tool at the base of the branch, leaf, or bud where it joins a stem. Avoid making ragged cuts with dull tools, and avoid leaving behind stubs. Ragged cuts and stubs fail to heal and are prone to disease.

Every time you cut plants, you must use clean, sterilized tools. You don’t have to sterilize tools between cuts on the same plant, but you definitely need to sterilize each tool when you finish working on one plant before you make cuts on a different plant.

Many diseases (viruses, bacteria, phytoplasmas, and certain fungi) are easily transmitted from infected plants to healthy plants by any tool used to cut, prune, or otherwise wound a plant. Dirty tools are the horticultural equivalent to dirty needles in the transmission of serious diseases. See the section, “Sanitize,” this page, to learn how to sterilize your tools. This problem is especially pernicious when the infected plant is symptomless.

In addition to sterilizing your tools, you also need to wash your hands frequently, and keep all your equipment and your work area clean. Every time you prune a plant, you leave open wounds that may be susceptible to infection, so keep your plant clean and keep it healthy. In general, avoid pruning healthy leaves. The leaf is the powerhouse that produces the energy the plant needs to manufacture the medicinal and/or psychoactive compounds you want.





WHY AND WHEN TO PRUNE


There are four reasons to prune your plants:

• To make them more compact to conserve space or hide them from prying eyes

• To remove lower limbs that are too shaded

• To direct the plant’s energy to selected flower buds to make them grow bigger

• To make cuttings and clone your superior female plants



Prune to make your plants more compact. Prune off the terminal vegetative bud—that is, remove the tip of the main stem—to make your plants fuller and bushier. This is helpful in managing sativas that can sometimes grow to 15 feet (4.6 m) tall or more, so that you can avoid having to climb a ladder to work on your plants. The terminal vegetative bud (the growing point at the tip of the main stem) produces a hormone (growth regulator) called auxin that flows down through the veins of the stem and suppresses the development of side branches. Removing the terminal bud removes the source of the auxin so that side branches can grow bigger and stronger. The side branches will also grow into a new multiple headed crown for the plant. You may also want to remove the terminal bud from each branch of the new crown. The new crown will respond by producing more side branches that will grow bigger and stronger. The plant grows wider and bushier, but it won’t grow as tall as it would if you had not pruned.

Prune to remove lower limbs that are growing in shade. In greenhouses or grow rooms under artificial light, where space is at a premium, lower branches are shaded by the top growth above them. Leaves on branches that get too little light cannot make enough food to support themselves. They are weak, and they stay alive by taking food from the rest of the plant. Prune these branches as close as possible to the main stem. Do not leave stubs that can become infected.





A: To remove the terminal bud at the top of your plant, decide how tall you want your plant to be and cut the stem ¼ inch (6 mm) above the nearest leaf at that height. Cut just above where the leaf attaches to the stem (in other words, above its axil).

B: Slant the cut at a 45-degree angle away from the leaf.

C: Buds in the axils of all the leaves below the cut will grow into new stems.

Prune to create big buds. If you want to grow giant flower buds to impress your friends, prune off the terminal vegetative bud at the top of the plant. Then cut off all side shoots except the four biggest and strongest in the top third of the plant. The four remaining shoots will grow into a strong new crown. This crown will pump all its energy into a small number of huge flower buds. To increase bud size, bend the shoots and tie them to a support so that they are horizontal.

Note that pruning to create big flower buds does not give you more ounces of flower buds per plant. Whether you get a whole lot of small flower buds or very few giant buds, the number of ounces of buds stays the same. A marijuana plant, or any other plant for that matter, has a finite amount of net photosynthetic product (sugar) to devote to flower bud production. The total weight of the flower buds a plant produces depends solely on how much light, CO2, water, and mineral nutrients it gets at the appropriate temperatures. You can manipulate your marijuana plant to produce a small crop of large buds by pruning off side shoots. Conversely, you can encourage a large crop of small buds by not pruning. The total weight of the buds will be the same as long as all other growing conditions are the same.

Prune to take cuttings and clone selected female plants. Prune away strong, healthy side shoots as close as possible to the main stem of your mother plant. See chapter sixteen, “Use Proper Propagation Techniques,” this page, for a complete description of how to initiate roots on cuttings.





CHAPTER SIXTEEN


USE PROPER PROPAGATION TECHNIQUES




Propagation is the art and science of creating new plants from seed, by cuttings, or by tissue culture. These three propagation techniques result in two fundamentally different outcomes. The first, growing from seed, produces unique new individual plants, because all seeds result from sexual reproduction. The other two propagation techniques are asexual methods that produce identical clones of the mother plant.





PROPAGATING FROM SEEDS


Be aware that when you purchase seeds (even the very expensive ones from a “famous” strain), each seedling will be a unique individual and will not be identical to its famous parent. For example, if you buy and propagate seeds of ‘Blue Dream’, each of your seedlings will be subtly different in aroma and taste, and in psychoactive and medicinal properties. Each seedling is an offspring, not a copy. That seedlings are different is a good thing, because each seedling is a variation, and this genetic diversity has been the source of new strains in breeding programs that continue to improve the quality of cannabis. Also, be aware that some diseases can be carried in marijuana seeds, so make sure your source provides clean, disease-free seed.





To propagate from seeds:


1. Soak seeds in clean, room-temperature water overnight (12 to 14 hours) prior to planting to enhance germination.

2. Plant each seed about ¼ inch (6 mm) deep in clean potting mix in a small but deep, clean container, about 6 inches (15 cm) tall and 4 inches (10 cm) wide. Marijuana seedlings produce a taproot that grows very deep very quickly, so make sure your little pots are deep enough. The red plastic drink cups sold at most supermarkets do a good job, but be sure to cut a drainage hole in the bottom of the cup.



3. Mist the growing media as needed to keep the seeds moist, but not soaking wet. If the media and seeds dry out completely, they will die. On the other hand, if they are drowning in water, they will suffer badly.

4. Keep the seeds at temperatures between 75°F and 85°F (24°C to 29°C).

5. Put the little pots under fluorescent lights.

6. Watch for the seed to crack open. The primary root will emerge about five days after planting, though it can sometimes take as long as two weeks. The little seedling will stand up straight with its two green cotyledons (seed leaves) spread wide to catch the light. After a few days, the seedling will begin to develop its first set of true leaves.





A female flower (top row) has two long, white styles that look like a tiny, old-style rabbit-ear TV antenna. Styles are the part of the female flower that receives pollen from the male flower. The pollen germinates, grows down into the ovary, and delivers a sperm cell to the egg cell inside the ovary. A male flower (bottom row) has golden pouches (anthers) that dangle from the flower and release pollen on the wind. Wind carries the pollen to the styles of the female flower.



When the roots of your seedling begin to grow out of the drainage holes in the bottom of the container, and your little plant has a couple sets of true leaves, it’s time to repot it in a larger container; 1-gallon (4 liter) pots work well at this point.

After propagating plants from seed, you need to determine the sex of your plants. Generally speaking, each marijuana seedling has a 50/50 chance of being male or female. You want to grow only female plants, because female flowers produce far more cannabinoids (THC and CBD) than male flowers. Discard male plants because their pollen will fertilize the flowers of the females, and if the females start to make seeds, they put all their energy into seed production and stop flowering. When they stop flowering, you get no more buds. Most growers do not want their female plants to make seeds.

You have to wait until the plant begins to flower to tell what sex it is. Once you learn what to look for, the differences between the flowers of male and female plants are obvious.

Here’s how to identify male plants while they are seedlings. As you grow your young plants under artificial light, keep the number of hours of light below twelve per day, and provide twelve to fourteen hours of uninterrupted darkness. Under this short-day regime, even very young plants will begin to flower. Then you can separate out all the males, keeping only the females.

Give your selected females fourteen to twenty-four hours of light per day to stop flowering. They will revert to vegetative mode and grow into big, strong, healthy females. You can plant them outdoors or keep them inside—just be sure they’re getting long days. If any of them have accidentally been pollinated and start to make seeds, simply cut off the developing seeds. When they are mature enough to produce a good crop of buds, put them on short days to induce flowering.





PROPAGATING FROM CUTTINGS


One form of asexual propagation of marijuana, cloning, involves pruning side-shoot cuttings and initiating root formation on those cuttings. Unlike seedlings, rooted cuttings are identical to the mother plant. When you take cuttings, choose a mother plant that is clean, healthy, and free of pests and disease. Make sure that all your tools (razor blades, scissors, knives, and so on) are sterile. See the section “Sanitize,” this page, for instructions on how to sterilize your tools.





To make and prepare cuttings:


1. Cut strong, robust side branches from your mother plant by severing their stems as close as possible to the main stem of the plant. Each side branch is a cutting that can be rooted and grown into a new plant. Remove all leaves from the cutting, except for a tuft of foliage at the tip. Remove the leaves quickly so that your cutting does not desiccate due to water loss through the leaves.

3. Trim off the base of the cutting’s stem just below a node, the place where leaves attach to the stem. New roots will eventually emerge at the node.

3. Dip the bottom end of the cutting into a rooting hormone preparation, either homemade or commercially prepared (see the accompanying sidebars).

4. Insert the end of the cutting into a peat pellet, rockwool, or a container of clean potting media.

5. Put your planted cuttings, including peat pellets or rockwool, inside a clear plastic container with a lid that will maintain high humidity until the cuttings have rooted. Lift the lid every day to let in air and wipe off excess moisture. If you are rooting cuttings in containers of potting media, put a glass jar or a plastic bag over each cutting to maintain high humidity. Open it up every day to let in air and shed excess water.



MAKE A HOMEMADE ORGANIC ROOTING PREPARATION

You’ll use twigs from willow trees steeped in water to create this preparation. Willow trees contain organic rooting compounds that can be extracted in water to use as a rooting solution for your marijuana cuttings.

1. Cut several 6-inch-long (15 cm) tips of willow branches from a tree and strip off the leaves.

2. Cut the twigs into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces.

3. Put a handful of twigs into 2 cups (0.5 liter) of water.

4. Let the mixture steep for three days.





Here’s a quicker method:


Follow steps 1 and 2, above. Then,

3. Add the 1-inch (2.5 cm) twigs to 2 cups (0.5 liter) of boiling water.

4. When the water cools, it’s ready to use (though it will get stronger after steeping for three days).





When the cuttings are well rooted, transplant them to larger containers of potting media. After up-potting, keep the rooted cuttings in high humidity by covering them in plastic bags for three or four days until the roots have time to acclimate to their new environment. Cuttings are delicate and can be in danger of desiccation and death from transplant shock, so don’t let them dry out.

Remember that your clones will only be as clean as the mother plant, so make sure your mother plant is free of pests and diseases before you make cuttings.

USE A COMMERCIAL ROOTING COMPOUND

Commercial rooting compounds are sold in powder, liquid, or gel form. They contain rooting hormones—indole acetic acid (IAA) and/or indole butyric acid (IBA)—both of which work very well. Find them online or at a horticultural supply store. (Note that these synthetic commercial rooting hormones are not organic materials.)





PROPAGATING BY TISSUE CULTURE


This method of asexual propagation offers an advantage: thousands of identical clones can be generated from a tiny snippet of a mother plant. With cuttings, one cutting gives you one plant. With tissue culture, one cutting can give you ten thousand identical plants. In addition, tissue culture is a tried-and-true method of getting rid of viruses and other pathogens in a valuable plant.

Tissue culture is a laboratory procedure carried out in test tubes and flasks under sterile conditions. Although the environment should be as clean as the operating theater in a hospital, it is possible for you to perform the entire procedure at home in your kitchen using homemade equipment and a pressure cooker (we recommend Plants from Test Tubes by Lydiane Kyte and John Kleyn for more information). Many orchid growers have been making plant clones at home for decades.

Thanks to our editor at Ten Speed Press, Lisa Regul: your professionalism, insights, and expertise are amazing. Our author colleagues and other sharp-eyed readers continue to give selflessly of their editorial skills and support. Thank you, Rebecca Cantrell, Ben Haggard, Judith Heath, Pam Hicks, and Carol Graves. We are exceedingly grateful to our family: Ruth Murphy, Sarah Wadsworth, Lauren Wadsworth, Ana Marguerite Deardorff, Eleanor Hutterer, Mary Halleman, Kelly Brown, Meg E. Deardorff, Randy Deardorff, Barb Smith, Jeanne Deardorff, Daniel Deardorff, and Judith-Kate Friedman. Yes, we know it’s big! Thank you to our friends and neighbors who support and cheer us along the way: Fred and Sue Thumhart, Kyle and Carla Craig, Weezie Jenkins, Steve Connor, Judy and Roger Heath, Denise Fort, and Jake and Donna Bickley. And let us say we would not be here at all if it weren’t for Steve and Louise Carroll.

We also want to acknowledge a lot of people we don’t even know. We are grateful for the many marijuana breeders and growers who have labored for years in the shadows. As Michael Pollan described them, “the best gardeners of my generation” went underground to develop new cannabis strains with astonishing properties to heal and relieve pain.





ABOUT THE AUTHORS




David Deardorff and Kathryn Wadsworth are the authors of four previous books on plant diagnosis and organic solutions, beginning with their award-winning best seller, What’s Wrong With My Plant? (And How Do I Fix It?), which enables you to be a plant doctor, no PhD required. Adrian Higgins of the Washington Post calls their work, “one of the best books I’ve seen for guiding the gardener through the maze of maladies that can visit garden plants….This book is a valuable tool and long overdue.” Dominique Browning of the New York Times says, “The information is concise….The illustrations are clear, the remedies organic. I promise you, things will go wrong. Be prepared.”

Deardorff and Wadsworth are authors and photographers who travel extensively to hold popular workshops and lectures across the country. Deardorff’s PhD in botany and years of experience as a plant pathologist informs their shared expertise. He has served on the faculty of the University of Hawaii, where he coordinated research in plant pathology, and at Washington State University, where he served as faculty advisor to the Master Gardener program. Wadsworth’s skill as an author and naturalist illuminates the connection between gardens and nature. She has led eco-tours to wilderness areas around the world and served as executive editor of research journals. They have nurtured plants in their own nurseries and gardens in the U.S. desert southwest, the Pacific Northwest, and Hawaii.

They have appeared on numerous radio shows throughout the United States, including Martha Stewart LivingRadio, Joe Lamp’l’s nationally-syndicated Growing a Greener World, Ken Druse’s Real Dirt in New York, and Ciscoe Morris’s Gardening with Ciscoe in Seattle.

They can be found creating bountiful polyculture gardens in Port Townsend, Washington, where David also paints work inspired by the colorful celebration of nature, and Kathryn writes crime fiction. She is currently at work on the Inspector Frodo mysteries set in Portland, Oregon.
