`bunch of cuts right there and I actually drove down there to try to get them  they're like they wouldn't even let me in the door how long ago was that six months  ago yeah but I think three months ago it was so that's how how much has changed  because I've had stuff sent to me like my personal address since then not even a  question and it's coming from the same place that they told me that where it came  from they were basically like already like anything that came out of that facility  or where those were coming from were getting flagged immediately waiting until it  got to the destination but it's crazy that they're able to call your cell phone it  was two my my address but they were able to get my cell phone number right which  that's really what kind of was like I mean they know everything already is as it is  but they already flagged you that's good because the other novelty items the seeds  you know so so we shipping seeds is no big deal right so like we ships we ship  seeds the problem still lies in with the banking you know I don't want to put too  much info out there but we are first C drop let's just say that all that money got  seized we didn't get a dime that's because you dealt with PayPal we dealt with  PayPal yeah we dealt with PayPal but but trying to set up anything through a bank  even with that right now is we've encouraged I mean it's a pain in the butt stay  back Banks yeah in uh in Michigan I mean we all have to have it for you know the  license side so there's a couple credit unions that are very friendly and uh you  know we'll look out for you but at the same point in time uh what you're doing you  can still go through the car I can give you the name of the credit union that we're  using they'll take it they'll usually use the Cannabis business no problem right  but um the problem is for how you guys are going through on like the website of  accepting payment you're not just going to throw your ACH information out there  right compared to like a click and a pay where it's easy for PayPal and the other  places yeah yeah definitely a definitely a rookie mistake for sure a lot okay a lot  of money now just from my understanding a few months ago three to four months ago  the DEA rescheduled to where you now like a hydro store now obviously check with an  attorney right but Hydro Store retail store can sell seeds over the counter doesn't  matter the genetic just matters that it's under 0.3 THC cuttings over the counter  that's completely legal as long as you can't take that cutting and test it and it  doesn't test over 0.3 THC then you can sell it and that's why you're seeing a lot  of these companies that are shipping Nationwide um clones cuttings seeds it's just  like opening the door and I think there's a lot of people sleeping on it oh they're  they're doing my email gets my work email randomly I don't even know these  companies bought some place in Boston there's all these clone companies I'm  constantly getting spammed emails yeah it's insane yep just because the new  regulations so we'll we'll see how that goes I know there's a lot of companies that  are doing some stuff right now that that are going to be pretty interesting so we  you guys are from Michigan and Michigan Star Race what's the Michigan market like  right now it depends you know grow some good weed still get some decent prices you  know I have 100 lights in the Trap you know you can still get I mean you got a lot  of lights and you still get a good price for it but I mean it's but it's a supply  and it's a supply and demand thing like hit or miss I've shut down a lot of lights  because like I'm not gonna oversupply right like I'm not gonna like yeah I try to  put my heart and my time into my rooms and good good flour just like you know I  mean and we still get paid you still get good tickets good fire good weed that  smoking it still gets good tickets you know and and uh I know a lot of other guys  that are more on the smaller side that they put their time in and they're getting  good if it's smoking it's you're getting good prices but there's a lot of people  that that you know for lack of better terms aren't getting that that product and  that's where when you get when you when you go out of the category of fire and you  fall into this we'll call it mids Market you're in that what 600 to 1000. a pound  flooded at that 600 to a thousand on uh like metric side right you know there's a  there's a lot of issues there there's a lot of people that if you go and talk to  them like as a facility wise and you ask them like where their Labor's head and  what it costs for them to like uh produce a pound like trim done like it doesn't  matter like what what's your you know PPE what's your licensing costs what's`

`everything I think I've had maybe three people be able to actually answer that  question out of that and a lot of people overdo uh where they're at on that and  then they're just putting out what they need to put out and they're just trying to  hit numbers but they're not even doing that because hey okay you know I was with a  facility that their whole entire thing had hop Lane set them back I don't know how  long they're back right now their whole entire facility went down like the entire  and it's a huge facility and like I don't want to say anything on camera I'll tell  you guys who it is off camera because uh but yeah I mean this devastated this  company and it's uh it's it's it's crazy what can happen in the market you know  there's nothing for error right no there's zero room even if you grow good weed too  you gotta have a name for yourself you know so yes any new guy that walks in still  growing fire like it just doesn't really matter you know so some of these guys that  have been around that have a name for themselves or people know you know they can  sell their weed so it's really it's really where the markets are in metric you look  at the you know Chris you know he had a you you had a Brandon you know yeah right  there's a lot it's called what it is [Â __Â ] I had a brand in the Trap and that's  where you know I came from and I think it's also the respect from that and I'm not  going to put something in a bag that isn't going to that I wouldn't smoke just to  get a number on it if it doesn't make the I've had I've had buttons I still  remember that phone call yeah I've had runs where I've gotten hit genetics from  breeders and literally had like 36 lights going on 100 light room I'm like I'm  [Â __Â ] running all of this into hydrocarbon like I'm done I'm not doing it not  putting anything out with my name I not a live person like just like trim like you  know flower it's it's not worth it because that's where you can really mess your  name up in the market there's not a lot of cultivators that aren't looking uh and  doing things different and instead of saying like I run 10 tables 100 light room  100 light rooms and I'm not like now I'm looking at it I'm like okay this one's  gonna be for rosin this one really is good for hydrocarbon so I'm gonna use these  two tables these two tables and all this is sellable flower that I'm gonna you know  pre-pack and do whatever with there's not a lot of people that are trying to think  of that and scale of that and get different you know skus out and try to actually  make it but if you're not working with the the right people in the right company  and the like I mean like with you guys this like facility advisors too like not  just like you know Athena is like a company itself it's different like it's  different than any other company that I've ever worked on not it's more than  nutrients you know like that's the thing it's it's way it's it's so built above  that like I can call either you guys and I'm sure I could call you Brandon or Chris  even at like whatever time you know say hey I'm having a problem this is what's  going on you know and I'll get that answer or at least be able to bounce it back  with somebody and sometimes it's that second voice it's not we don't know  everything right but if we bounce ideas off each other we can figure it out  together I mean I've talked with JJ I've never met like him personally but like  I've like been like yo Dylan and Max are ignoring my phone calls there have been  multiple times where like bro so so like you may call me right and what you don't  see is like I call Max and Max can't figure out he calls Henry Henry's like I don't  know I'm calling Chris you know Chris is like no it but then and then it relays  back all back to you no Henry Henry's the best builder though he really is he's  like no I've got this this is fun yeah I'll never forget the time where we were  sitting in a meeting and uh you know they were a company that we were talking to  was like I mean what's stopping us from breaking this down and making this  ourselves and you were like you're looking at it you know These Guys these guys  right here you know so it speaks volumes you know what we what we do as a team not  just the product we put out so it's experience so you're saying mids are between  600 to 1000 right now in Michigan I'd say that's legal and Blacklist is caregiver  on par with metric look yeah it's they say about the same pricing across the board  yeah yeah it's the same pricing yeah but I'm I'm I think that it's just like me  being honest I think that that caregivers grow better weed uh I do I hate to say it  like they they don't have as much to manage yeah well but it's it's listen there's`

`so much and I I'm gonna take that back I don't hate to say it because the thing is  is that there's so many you know corporate sides that are just looking this as like  a a nominational amount instead of like putting it it like love into it I mean  [Â __Â ] I talked to Jay and it's like that's the only guy I can call it like three  o'clock in the morning and he's up in his room because that's when he works yeah so  you know he's a late night kind of guy but that's that's it it's like there there's  uh caregivers like the caregiver crafted is I think that some of the best you know  Market stuff that's on the market right now personally yeah because I mean me you  our homie can work in our garden you know not compared to 20 employees sitting  there trying to all do the same thing I mean I have four feet of ownership I have  four people that run 300 lights in my facility right I'm one of the four exactly  yeah so uh you know like you there's uh it's crazy because like getting into this  and now it's like you're like playing like you're playing God in these rooms  because you have so much uh availability to change things and sometimes it's like  too much like it's too much data and that's where you start getting lost in things  don't get me wrong there is there's some uh there's some big facilities out there  that crush it you know oh of course and they got talent but you know most of them  most of them choke so it's just too much to handle Michigan doesn't have any tax on  cultivation they have a 280e that they do have but you're able to it's stores can't  stores get hit real hard on like the distros basically get real hit real hard on  the taxation processing facilities get a different tax bracket and cultivations get  they can write off basically a large amount yeah the for not like how it is in  California like because in California it's crazy what you guys have to pay there  for my understanding in Michigan there's no cultivation tax no oh no there's  nothing like for example here in Nevada where I grow there's uh 15 for the state  three percent for the city a total 18 gross of just cultivation tax that's  cultivation tax see like no we we have our 280 like everybody else there's no  cultivation tax so I have to pay 18 while you guys pay zero yeah and they're  getting more I mean I mean we're getting to that yeah right I mean so what for sure  yeah we're if you're growing fire without a brand what are you getting per pound  without a brand fire not in bulk no exactly like like folks like like and that's  let's say both like A's and B's right so that's like how the Michigan you'll  consider it so you have your A's and B's and your C nugs right so like instead of  just like everything going together in one they'll separate it even where you have  like you're like Prime like packageable will be your bulk so and they're getting  like like even less even less than that that's about the same on the on the I I  can't I have homies that hit me up that like are new into the market that are like  like dude my lights are about to get shut off I need like six eight hundred and  it's like good weed it just hurt my buddies grow some fire and they get 1000 to  1200 man yeah I was on the plane sitting next to a guy that owns like 16 dispensers  in the US for Michigan he said he can get nice ass pounds all day in Michigan for  600 bucks says he does a deal right now check this out I don't know that I forget  the name of his his uh his dispensary but they do two and a half ounces for 99. out  the door retail retail wow yeah but here's the same thing at the same point in time  that like that dude was telling you ten percent of the truth so like what he's  actually getting he's getting that [Â __Â ] he may have gotten like say he got like  200 units he got 10 pounds at that price maybe and then the other 190 is remediated  nasty like like nasty like nasty nasty like I can't even get into it like it's like  I've never seen one of these ounces and I I go to stores a lot because you know I  have to go there and I have to talk to the owners because I also take care of not  just like the cultivation but I'm also there online the retail side so like I go in  there and make the connections and like talk with the store owners and there's  never been one time that I'm like holy [Â __Â ] I need that 50 ounce right now you  know it's like it's booty it's seated yeah they're not even putting it out are they  I mean that's all just no it's in a black Miler so no one can see it and it's  sealed so they don't rip it open in there and then everybody events there's a  market for it though there is a market for it yeah market for it there is what are  you getting right now packaged uh package right now 25 and 8th wholesale so that`

`comes out to 32 a pound that's good you could do business at that yeah no you can  what's your cost to produce uh 456 a pound about the numbers because there's four  people that are at the cultivation uh and at the same point in time it's it's the  the ease of having it automated but you still have to be there like okay we have`  

`four people in a day-to-day basis we do Outsource when it comes to trimming we hand  trim everything so we have trimmers that come in and that's also put into that  pound price so like that is you know average right now in Michigan and is anywhere  from like 100 to 150 uh a pound trimmed like when you break down the pound price so  you had that impressive yeah so when you break that into it you think that's cheap  oh that's really cheap let's see I think that's ridiculously expensive everything  for cultivation has gone up except for the price of weed my my highest cost for 50  bucks it's higher than my electrical how many how much do you know how much you're  paying per kilowatt delivered uh seven cents you're paying seven cents yeah no yes  seven cents seven cents and then like and then it's like what electric bill right  right no but like there's other ways of doing it and like this is just like me and  this is I hope everybody listen to this because like when you're sitting there you  can actually like in any state that you're at you can actually get a Transformer so  like once your primary or secondary power right so if your light grow is uh  secondary you're coming in straight to the poll to your CT cabinet and then it goes  into a Transformer from there but now if you're a primary you're actually having it  run into a Transformer outside that you personally purchased and then it runs into  your CT cabinet well then they'll start to change your your your cost of what it is  either 11 14 you know like what wherever you're let's say if you're at 14 cents a  kilowatt uh coming in from the poll and then you buy that Transformer and it drops  down to three cents or it drops down to uh it takes three cents off so you're at 11  cents let's just say after you do that you actually have that company owned by a  secondary LLC that's where it's going to get tricky uh and you actually charge back  to your cultivation like the three cents a kilowatt hour so it's almost like you're  writing off you're writing off more writing off more on I mean but it's there's  another LLC it's a kilowatt of electricity on Cali what I've heard is about 17  cents and the highest I've heard I've paid up to 42 cents it's uh around 10 cents  because we got a smaller Municipal Power Company and that's not PG e everybody  who's listening knows how bad PG e is it's awful out here in Nevada where I'm  located I pay six cents delivered right damn which is really good which is great  but that's but that's the thing is that like they literally so like where we're at  we're in a municipality uh and that's in like a rural area and that's why yeah and  they had to build this up how they had to build a um a substation for us like it's  crazy like we have more power than the township does in like a couple of girls  there's a grow right down the street from us that built a co-generation plan in  order to do it you know in Sacramento PG e was paying people to build Cogen plants  and that way they could as long as they had access to turn it on if there was a  power outage they could use it to support the grid so people were making that trade  do you think where the Michigan Market is right now is a sustainable for you  obviously yeah what I think needs to happen is I think that they uh you know this  is gonna probably piss some people off that watch it but I mean it's just me being  real I think that they need to do like moratorium on licensing because they're  handing them out there's these access grows out there that it's great but they're  not do okay so they own 20 licenses right 30 licenses uh but I I mean what do I  think they're really doing I think that they're back door in packs in and then just  [Â __Â ] the whole market up uh that's a real thing in Michigan for sure because  listen it's it's different this isn't Michigan's not Nevada it's not California  they don't have that season that you need to take it for an outdoor to be an  outdoor so like you can't get that little extra burst you know this year was  actually a lot nicer I mean it was just up 70 up until like four days ago but uh  they don't have that and a lot of people that come from like out of state like come  come from uh uh you know like California or uh you know uh Cali or or I'm sorry  Kelly Nevada Oregon Washington they try to come grow in Michigan and they have it's  a rude awakening yeah yeah the humidity and the cold temperatures come fall is no`

`joke yeah and and they don't know how to do it and then they can't get it executed  fast enough and they don't have referred trailers and they you know they're they're  trying to put everything into like uh you know make hot dog water out of it or  discip you know so yeah I know a lot I know a lot of big farms this year that  killed it um that did really well and I know a lot of big farms that that came up  severely short on their projected numbers like severely short like hardly made  money short yeah because they just try to pad the pocket of their investors and  then after they do that they just flip it back around you know so they try to get  the investor money out then everybody else kind of loses a little bit those fat cat  uh you know numbers my cost to produce here in Nevada with tax is just about 750.  but in Nevada they have a fair market value per pound of bulk and the fair market  value is like two grand okay and so they charge you 18 on two grand not even for  what you really sell it oh my God so not only do you get smashed on the 18 percent  more than what you really sell it for yeah 350 bucks so but what you're saying  though because like it you are a light up right yeah okay so you're like that and  you have to put that in consideration as like indoor yeah that is actually getting  that number exactly and I'm sure you you know I know I've seen some of your product  you know what it looks like so but still if there's somebody else that's you know  lower on the totem pole they're paying that price yeah the big my biggest problem  out here in Nevada is I don't do packaged flour I just sell bulk right so what what  I need to change as a business is packaging my fire because as soon as I package  the flour I get between 18 to 22 dollars an eighth right um so it brings it up to  like 25 20 to 2200 bucks right so that's what we're starting to do now then I'm  paying fair tax because I think what's going on is what what is going on is that  I'm just selling bulk for 1400. other people are packaging it you know and making  the money out why I'm getting hit on the tax of that two thousand dollar tax yeah  yeah exactly why not make it worth two thousand yourself and at least get taxed out  that's that's what we're doing now I know there's a you know there's a I've white  labeled for a couple other companies myself you know yeah where they've done that  and I've you know bulked out you know 10 to 50 pounds to them and then they put it  under their own and then they're like oh don't worry we got you we got you and then  all of a sudden I look at the retail price I'm like what you know so yeah you know  there's there's a difference it's a play out there yeah I think the BlackMart in  Michigan Black Market Michigan is definitely still sustainable I mean um I know for  me personally I mean um and a lot of guys I know I mean cost per pound you know in  the black market about 250 to 300 a pound if you're automated to produce to produce  yeah super cheap no you know like I I gotta I I mean I have you know 60 to 80 light  spots that we check in once or twice a week you know it's it's it's it's not um as  demanding as as something something like Chris is at right um and uh I think it's  it's sustainable but I think people have to watch how much they're they're  producing I mean I know a lot of guys that went hardcore like hard hardcore for a  lot of years and I just don't think that that's that that's not sustainable I think  if you start over producing and that's that's kind of what I'm seeing the people  that are over producing are the people that are calling me or you know hey um can  you help me can you help me can you help me it's like stop producing so much you  know what I mean you don't need that much right now New York does but I mean that's  the thing is that like you know uh coming on that for us we just look at it a  little bit different what's now going into rosin what's instead of just being a  cultivation side what's going in Horizon uh if there is a good uh like hydrocarbon  that actually does very well we'll do that and then the rest is into usable flour  so you just have to figure out where you're at but like the thing that kills on the  the like Stateside and like the metric side is the cost to test thing the cost of  this so if you're running like 10 varietals a room you know you start to add up and  every time that it's a batch over 50 pounds too then they take like a quarter pound  of weed after every 50 pounds and then they start I mean there's just always  numbers that are coming out of that and you know like something hits the floor like  in the Trap if like I mean sorry guys something hit the floor I'd be like well all  right no but like you know in the in that and the legal it's not like that like`

`it's like oh I've thrown away more weed than I've ever wanted to I'm like oh yeah  you know it sucks Chris Duran I get to answer more questions this might get to sit  back and watch these guys grow I got more questions for you for sure myself yeah  yeah let's do this why are we here fade so we've been working on it when do we  start working on fade nine months I think was when uh we first started giving out  some of the goodies for testing yeah yeah RNG it for probably eight months nine  months yeah yeah so I'd have been in discussion um you know I don't know who who  the idea started with but it had been a discussion for a while and how we  effectively moved to get this out I think it really started on that podcast that we  did a long time ago and you started talking about the nitrogen discussion and just  less and less and less yep and then people started doing crazy stuff change in  ratios converting plants and then we had to stop some of that I think is where this  kind of came from so we had to come come up with a viable option to um not get Bud  rot let plants finish naturally you know and uh get all the nitrogen out really I  mean it's where we're at flushing is such a controversial conversation with so many  Growers some are saying flush some are saying not what do you think it is about  flushing that some Growers deal like what I think the concept of a flush is is  still solid right there's you're kind of doing a couple things here you're you're  trying to reduce certain nutrients and you're trying to stress out a plant you know  get some genetic expression right we're all trying to stress we've talked about  this and uh but what kind of stress are you really trying to give the plant you  know there's certain stresses that the plant can can manage and it's going to make  it express and you're going to start to get this finished this is where where fade  actually came from was you know people were doing like two week flushes three-week  flushes and starting to get crazy well it's like a recipe for Bud rot right you  know calcium losing a lot of these micros and we're all growing in cocoa and  rockwool at this point nobody's growing big old pots once a day watering or  anything and then they get these cool looking giant nugs and you know it's all  about rock butter rots but try this everywhere and that's just it's tip burn you  know it's the same thing um happens in all kinds of crops this is super common you  know you guys grow in human environment a tip burn Bud rot whatever it is it's more  common in humid environments get less transpiration you're talking about killing it  with managing the environment that's what I bet a lot of the new Growers are having  trouble with all that humidity you know and they just have damp rooms and then I  mean the list of problems just goes on and on and on right from there and it's like  you know that's an issue so we're trying to find a way to keep the plants you know  well fed with calcium um drop as much nitrogen out of them and give the plant  everything it's needed that's non-mobile within the plant and then let it let it  translocate this nitrogen and what we're finding you know you guys did a lot of  preliminary testing on this that's why we're all sitting in this podcast together  um you know preliminary testing was was great you know you guys are getting good  results weren't seeing any problems modified formulations a little bit um you know  I think you had some some numbers that you got over to Henry from all of your  testing yep we take all that and and then we distill it into a nice experiment at  jungle boys and we validate you guys because we love you but we have to trust but  verify yeah so we take all this information we go okay well is it just Athena love  or is this is this really working the way we designed it so we bring it in and we  run an experiment of jungle boys and and we can risk running it in a way that you  know if one of the one of the two trials if we're doing side by sides doesn't work  and we have some crop loss well that's okay because we're paying for it on another  end that's the cost of doing better is doing research so you know you guys can't  always run the same exact side by side but we can but those onion layers of like  validation that you have like that's what I love like we have we have those layers  right the layers of validation within the company that you know that's where it  should end yeah so the jungle boy's like okay now it's validated for real let's do  big rooms side by side yeah that's the only way to do it and we do it actually all  uh intro room it's all shared room so we actually randomize within the same room so  the clients as uniform as possible we try to get rid of anything the only`

`difference is one product we once we get to the very end we distill it down to one  variable only and that is it yep so and that's I don't think you can get a better  result than that so anecdotal is great we love it trust me that's what keeps us  going but we have to go go in there and verify this stuff because there's a lot of  crazy talk out there all the time too so you guys are on Instagram right with the  with flushing is calcium the main cause of botrytus and butter rot that in your  opinion yeah so there's I mean yes that's the main cause for sure is if you've got  Calcium deficiency and it doesn't happen overnight right if you're in if you're in  Cocoa it takes a little bit of time right because there's cation exchange sites so  you have a little bit of time and a buffer um and we we expect that you know when  people used to grow bigger pots there's more calcium stored in that root Zone as  you shrink the pot because a lot of people are finding out smaller pots get you  know better results for some of these these grows you know you're you're a big fan  we've talked about this a ton you know yeah a little bit smaller pot stop going so  big same concept is in hand so get a smaller pot there's less stored stored cations  in there so if you're going rockwool I you should not flush you should like never  go for a zero flush maybe the last day um because the plant has enough left in its  vascular system but otherwise no calcium you start getting weaker and weaker cell  walls as soon as you have one cell wall to collapse now you have a ruptured cell  it's damaged and there's always but try to spores floating around right butterout's  just an inch away so and then at that point it's just again it looks great on the  outside but it's because the plant is actually dying at that point yeah the immune  the immune system of the plants what you couldn't have you couldn't have it I mean  the the inside of the cell is now coming out you know the is in then it you know  destroys From the Inside Out can destroy the cells next to it and calcium is the  main one there are other immobile micro elements too that that add to that equation  you know the calcium is there calcium is one for the cell walls yeah the other ones  you know like like iron and manganese they can potentially get shuttled around  stored in the cell vacuoles um and get moved around get a little bit more buffer  there it's not huge but a little bit they're not really mobile um so calcium is the  biggie that's the one that we were really pumping first but we we found a few make  sure you have everything in there it actually gets even better results you know  like there is that next step it's not just that simple and then you know we're just  looking for expression in these plans and if they start starving of nitrogen it's  an indication you know we've we've seen it people want to go that direction we just  wanted them to do it healthy not ruin the crop Max what's your experience with with  flushing in the past and what you're doing now I mean I've flushed for you know  straight Ro I mean I think we've all kind of done this I've done three weeks two  weeks one week you know zero um you know since I've been using fade I actually get  like even distribution of fading in my plants compared to like kind of like you're  saying like tip burn on those leaves that are really close to the buds you know so  um instead of just running super low EC or straight water through I'm seeing just a  different expression using it which you know totally makes sense from the  standpoint of the chemicals so yeah you got to get that nitrogen out of there  what's the plants translocate you know from fan leaves other green tissue that  trans translocations just the plant's noticing you know it's acting accordingly so  in I just was at my spot in Nevada or just you know two hours from here about three  hours ago and every single grower in the facility is saying they're never the the  dry rooms have never smelled as loud the packs have never smelled as loud when  using fade what why is that what are they why is that happening stress the plants  vanish in its life we have more you know available cannabinoids more terpenes like  we've tested it we've verified it we validated it in the side by side you know the  that's the whole same thing start cutting out nitrogen keep the potassium High you  start getting the genetic expression I mean I don't want to don't want to stop and  act like if you can just reduce nitrogen that you're you know your trash 1994  strain is going to be like fire you need good genetics but if you want them to  express you got to pull the nitrogen out you know and it's we keep seeing that you  know everybody's seeing it now and now we finally got the test and we have the data`

`right yeah that's what we were all waiting for was to get like hard data and it's  just genetic expression and if you want to get more expression then you gotta  activate it what is it about the nitrogen that takes away from the natural flavor  of the plant I don't know if it takes away so much as as uh it delays in essence  right this isn't just in cannabis this isn't a lot of other crops if you provide  late nitrogen for a fruiting or a flowering crop it's gonna it's gonna decrease  basically and delay flowering and plants in essence and so if the plant it just  keeps lingering around it doesn't go fully into a regenerative State it's going to  stay vegetative to some level you know it's not just dedicating its resources  whereas now if it's getting resource restriction it's being encouraged you know it  will it knows that with no nitrogen life will come to an end anyway and so now  genetics are going to take over and say all right let's get to the end so it's just  extra stress yeah but a good kind of stress yep you know it if we were all just  growing for just Leaf biomass by all means just run nitrogen all day long it's  totally fine you know and and part of part of the testing you know we talked about  this is really the timing of when you want to run the fade you know I mean plants  still need nitrogen to survive where they're getting that nitrogen is important if  you make there's too little nitrogen for too long you're still going to probably  have some some total result decreases so we don't want you running this like the  whole time you have to still give your plants nitrogen until they get to the end of  their life and then you cut it off into fade and keep them with everything else  what is fade uh calcium and micronutrients really it's it was designed to be a four  Pro Line initially as a core replacement that was that's what we were hearing from  everybody running Proline was they kept changing ratios to a point where things  were getting out of hand and so we said we've got to do something better because  this is getting you know I hear you but we can't have we can't have you basically  butchering your crop in the process of getting better weed so we this is where we  came up with this was was for that and to replace core is a direct swap at two  pounds per gallon we tried to make it as simple and easy as possible and then it's  also got the complete micronutrient package just like course so you're not losing  out on that well and that's where we started was with the Pro Line yeah well  there's also a big difference too like just with the micronutrients with that  compared to just running the you know the pale the powdered calcium chloride  there's a huge difference I've seen in this thing like you can't just like it it's  not just like taking one to one right yeah like what else do you guys have inside  of that and like we started getting different like hash increases you know like of  your final hash uh you're like 40 to 70 or you know you're 40 to 120 you know and  that's what I even asked Brandon I was like hey if you ran hash have you checked  out your yield set because it's there is you know if you're looking at like I think  our last one was an increase of 1.3 percent from so uh so from it was like four  point uh 4.2 to 5.5 finish so when you start actually looking at that uh yeah how  much money is that plus yeah he complains when he goes down like point two right he  tells me all the money he's losing so 1.2 is a lot of my new washing yeah when we  do the test wash it's like 10 000 grams and then it's normally like a wash is like  a minimum of us sending out like like anywhere from 20 to 120 000 watt grams so um  you know it makes a big number especially if I mean what what is right now in  Nevada what is the price of like wholesale price of hash is there a big rosin  Market here I don't do any Ash so I don't know what are you getting per gram uh 30  or up 30 or up 30 30 a gram or more yeah that's what it is right now it's like 30  35 black market so I mean that's what I'm getting right but like if you change one  percent you're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars in a year dude I mean yeah  going from three percent to four percent it's a game changer like you can everybody  breaks down so like dinner's on you tonight yeah exactly that one percent but they  but they have what inflation but but they they have it where you you can break down  these and like how it goes down is you know they're your uh you're wet pounded like  five wet pounds is technically considered one dry pound uh for like when you're  talking with Ross and producers or I mean you've ran you've been running Rising a  long time too uh 10 years something yeah exactly so you know those differences when`

`you get even a half a percent difference it's big numbers yeah there's a huge  market for it Michigan yeah there's a huge there's a huge market and then there's I  mean then now all these people that are doing this like donuts are like a big thing  here right now big thing right now so um I do I I see it more of like a niche and I  see it more of like uh like if I wanted to like have some donuts like I don't think  personally myself it's like um for where the market's at I don't think people are  really gonna just every consumer because a lot of people are stuck in these like 50  ounces 60 ounces 75 ounces do you want a one dollar or do you want an 80 joint that  you're gonna smoke or do you want an 80 in smoke a whole ounce of it right I want  the 80 joint I do right yeah right if there's a market for everything right it is  and uh but it's still a big market so people what they're doing is they're taking  their 40 and 70 you selling those uh and then as as rosin and then selling it like  that and then after they do that they take you know anything up to like 120 they're  either putting it in carts or they're putting it into Donuts or I mean [Â __Â ] now  what people are doing is they're actually taking distillate and mixing it with  rosin and calling it full spectrum rosin infused pens nice was that was that flower  that you brought and showed us was that was that grown was that off a recent batch  yeah yeah fire yeah thank you yeah fire so you you were you were with us from the  beginning Chris on this stuff yeah and and you tested calcium chloride calcium  chloride yep you did obviously you ran Pro Line then we gave you some calcium  chloride did that then we ran some fade and you did that what was the major  differences between calcium chloride and fade the the micronutrients uh the  addition of that and also when your yields go up you know a quite a percentage and  then noticing because the calcium chloride the difference is is that that stuff is  horrible to work with first off yeah man I mean I I hope you know we had a lot of  conversation about this about sending it out to you guys and like I think you were  the one who got the instruction because Henry was I think uh conveying a lot of  this was like you know the with the powder you're gonna melt your melt your tanks  if you're not paying attention it gets uncomfortably on the side and then it blows  out and then you're in trouble so no I I won't say that it happened but it did so  uh I guess those instructions didn't make it through so well it wasn't like that so  but I called him I was like is it supposed to be this hot dude I made it like two  pounds a gallon it's hot and uh my five gallon bucket was like flimsy dude the  nicest the nicest thing is uh you know like I never talk about like uh any other  nutrient companies and I never will on this side of it but this is like something  that can be be used with every nutrient line like that that's the difference with  this product and it's not just specific to you know like an Athena product it's  something that can be used with every single company that's out there I personally  think because there's a lot of lack this is the first product in my personal  opinion that is like an actual finisher because every everything runs crazy hard on  nitrogen and when you're looking in in these uh um you know everything that they're  doing and all the products that everybody's running in every line in other lines  too so I think this is the changer it's it's hard you know there's positives and  negatives to that the negatives are that we haven't tested it you know and it's  like we haven't tested with Blended yet we're testing a little bit Yeah but but  your point is it's hard to we won't come out and say use Fade with Blended because  we don't have enough data to back it up we look at it as these Growers livelihood  depends on what information we give them so if we just go out and say hey use it  with Blended it'll work great because of what we see on numbers and not in the  cultivation we're putting people's businesses and lives in our hands and that  information could hurt them right I agree but I'm gonna look in this camera it  works [Â __Â ] great with Pro-Line so you know I know because I run Proline and it  makes a difference and and the difference is is I can't speak on Blended so I can't  but you know I have somebody that runs a a competitive um nutrient right that we're  homies with and I I gave it to him to run I didn't tell them what it was and he's  smashing with it he knows like the the makeup of it he doesn't really know like I  explained to him what what I was like here put this in your plants you know I  explained to him what it was but I didn't tell him who it was from or what it you`

`know the owner indeed had the r d on it yeah yeah yeah so like and he's like blown  away right and he was able to adjust it to his nutrient like that he's running the  reason why we're stickers on that is because we have three tech tech Team guys well  we got 14 facility advisors Nationwide and then we have three guys that are on the  tech team that answer DMS emails phone calls and when they're dealing with hundreds  of Growers a day whether it be you know whatever communication chain and these  Growers are like well I'm using Proline but I'm adding Cal Mag and PK and this and  that but I'm having lockout and my shit's dying I don't know why and it's well how  do I help you like how can I how can I help should I give your phone number out no  I'm just saying no I get enough of those all right so like whenever somebody gets a  hold of me that's running Athena whether it's Pro Liner Blended and the first thing  I always ask them is are you only using what we suggest because if they're not my  flow chart for diagnosis goes like [Â __Â ] over it's like okay now when you got to  take that into consideration what's your then right away I'm usually saying  especially if they're using like a monoslic acid I'm like where's your pH in your  room Zone because I know it's [Â __Â ] up right so it's like it's a whole different  it's a whole different diagnosis rock wall it's definitely [Â __Â ] up if you're  using cocoa IT Coco is a lot more forgiving than rock wool there's like I said in  the when we first started talking in the beginning was there's so many different  variables that people aren't like looking in in the in the just the sensors and the  data that you can get back it's crazy right so like I went in somebody's running  like I went into a facility and they're having a bunch of issues with their dry  backs and trying to figure this out and like I I straight up I'm just like pick the  pot up I'm like it's [Â __Â ] light you know a lot more water more you know and  then they're like huh then I'll squeeze the sides of it and pull out the and I'm  like yeah water more like you're you're chasing this dry back and I was like where  are your sensors so they have like 40 lights in this room okay and I'm a d guy so I  run D's and like I'm sitting there and I'm looking at it his sensors are right up  in the front okay so you have like one light here one light here one light here you  know that you're actually getting and then there's space out even farther but like  the plants that are having the problems and reading the wrong or middle of your  [Â __Â ] room so it's just like you're not getting the data because you're not  looking at the plants everybody's just thinking oh the sensor is going to tell me  this is what's going to tell me it's like no you got to go there start to feed it  and then if it starts to look I mean you have three days to like really to see if  there's something that's actually validate Those sensors hardcore yeah and and  that's like you're gonna sit there and run something I pick that up and I'm like up  yep here you need to you know water it more they're like do I have these see I'm  like no [Â __Â ] water it more like what what's going on like keep it where it's at  and just run it like you guys need to start looking at this and then they're like  well the sensor says this I've got I've gone to the point using these sensors where  I could look at my sensors and be like this room's [Â __Â ] crushing you know  temperatures here humidity is here your moisture is here I have a lot of experience  using them for the last few years now kind of thing right you probably validated  the sensors who said run the cycle and you stared at it and felt that pot oh I got  this tiny little room yeah and you did this for 20 minutes and you're like okay  this is what the sensor means right when they're done right though they crush and  you still obviously got to be there I walk in my room five six times a day you know  just open the door to look at the plants and see how they're looking but you know I  could now I could you know when I'm gone here for seven days I can pull my app up  and be like Yep they're in the zone you know EC's swinging here moisture's here I'm  at this point in the plant's life you know so I no I agree I mean that like I said  the sensors are not I think it's one of the that people just trust everything so  much without validating the sensors like sitting there and actually running and oh  this new varietal that I got from here that uh is it's supposed to be running like  this you got to know like this strain likes this EC bouncing between this or you  know this dry back too so everything's a little bit different you know if I run I  run two strains on one zone and you know this one's bouncing here that one's`

`bouncing there you know most of the time they look different because one one likes  it better than the other so there's a lot to it but they are nice yeah for sure for  sure I mean Max you're running a blended line and you're using fade I am yeah yeah  so I've got almost two full runs of it right now I'm about to harvest here in about  10 days um but just the difference in like the smell in the room the expression of  the plant um you know like you said like I I personally do huge dry backs towards  the end too so as much stress as I can give them but since I've used fade dude like  my leaves are like that you get that good golden color towards the end that you  just don't get like the dying Decay like you do just flushing with straight nothing  or you know really low core you know whatever but it's a it's been a big difference  dude for sure yeah I don't have I don't have any side by sides you know I've got  one room with one zone one tank I don't have a side by side of running fade versus  not which you know that's the true side by side but from what I'm seeing right now  like yeah it totally makes sense from you know a mineral standpoint too so well we  appreciate you testing for us because yeah well Brandon just said you know we have  to give you the right info because it's also your livelihood and your business  you're willing to risk it on some trust for us so we we do appreciate that you know  I can't oh yeah say enough from the rest of our R D team you know to shout out to  you guys to you know put a little bit of your livelihoods on the line knowing that  I love it yeah I mean there's a risk right I'm running 100 lights on it without  even a blink of an eye I know you know well I'm running 300 lights on well 200.  yeah we almost melted your tanks and here you go you're like whatever the thing is  it's like if if you don't try it you're you're never gonna know where you could be  at and this is like I mean before when I was running I was pulling core off like  and I was that guy that was like pulling core off at that point if it made sense  yeah you thought it made sense yeah well it it does to some level right but that's  when I was having the calcium the calcium chloride powdered instead before that  right and then that's like that's what ends up happening is you're doing that yeah  and then there's also a lot of things that you know like what we're talking about  what you brought up uh uh the defoliation a lot of people did do defoliations at a  certain point you're taking a ton of nitrogen out from that and then you start  running the fade like I do a heavy defoliation and now this one we're not doing a  heavy defoliation like right towards it and so I'm gonna do basically I'm gonna try  to do a heavy defoliation like right at the end like right there at the end so that  way I still have the nitrogen pulling back on the nitrogen and then do like a quick  defoliation heavy defoliation two days before crap yeah so Chris you saw yield  increases in hash right and then where were your testing numbers up THC THC then  it's not like some [Â __Â ] testing numbers anybody that knows me I don't test and  try to dry it down to like seven percent and so people know in this like podcast  like what a lot of people are doing is they're drying their [Â __Â ] down so they  can get those test results like I gave uh you know Henry the test results that I  had and and uh Taylor and everybody of like hey this is the actual moisture content  and it's like at 11 11 and a half percent moisture content and hitting like I think  like 29 like THC not total THC THC so like when you're starting at that and I know  it's a THC driven Market but it's still it's it's the uh the the number one thing  it's not dried down like those results were back and then I had you know side by  side of two different varietals actually yeah two different varietals two different  tests and uh you can see actual the cannabinoids the Terps everything I mean it was  all in all uh like 30 percent higher so you can say three percent four percent five  percent but it's thirty percent like total if you want to talk let's start from the  beginning Athena Pro Line no calcium chloride what same genetic same room same app  you know what were your THC number total to you uh like like THC let's say like  this is just I like I have I know that like Taylor has a data so a hundred percent  she does but I'm just going to use this as an idea of just running like the Pro  Line like the first time that we were in it 3-0 all the way through right three all  all the way through one day flush I'm one of those guys that don't believe in the  heavy flush the the 7 14 days like I'm more of like I I don't even really believe  in the hard taper either personally myself I like to have it where I'm running 3-0`

`then a little bit like start to gradual down a little bit and then keep it I I  don't because I can flush my whole entire make the median Domino like nothing um uh  in in one flush just around and punch through it uh now so let's say let's get back  to where we're talking with THC content running straight through is like let's say  uh a varietal at like 23 24 THC just like three all the way through um and then  doing pulling off core uh at that point in time at like they like 52 uh going from  there uh it was an added like two percent increase so then it'd be like you know uh  27 28 and then now going uh uh from that and using the fade r d with the  micronutrients yeah the full one the Job the full one yeah is is like 30 plus now  all right yeah and that's like but you have to look at it it's in the in the  differences of the tests that were actually sent over the moisture content it's  funny it's like the ones that are like higher are that are lower or at like 10 10  and a half percent moisture content in it the water activities like lower and then  the ones that are like the higher THC is a higher moisture content wow yeah but  that's that's that when when we were talking you hit I look at everything as you  have to we did not change anything so we did not change any variables we kept all  our controls the same and we used that that was the variable yeah so it's a  sequential trial and that's as close as we can get from most of our external  testers right I think it'd be real hard to ask to be like all right hey just give  us two benches in your room and let's just just let us know yeah nobody's doing  that but I've seen it I'll give you [Â __Â ] two benches before we started this no  I think I think that the Trust on the side of like what you guys have here's you  know from switching over with running over with other nutrient companies and other  lines and like you know I know you guys are facility advisors you guys all work  together like I'm uh you know not a facility advisor I'm a cultivator I I you guys  support me I love supporting your product uh I I don't get paid by you guys there's  nothing on that right like the difference is is that when I run nutrients where  there's no [Â __Â ] biofilm in the in anything there's like it's super sterile in  the environment that I have to have for passing testing at you know the colony  forming units and for total use of mold that we have and how stringent it is and  you know all the things it's an amazing products yeah and it helps my business so  it feeds my family like listen I'm not doing this for like myself or cloud or  anything I have two kids Partners have kids you know we're doing this like so that  if you know like I always tell people if I if my sons want like to be a social  worker or like something like a ballerina or like anything it doesn't matter and  they can't afford to have what they are able to do uh I want to be able to help do  that and you guys are the ones that are helping do that for my family and other  families there round too thanks appreciate it but like now this this is real talk  this is like uh I I it's a game changer and I know you guys I I noticed like I've  been watching how you guys talk about it you don't want to put out anything crazy  but like I'm telling everybody it's [Â __Â ] real so it is I know you guys won't  put anything out until it's a hundred percent at the point where you guys are at  but it's real it's I if it wasn't we wouldn't even be sitting at this conversation  you guys wouldn't be running with Ivan in any of his rooms I I mean that's my  personal opinion yeah so so we have like other than Chris we had like a lot of  other homies you know like like you know that within the family that ran at smaller  scale like some other cultivators from Michigan smaller scale um guys that you know  you know and it was funny because like my joke with uh my joke with Henry is that  we kind of made him like Pablo Escobar we like seriously not listen oh it is it was  responsible Brandon says send it to this guy send it to my homie over here Henry  starts lacing up all these people right well you know we're it comes down to it's  like okay we gave you your sample you run it well these guys are hooked like crap  yeah yeah we're sharing messages regarding like bro I need my where's where's my  face where's this stuff at like you can't give it to me and then because the people  are the same results that you're seeing a lot of my other friends are seeing you  know they're seeing the same results and it takes a little bit of dialing in to get  to that point because it's that's not like just the first round that was a couple  runs right yeah so I've ran it for a couple runs but I think Henry's more if you`

`guys ever seen the movie Usual Suspects so Kaiser so say he's Kaiser so say so he's  gonna love that yeah the other day he's going to be revealing a new look at the  show yeah I just love the even senescence that I'm seeing that's like the biggest  thing I've seen in my resume you even heard one person say I want more and that's  I'm getting hit up non-stop yo I need more money it's kind of work with the  manufacturing you guys all know this right like very Hands-On with that part of  this um and it's been interesting because Henry is like a drug dealer right now for  sure he's like needing to get his picks all the time and it's like I'm busy we've  got other things in the schedule man and he's like I know we need it now and then  he'll show up at the door basically to get his fix and I'm like it was just you  know it's it's telling when you know we're giving out an r d product right it's  it's beyond pre-release at that point it was it was an r d product still an rdd  product officially um but the demand was already there and that was a little bit  interesting I think it was the missing link of any nutrient line yeah it was I  think it is and I think that like I come from a background you know this I'm a  tweaker like that's I know you've ran everything underneath the sun in combinations  everything and like we're always trying to perfect this craft always and I know  that we're we're huge on that here right like we're always trying to get better  continuous Improvement what can we do better what can we do and this is a huge  piece to that huge piece to it huge piece that's the best part about working with  this company man is this r d that we do on the back side and the you know yeah  we're coming out with with fade but like constantly trying different things and  it's not just something that we just were like oh we're gonna go we're gonna make  it and we're just gonna throw it out so you guys gonna drop a new bombshell or  something else so you guys see possibly coming out with is there something else  there's other things that we that we as opposed to confirm tests and find out if  they work and put out there's a lot of things that that just get tested to prove  that they don't work and that stuff we just tested trash yeah we just test and bury  testing very testing 30 I mean there's no point in going out the purple spray yeah  but you know we we do test and bury because we had to try there's a lot of stuff  out there that's what we do though right well and to try we have to validate  whether it's real or fancy and a lot of this comes down you know one obviously part  of jungle boys heavily there everybody's sending them the coolest [Â __Â ] under  the sun right they come up with some hair brained ass ideas and I'll get a call  from roach and he'll be like Chris tell me tell me about this that's not how roach  sounds at all but and he'll be like I need you to explain this to me he was like  somebody's sending this DM over here and and so we walked through it and we set up  something to trial it and you know he's he's willing to jeopardize his plants and  and oftentimes it is jeopardizing on those ones and it's like all right I'll send  it to you but this doesn't put my name on this anywhere like this is this is this  is someone else's bad idea you know but we'll test it because you never know what  if it works protest everything yeah we run R D's just to see how it does and for  the fun of it too you know yeah like obviously we run it because we think it's  going to do better or it has a chance you know but or somebody told you it would  yeah true you know this industry's built on that I know try this I know a million  times oh me too all right buy two supplements get one free two we've got storage  units full of [Â __Â ] that just you know tried and can't get rid of it so  interesting thing with fade that I've seen at my spot is that you look at some  cultivars and they'll yellow out but others get dark purple black yeah have you  seen that too yeah and I I've noticed like it's so what here's something crazy like  you you can a lot of people do it when they start to like add like colder water and  they start to like do certain things like I'm not changing anything different but  like there's a couple of varietals that I have that like I've never seen them like  change like I have some with like like crazy black leaves and then all of a sudden  now they're starting to like yellow out from the like inside out but just like  running streaks online I'm like [Â __Â ] hey you know like it's like it's crazy  it's like art Expressions I'm seeing her 100 different yeah so like all my  manipulations before at the end of flower running running Proline for for years`

`were based on environment taking temps down really cold taking my humidity out to  get that to get that that ex that color exchange that I wanted to get a lot of  that's what I've relied on for the expression right I'm getting that like these  rooms I'm taking I'm not even dropping my temps hello I'm running like 73 74  degrees I'm not even going as well I used to get into like mid 60s low 60s to  really try to get that black that purple I don't even have to do that I got rooms  that are like day 50 just already just purple and falling over at 76 degrees Yeah I  was a little worried because I did take a room down a little bit and I thought I  was going to turn some weed black for a second because how how dark it was going on  I'm not like I'm like uh did I just [Â __Â ] this up yeah you know like it's a lot  of lights out it worked out [Â __Â ] phenomenal so yeah it's well that's what I  thought and it was like no it's just like that's where the expression took it to it  brings out their true genetic yeah that's that's what I think the difference is in  this product that it actually brings out what it supposed what EC are you running  right now with fade just all the way to the end so that's what I'm experimenting  I've done the taper yeah so I've done the taper and now I'm doing the 3-0 all the  way through and the 3-0 all the way through is [Â __Â ] banging like in uh what a  test results don't lie I haven't smoked it yet it's just actually getting caught  right now at the facility at that 3-0 so yeah uh thanks guys appreciate it that's  what we validated that we did 3-0 all the whole run through yeah yeah so the first  run I did Trio second run I tapered this one's surreal all the way through with now  the environmental is like how I normally run them because I didn't want to run  anything too cold colder water at the end like a couple different you know like  that I normally had run through now I'm just trying to throw everything at it and  it's I mean they're like I mean colas are like because I even took it where I  started like looking at the colas and like uh like cutting them to see if there was  like any botrytis or anything because I'm like this thing has to be [Â __Â ] loaded  I mean like like this right yeah like outdoor colas yeah typical try this Bud yeah  and then I'm kind of an opener I'm like nothing and I'm like all right I'm not  gonna go scavenge this room and like cut up everything turn off all the good ones  but like normally you would sit there and you'd something that you would think  would have it would have it but it doesn't that's what's pulling the nitrogen I  just took down my first decent sized LED room for the first time I think ever LEDs  I struggle more with with botrytus than anything D's not has never been as big of a  case for me but LEDs um just present a different it's a different ball game more  biomass way more biomass under LEDs and when I say I get I would get botrytus I'm  talking out of a 20 light room I would end up with maybe like a quarter ounce we're  not talking like right but I mean I have it's something that you're normally not  used to seeing it's just like the swell that you get of those yeah three rounds in  a row no three rounds in a row using fade and not either age is going to water or  or B pushing the nitrogen and the core way too much and getting giant buds at the  end of flower and hitting that senesis right and and running it straight at first  time in under LEDs I haven't got rot like over and over three times Raw three times  in a row in the same room so it could just be luck maybe but at the third time I'm  like all right like there's there's I mean and to your point the Magnesium the iron  and the and the calcium and keeping those ratios in check all the way I think it's  super important yeah super super important but the other thing that I'm saying is  like normally I would do like heavy defoliation I think that right now I think I'm  gonna have a better on uh yield percentage right now with not doing a heavy  defoliation than doing a heavy defoliation so I can keep that nitrogen in that  plant while I pull the nitrogen off yeah pulling out of the root Zone instead let  the plant do its translocation I think I think that translocation is important for  what you're seeing not just the lack of nitrogen because yeah you can get rid of it  you know by defoliating right and that's part of what you're trying to do but but  actually forcing the plant to go I have none in the root Zone I have to I have to  change my behavior translocate nitrogen to finish the plant I think that that  sequence of events is part of what we're attributing to to the results yeah you  know and I without doing more more scientific experience in genetic work I don't`

`think we can prove that portion but it seems to be true across the board for  everybody who's trialing it right but like you know how Brandon was saying like you  know they get calls and calls and calls like the number one thing it's like hard to  tell somebody because now you start to get you put out an amazing product right so  you put out the amazing product and then you have those guys that are doing their  you know a default like at like you know either day 45 day 52 day 54 like in indoor  so they pull all the you know large families during the whole entire thing but then  they're pulling out all that nitrogen that they actually still need because they're  pulling the nitrogen off yeah from the plant from the plant so it's almost it's  very hard I can see on your guy's side of being like hey this is this is when  you're because you're giving it's funny when I talk to people and then they're like  oh this is a feeding chart I have and I'm like so you're just following a feeding  chart and any nutrient not just like Athena like you name it and I was like but you  don't know what's wrong you think you have this so you're throwing more stuff at it  you know like this is your deficiency and it's like [Â __Â ] feedmore no that's but  oh yeah yeah well I'm running a 1-5 I don't know what the problem is right right  but but the the whole thing is is that like I can see where you guys are at on that  because like and that was with talking with you downstairs when we're um having a  bite to eat and we're saying like hey you know like now instead to keep all that  the actual nitrogen from the plant without defoliating because we do it so we'll do  the heavy defoliation so that way when it comes to like actual Harvest day it's  coming through it already has its well it can just be cut quartered hung you know  yeah so uh it's easier for us now that's where laziness starts to come in because  it's easier for us so I'd rather have it or this time we're running it all all the  way through and then we'll have it where we'll either defoliate and the Harvest  days are going to be horrible sorry guys for everybody coming up soon but or it's  going to be you know uh you know maybe a day before and then pull it and it would  be fine at that point right right I mean you're not there's not much happening at  that and when we did final validations of this we changed nothing from the rest of  the practice everything else was identical between the control and the fade plants  all the all the cultural practices in the room were identical so the defoliation  was occurring at the same time everything was identical except for fade so we're we  simplified it to follow feed chart EC3 all the way through because we want to make  it simple for not just you guys in here expert Growers who love their plants and  live in there every single day but everybody else who's maybe not a savvy so that  they can get in there find a good starting spot and then you know you know hone in  those last three days when are you going to defoliate now are you going to  defoliate now that's that's the number one thing I think that's a the thing that's  going to resonate most is like you know you don't like my my lowers that I have  like and I don't really have lowers in the side of it but a lot of people just kind  of let it go right you know we'll clean it up but my blowers are like the  Expressions that the flowers are putting out now it's crazy like it's just  different down there you know it's it's it's just like they actually you know I  won't say like Top Candy like dogs but the finish of them I'm like damn you know  yeah they look they look finished even if they're not going to be that's what I'm  dancing heavy but they look right they're not just that light green fluffy lime  stuff anyway yeah yeah well we got some cool stuff actually going to be done at the  show that's what I'm like smiling you know we're talking about the look and  everything yeah like there's some good stuff going on yeah I met with Rob I caught  him on the way in and I I'm happy with what we got going on down there yeah yeah  it's gonna be a good time yeah good time uh we were talking about hop Lane viral  we'll just finish with this segment um but we were talking about hop late and  virate in Michigan is it a big problem out there right now for the people who don't  test it's not a problem yeah because they don't know see the thing is is there's  you know my screen my whole entire thing is is that there's and I'm not gonna throw  anybody on blast I really would if this is like a different type a podcast and  throw some names out there that like I really on the Michigan side that I really  want to throw on blast I'm still like friends with them but if I ever saw like two`

`of these guys I would knock their [Â __Â ] teeth out because I've purposely selling  HIV yeah I like what so what they're doing is that they're claiming that they're  getting negative tests which they are right they're getting negative tests until  they stress that plan out just a little bit and then all of a sudden it's like  exploded right and I had it happen to we we brought in some cuts from it we tested  it thank God but you know we've had some Cuts where we've gotten in and like we got  there and when we're like sitting there we're like it doesn't look right just throw  it like you know but but we have the test results from and it's like okay well I'm  done like trusting like anybody it doesn't care who it comes from like and it's  going crazy because there's people like I literally just had somebody hit me up for  a state license facility that wants um uh 4 000 cuts their whole entire facility  just got hit from it and I was like what do you mean you want 4 000 cuts and then I  was like Dylan hold on I'm gonna holler at you after this podcast dude it's crazy  though because like there's a there's this I don't know if you guys are MMA fans  I'm a huge MMA fan and the Diaz brothers have this saying that like everyone in the  UFC is on steroids they're like [Â __Â ] everyone's on steroids you know because  there's a whole debate about Ceres and I feel like that way with HIV with cannabis  like I'm like no matter what you do with how much cuts are sold the rate that  they're sold how many legal facilities depend I know I know a lot of facilities  they don't even veg they depend on you or your clone shop and I want Flats of  clones and you're opening yourself up for that that possibility of of just of  damage right from from this from this virus from this virus and and like I test and  we test and we test them but sometimes I feel I'm like the best thing I can do is  use my eyes the super sanitary and and try to practice and and when I bring things  in segregate them because I've tested things through to me I've tested things  locally I've tested and tested and gotten different results left and right left and  right I've had something test positive that I've ran it was the strongest plant and  never and then I've tested that through another organization and it was clean I've  tested stuff that passed and then we ran it and it started out right so I've just  seen so many inconsistencies as well I just it's it's a it's a huge problem I think  it's a play I think the only thing we're gonna have you have to make meristem  tissue culture a standard period yeah a hundred percent is the key word yeah tissue  culture has to be a standard in the industry at every single facility anywhere if  they're bringing Cuts in if their everything comes from meristem tissue culture  right it's the only way it's going to be able to be fixed and I honestly I don't  even know if that's going to fix it I think it's so far past at this point in time  with breeders that have bred with it and have it going on right now I mean there's  studies coming out that they're finding it in seeds lots of lots of diseases are  spread via seed coat yeah and so you have to do seed coat sterilization but you you  get what I'm saying though on top of that so I think you know someone background  right UC Davis heavily um and we fought with disease all day long people were  keeping uh lineages of plants for decades that were just contaminated and sometimes  you would have to grow them just so they could get the genetic expression out of  them because they needed to basically just turn over the next generation of plants  and so you do seed treatments you have to accept some of it you'd have to Coal  plants we would do batch testing you know you'd test take 40 plants together and  test them all as one and if that batch failed then you throw all 40 of them out and  like you know you got to get efficient with your testing also you can't test every  cut but you got to find a way to do it but you know there is a way to clean up  plants it's just not simple you know I mean there's entire Industries built around  cleaning up plants and genetics that's you know go look at the wine industry you  want to see what it looks like look there because that's that's been a huge part of  what they do is giving out clean stuff you know and I'm using the wine industry  because I'm from UC Davis is is my background but you know they have a foundation  plant program they provide clean plants you know and it's a big deal and they fight  viruses all the time this is multi-billion dollar industry also high value crops  you know it's it's there it's much more mature and they're still fighting that  problem this industry doesn't have that kind of support right now and everybody's`

`everybody's a good grower they exist we have great genetics we don't have a lot of  the foundational work on the other side and I think that's if this if this industry  is going to mature in that direction that's going to have to happen yeah how did  they do it at UC Davis tissue culture was a lot of it and testing and they would  cycle through again so the original stuff before they did a lot of the genetic  testing they would actually use rating scales so a lot of these nurseries started  this work back with different flowers they were looking for viruses and they would  take it in and they'd basically do duplications in tissue culture and they'd have a  one through four rating system they use the best sensor on the planet the human  being and that's what they do they look at the plant they'd make a judgment call  and then they bring it back in and read tissue culture now they can do it a little  bit better they'll take tissue culture from you know a couple cells from a meristem  you know and then sometimes they'll treat it with different antibiotics or  antiviral chemicals to try to clean it up and kill the disease off and then you  start with a couple cells of meristem meristem is where it's at yeah you really  have to I mean otherwise there's too many cells if you're getting something you  know even a micro propagation is too big you got to get down there like tiny you  know and that's and then you got to come back and that takes months you know it's a  slow process but that's probably the only way you can truly get past it you know  some of these sometimes you can also breed make a cross and if it's a disease  that's not transmitted inside the seed only on the seed coat then potentially you  can do seed coat treatments and you can get some things going on there but  obviously if you're making crosses you just change your genetics you know it's a  clone heavy industry I know for a lot of like you know for me not being in the  legal market like you know I'm I'm a caregiver grower you know and like I've had  anywhere from 10 to you know a couple hundred lights and anywhere in between and  like I don't it's like for me like when I started thinking about like this other  Avenue thing I got to think about now it used to be just like mildew and bugs that  was all I had to think now it's like this whole viral thing it gives me a headache  like when I got to start thinking about I gotta I look I got a quote it the other  day like 50 Grand to put this lab into my barn a full tissue culture lab I had this  company come out 50 000 fully outfitted and then I would hire somebody to pretty  much run though I don't have the time to do that right Jesus Jesus 50 G's but it  was a big room mini splits yeah there's a lot of people in Michigan that are trying  to do that and get in full tissue culture and to be able to do it it's getting the  varietals in right but other than I'm talking like how I've had we've had a couple  people come talk to us like it's not just like the hood it's not this it's not that  you know like it's there's a lot of other equipment that they're trying to bring in  and do that and then starting but it's either that or you pay like I was and I have  you know in my stable right now and I know I have more than most but probably  somewhere between 60 to 70 different genetics so if I got to get on a monthly  testing plan what am I looking at I looked into it I'm spending thousands a month  to send in to either to me or Deep Roots local to continue to test cultivars and  then what's the best best practice with that I I would just take clones and from a  small plant I'd take it as early as I could take my sample and send it in and then  then two weeks later I read something online and says oh you got to take it from my  big plant and here so it is the headache it just gives me as is like a guy that's  just trying to survive right in the industry I think so you I think for you and  having a genetics business you and mobile J I think tissue culture the 50 Grands  worth it all day oh it is it is and it's something that we're gonna it's something  we're going to do for sure it's either that or I'm just gonna go back to like model  crop and Gorilla Glue because worst thing I've heard all day the the insurance  policy on if you because you any tissue culture you have tissue culture you could  do meristem tissue culture it's just a process yeah right we want to do in our own  genetics that we're bringing yeah 100 that's I'm looking at the future of like you  know but there's but there's a lot of Home Growers that we deal with too like that  have been decimated I mean I got you know six eight like guys that like they're  they're they're like can't pay their mortgage now because they got hlv and I got to`

`tell them hey well you should get a lab it's gonna cost you like 50 correct you  know what I mean and they're and it's just now you got to worry about it from seed  and it's like I mean it's that's I know some people that that's decimated some of  my friends like small 10-12 bike rows where they're that's how they make their  their money to support their family and it's like you know and then they spend six  months trying to diagnose what's wrong taking runoff numbers this was a year or two  ago we didn't know it was as relevant in the industry you know they're taking  runoff numbers for you know three four weeks thinking that's something they're  doing why are their plans studying why is it you know yeah um yep it'd be nice to  see if you could have something like uh if someone would come out even a non-mayor  stem uh like TC to be like affordable to people because a lot of people don't know  who to reach out to there's not a lot of like open tissue culture facilities that  are you know like caregivers would be like oh here I'm sending this here I'm doing  this there's a lot of people that are doing it themselves you know but there's not  enough education out there not meristem though that's the thing mayor stomach has  to be at unlike at least on the commercial level nah I mean does meristem has to be  on a commercial level depends on how good you get I mean it doesn't it depends on  the size your mirror stem and how clean you can get Could you teach Max how to do  meristem yeah all right the microscope yeah extra to do meristemption culture as a  microscope yeah right and a steady hand in person you know and then it's the  follow-up you know you're talking about how do you protect your genetics right I  mean that's that's a big deal and how for you it's going to probably come down to  isolation you know securing a facility yeah and and getting it away basically and  you're gonna have to get in protocols in place because a lot of the big places that  provide genetics they aren't actually testing everything every every month every  year that's like you just said wildly unaffordable and the tests only have you know  an accuracy of 90 well that's not good enough anyway so you have to come up with a  different program and you have to come up with rating plans and and you know we'll  talk about this after the podcast too but there's there's a lot of work that can go  into it and I can probably point you in the right direction so for programs you  should replicate yeah that would probably help you at least avoid 80 of the  problems you're right huge [Â __Â ] headache yeah like I I grew plants in research  greenhouses that were intentionally infected with some of the nastiest diseases in  California like tomato diseases in the middle of tomato country and rice diseases  in the middle of rice country in California and that was their goal so we had to  operate around them while keeping things that were adjacent clean and happy and  healthy and so I feel your pain when you say it's a huge headache because the  people who do the work on that they run around dirty handed touching doorknobs all  day long and wearing their same lab coat in the place every day and you know I'm  having a heart attack and a headache so you know people training protocols it's a  lot of the work and it is huge work and you know those genetics are your livelihood  so then you just need to plan for what you do if they do tests or they do have some  problems if you had your choice would you put a tissue culture lab in your facility  I just Outsource it at that point in time why would you Outsource it uh just  because it would be something more added on unless like I I if I knew uh there are  some very reputable ones right um I think it's I I'd become too OCD over it and  want to oversee the whole thing personally myself than trust somebody else if I  came into that in the TC was you know what I think I think that these dudes  charging 50 Grand washed all of us I think so I think they brainwash all of us into  telling us that it's too difficult and you can't do it that's what I think I mean  that's so they could charge us the 50 Grand so like personally yourself what do you  think I mean you've done ordering here some wise yeah maristamwise I mean you've  dabbled in it yeah it's it's doable I mean they teach they teach undergrads to do  it all day long it's really just about sterile technique but what would the cost to  put something not just like the Personnel to run it the cost of something to put  something like that together personally with the right equipment you're culturing  plants luckily and so then a lot of the expense and difficulty comes into different  plants are much harder to initiate growth right yeah so it can take years for`

`certain certain species of plants if you've got a meristem could take years  cannabis is not that it's not going to take you years you have to be patient but  there's nothing there's nothing that's actually going to stop you from doing it  like you already possess the skills you just told me how anal you were about your  room we just talked about this beforehand you know we talked about some of the  frustration like you know what you deal with um if you already have those qualities  you're qualified to do it right it's just a matter of following a procedure  following a protocol and that's what it comes having the proper Sops but like some  I'm just talking about like the cost like what would you see the cost in placement  to do something like that five grand five grand I mean how nice would it be if  Athena came out with your own uh mayor stem you know I'm just messing with you no  I'm just messing with you but like that's the thing is that I yeah right yeah  Stoners dude I I think a lot of uh the the problem is is that it gets sold to that  and it's like that and they're like oh well here you need well no you know this  Hood you need this you need this and then also don't forget about all the HEPA  filter Vector you know like yeah they've been terrified everybody's been terrified  because they think that failure is going to be some catastrophic thing so you think  failure failure mostly comes down to you got to throw away some petri dishes right  what what is that at the end of the day that's not a huge failure right then you  try again that just means that your protocol was a little bit off but it's not like  you created more disease right you know you didn't the worst case scenario is just  not that worst case I think is what it comes down to its time without a doubt but  the flip side is you know the risk reward right if you get it right now you have a  clean mother plant that you can take thousands of cuttings off of that you know are  virus free right and what's that worth hey Chris can I ask you a question yeah um  so like in a different industry like you mentioned Tomatoes or let's say leafy  greens or anywhere else are they going to go pay 50 grand for tissue culture are  they going to be like dude you're [Â __Â ] and you're just getting you're you're in  the wrong industry is it like industry to Industry for instance like you can go buy  rock wool grow down rockwool a tomato farmer does not pay what we pay for road at  Rockwell right like I I um there's there's green taxes real right but it is  definitely a real thing so sometimes you know even even when I was getting this  this quote done I did have that moment where I'm like am I just getting treated  like this because I [Â __Â ] grow pot lab equipment all this stuff is everything's  on wildly expensive to some level right um because I always approach things and  never tell people I need anything for cannabis it's just for research um so you're  getting a little bit hosed on that end but what the size and scope is dependent on  the difficulty of the tissue culture right so for something that that's more easily  tissue cultured it's going to be a lot cheaper and then it comes down to was it  developed over years like something like if you're doing like grapes it's a longer  crop and we're not talking about a short-term annual it's going to be a different  thing you're shooting for you know and preserving genetics that are 100 years old  or something it's a different process it might take two years to go from meristem  to plant that's a long time so that is going to be obviously a very different  process and procedure and so it's going to be more expensive if you're talking  about something like tomatoes you can grow diseased tomatoes harvest the seeds  they're and just do seed sterilization technique for most of these things anyway  and then we'll just select the good ones you know like it's it's a different  process so I think it really I told you not to call um so since cannabis is such a  fast-growing plant It's relatively easy to do tissue culture tissue culture at  least from what what I've seen you know and talking with with jungle boys and other  people who do Tish culture and cannabis it is not a challenge you know it's mostly  follow the procedure it's sterile technique now you're back down to sterile  technique and that's something that people can get trained to do you know that  that's it's that simple you know and like I said what's the risk you throw away a  few Petri dishes you know no I hear you I I haven't even tried to think about it on  the side because honestly I get I got more deterred it wasn't the the price it was  the length when I'm talking to people and they're like oh like we can if I'm`

`sending it out they're like oh it's you know six months to a year for you like get  it back right and are you gonna get one plant back or what are they giving you back  I mean I guess that's the real question too that's the whole entire thing you know  and then come with a certification that it's clean that's you know this is where  all these are for that don't you yeah of course and then it might be more months  and then they pay you they uh don't forget about the storage fee the storage yeah  it might take that long if you have primogenetics and you only have one plan and it  is you know it has virus you might take multiple meristem cuttings to get to the  results you want you know that might be a true case if you want to save that  genetic that might be your only last choice so then it might be longer you know  that's that's again that's a risk but it seems worse if you have to Outsource that  and have somebody else do it you know that's obviously more expensive right if you  had your own lab then it's mostly a little bit of time um and then the testing  itself but you're going to be paying if they're cleaning up a plant for you you're  paying for the testing also because it's not like you're getting testing for free  they're going to charge you double yeah because they're to double tax that's the  way it's definitely going to happen so I think I don't know if it's available I bet  people would use it I think a big one too is retaining your your genetic library  because going up to my spot I'm walking through the garden I'm like Hey where's the  where's the sherp head uh we got rid of it low THC tester beautiful plant I'm like  man [Â __Â ] like we should we should have kept that right and it's gone forever  and we don't have it well we could have just done a tissue culture cut and held it  on the shelf for two years and not touched it right right and it would have been  fine man that's sick I don't think about that enough oh because you can because I  may come back teammate teaching numbers and it may not matter in 18 months you're  going [Â __Â ] where's that sherbet yeah she was a banger in every other area you  could be you know say you have a list of customers and everyone's asking for that  sherp head like okay let's bring it back bring it out or if you've got a better  breeding program of course like maybe you want to get that for some crosses like  there are reason to preserve genetics for sure yeah JB does that pretty well with  bringing back stuff like they'll re-run like a genetic they have in the years yeah  I love that when they do yeah genetics forty five hundred four to five hundred oh I  was about to say fortified you got to step your game up they also keep their mouths  yeah they also keep their mouths if you want to have a breeding program you have to  have good ballad from a male yeah I hear you but I mean that's a lot of stock if  it's not in tissue culture it's like I'm just thinking the square footage so it  would take up uh exactly tissue culture it's what two three cloning racks right you  know no it's it's how many pictures can you put in it that by that you know that  wide sure yeah I mean you need somebody to curate the collection for sure you know  but it's not like trying to take more cutting you know you're just maintaining a  population in a totally different fashion and they're sealed nobody's touching the  actual plant so it's not getting re you know affected or infected by disease all  right think about it you know jungle boys does a cross and they did it with a male  and the seeds that came out of that they sold and everyone's just producing some of  the craziest fire from that mail but then they don't have the mail anymore yeah but  now they do because it's all in tissue culture no I hear you and it's you know it's  crazy on some of the varietals that people just like oh we lost that or hey you got  let go or it did that because there's definitely some that like I Let Go 10 years  ago that now I'm just like damn I really wish I had that cut and even though it's a  cop from 10 years ago it doesn't matter it's just like I still you know could have  done something with it and I think that's the other thing what I thought like hash  strains there's a lot of things that people are overlooking on the hash wise yeah  so yeah for sure anytime I want something back I just call Dylan pretty much and  then I just cross I'm just crossing my fingers I'm like [Â __Â ] I hope I'm not  giving out hlb I mean I I swear I talk about HRV more than anything else for sure I  mean I understand I know I know I know it comes a bit you know so now I think the  biggest two benefits are the clean genetics and then storing your genetics for  years without touch I've never thought about that because right now instead of`

`having those 80 I'd have like eight yeah the other 72 I'll be like well I'll bring  them back next year they're sitting on ice this one you don't have to once you've  tested it down and keep cloning your testing program just changed right yeah well  right here and I hate to say this so like okay how is it for testing for you guys  you guys have likes in here in Nevada is it stringent microbial and THC and all  that kind of stuff yeah if you guys visited your testing facilities that you guys  go to like has anybody have you personally visited I haven't personally know okay  so I I visited a couple testing facilities in Michigan right so what they do is on  Monday like you have your Harvest you get it yeah it's all you know you you get  your like 14 day like we do a 14 day hang and then after we do a 14-day hang it's  normally about another like 10 days of trimming and then after that it's like make  sure like while it's getting dropped whatever gets dropped and bucked and trimmed  at that point in time then it just gets like bagged and then it just gets opened  after that with like the terp block bags or whatever it is until the whole entire  Harvest is done the whole entire Harvest is done I just tell by just you know you  have a hydrometer you can do whatever but I feel good to test right that's where I  wanted the moisture content these [Â __Â ] do what I found out is if you go in on  Monday what they do is they plate it first for microbials but they put your  [Â __Â ] in a refrigerator they don't just do like straight like oh here we're  gonna test for THC we're gonna do this we're gonna do that so if you get it on  Monday at the end of the day then put it they and they don't plate it they put it  in let's say they pull it out on Tuesday morning so then whatever moisture content  that you have in there it goes three days four days in there and then they test for  THC maybe on day five so it's sitting in a refrigerator and I was like that's where  you keep my [Â __Â ] weed yeah you know but that's what they have to do for sterile  purposes and I'm like oh [Â __Â ] I was like why don't you just test the THC  content first with the moisture content what do you guys test to see what the  moisture is at and they're like whoa yeah you know I know there's I think there's  too many variables here on the testing Market other things because I was like you  know because they can't manipulate a sample and no one wants someone to manipulate  a sample but when you're talking about a THC percentage like a lot of us do because  even though you really probably love that flower probably yielded gray and it was a  low tester yeah that's the only reason it got X is because it was a low tester um  now let's say you talk to a testing facility and you're like hey I know you can't  manipulate a sample you can't physically like dry your sample down you can't do  that but why can't you have like some crazy D Hues that are inside this room just  drying like you pull your sample out and soon as you do that it's like you know  there's so many different variables that they're that these testing facilities are  doing so there's some testing facilities that are getting crazy high THC percentage  numbers and some that are getting low because they're doing those variables they're  plating it right away as soon as they get to the as soon as they get there they're  doing THC right away and then they're plating it for the microbials for the colony  forming units for it but then there's other facilities that are like oh here we're  going to Plate it and then we're going to leave your [Â __Â ] in the refrigerator  for four days I mean How's that gonna affect your actual potency from it are you  sending out the same sample to two laps simultaneously from time to time just to  kind of oh yeah so like we like those results that pisses me off more than anything  I know I know how bad those are like it's a lot of samples but but here's the  difference here in Michigan the lab comes there and picks the samples so they  physically come there there's no [Â __Â ] on it like you can't just be like oh yep  I'm putting this sample in the bag oh these ones are going like here you go yeah  same one same same here in Nevada there's other states that aren't like that you  send your samples to them oh they just roll it around and Keith and send it on its  way that's but but you get what I'm saying there are 52 right put a little too much  kief on that one yeah you know the that's that's what some states are doing I mean  like I've heard crazy [Â __Â ] from what people are doing you know drying it down  to like six percent moisture kind of time and then like like you said like keeping  it like doing like whatever but then I I ate a homie out in uh OKC they did the`

`exact same thing and he did it dude his whole everything failed for heavy metals  because you have a chance a higher chance of failure because he's like the Wild  Wild West right now down there dude so um yeah I don't know it's it's to let go of  varietals because of certain things like that it's just heartbreaking because it's  like damn that's some some of the best smoke that I've smoked in my life's like 16  17. testing wasn't an issue until like the last couple of years I'm a fan of low  THC weed lower THC weed I like flavor but yeah these days so yeah me too you guys  get me [Â __Â ] ripped and wasted Henry's gonna be here he's gonna get me [Â __Â ]  faced in about one puff everyone's got to keep it I don't know how this is gonna go  you seem to like look what I rolled you you're right it's gonna be a [Â __Â ] ass  joint only no this is a it's a good podcast guys well I appreciate you for uh  having us yeah it's just the beginning we literally just got off planes we're too  [Â __Â ] starving again we're gonna go to uh starving he's super hungry after this  yeah no joke it's gonna be a big week tomorrow's first day of the show a lot of  things dropping we got three things dropping and we're really excited about it  we've been working it on it all year yeah I need a break buddy yeah it's been a  long time don't worry hey you don't know what it is I don't know what it is inside  this makes it all worth it for me though you know yeah this does I think a  confirmation though I just gotta I think I got enough to just have dreams at night  about what it might be for us like just a tip yeah it's it's uh it's cool to do  stuff that's real and that's really genuinely impacting people's lives in a major  way I want to ask you a question before we get done yeah what what's your no it's  not about what's supposed to be released um what is your what's your uh a passion  what's what's your passion behind all this like where where does it come from  behind all this I think because I think I think a lot of people just I think I know  but I think that uh I just I think it's something I want other people to hear where  your passion comes from shopping at a hydro store I think is like 21 22 and getting  Knowledge from the guy working the counter and I go and I put all of my debt on  credit cards to build a 16 hour rent a house move out of my parents you know when I  was like 19 and you know rented a house put myself in a ton of debt on credit cards  because I knew how to build my credit at a young age and saved up all my money to  do this and get advice from the guy behind the counter at the hydro shop and I'm  not saying all hydro shops are like this but you're relying on the information  given by that person right and you go and you put your life on the line and you  throw it all in and flops and you go and you look for more knowledge and flops  again and you just next thing you know I'm 200 000 in debt because I've been  spending money on nutrients and fertilizer and rent and it's housed while trying to  run a small pressure washing business that I you know was I was a pressure washing  and cleaned Windows right that's that was my main business where I made money click  decks and stuff I pressure washed like gas stations nice malls nice yeah I had like  two trucks I'd work from you know I'd start about midnight and get off about three  four in the morning sometimes later just depends go run my hydro shop check in try  to sleep a little bit in the middle of the day do some lights run had some lights  and I just think that from my personal experience losing everything and having to  file bankruptcy because the knowledge I was given and how much I invested into this  grow these different grows and putting it all on the line and just failure after  failure like I don't want anybody to go through that [Â __Â ] and so when so when  we're giving out knowledge as a company I think what drives me and I think you as  well and you our team dude is driving driving other people's success yeah I mean  the reason why I started my Instagram was to go find knowledge you know I was on  the forums back in the day Ivan you know all these guys and um I took this job to  help the next guy you know um it's I was in a lot of these guys shoes you know and  I put out information just just to help people and and that's why I have the  Instagram following I do whether you use it or not whatever but I just like helping  people so that's why I took this job you know and it's been a blessing man yeah it  feels good great company dude there's a lot more important things in life than  money no there's there's time there's it's hard work that's period you know and  passion like the the one thing I love about uh you know working working with this`

`group and and one thing Iris I've always respected because I knew you were going to  say some along along those lines it's and now it now when you just said that story  now I now I know I just instantly thought of Owen he's not here but Owen's story  that he told last year about going to Home Depot and going in debt on a credit card  to build this grow no no I knew because he's like Brandon sent me lights and so I  just all these things that they just make sense to me now about like once you  probably saw in him when you heard his story right because you were there yeah  right you don't want to see anybody else go through what you had to go through and  you don't want to see him go through what you just went through not in the same way  you know what I mean I take time out of my day to try to like for us this this  information this Collective knowledge that we have as a group on people if they  want to accept it because like you don't have to stumble you don't have to fall and  like we'll be here to help you you know and we're gonna and we're gonna put in the  time like even with fade we put in almost a Year's worth of collective stuff behind  it's not just a white bottle that they're going to see in a five gallon jug right  it's like round after round of around we're risking crops we're like we're gonna  [Â __Â ] do this we're gonna make it right we're gonna keep trying you know just  just to put something collaborative collaboratively together you know because we  want we want we want to produce better stuff for for everyone it's [Â __Â ] sick I  think Athena as a whole the villain of the the villain that we're up against is  misinformation yep that's that's what we're fighting damn that's deep I mean like  really when you actually think about that I never really I mean that is it's a  problem a lot of things that I I've personally myself seen and talked with people  that are running certain things they'll message me and I'll answer it I'll be like  hey what's going on and I'll give the time my wife hates it like absolutely hates  it but uh it's I know personally I've changed quite a few people's lives from being  uh because they put in the time to it I I gave them the pieces they put in the time  so not just like oh I change it just from spending like you know I'm talking months  like there's a guy over in Africa right that like this is what he does right so I  actually got some cuts out to him believe it or not and he's like respect yeah  exactly in Africa hey this guy's the Clone plug in Africa now they got you on  recording are they [Â __Â ] right right well hey it's all good there's uh there  were hemp but uh you know like the whole entire that shit's legal I think I mean  that's good anyways something like that yeah but the whole point is is like it  changed his life right I mean the guy's probably trapping like crazy not there but  that he didn't like he had this like uh it like what do you send him a cop huh  would you send them coach fans yeah yeah I'm serious I did that's the highest  testing THC we have right now yeah but it also smashes at the same I mean Greg's  going to be here in a little bit too but um that that one that one smashes on  yields especially and everything the whole point is is like it changed this guy's  life and to be able to do that like where you're just saying I mean I had it where  I mean I got at one point in time I got just a lot to my head and I got robbed to  like 15 units and I needed that money to pay my electrical and then like make my  money that I was gonna make for like everything at that point in time and then I'm  like coming home and I'm like what the [Â __Â ] am I gonna do now like how how am I  gonna hustle in order to like make this like I have like five days and lights are  turned off like how am I gonna put this together like I needed that and then it's  like it happened right yeah so that's just where it comes from so I resonate from  that I mean it's a big thing cultivators have so much adversity if you really think  about I mean which worried about the law how do we pay this electric bill it's too  high do I pay it in cash or credit card trying to find the right place to cultivate  worried about the landlord you know you're worried about HOV all these factors  everything you said actually he just heard hlk so the one thing that you don't want  to worry about is the information that you're getting from the company that you're  buying from for sure that's always been our thing right I mean it's the  disinformation you know I sat here and for me this is how we found each other right  and I want to go back a little bit of that is everybody in this whole company loves  to help people like almost to a fault right we'll all you talk about your wife`

`getting mad I'm sure we've all had that conversation with our significant others  right of like why why now because they need help and now is when they need help  right and but that's just what we do you know I mean that's part of our culture  entirely and why we're all here I want to help and part of that is getting rid of  the misinformation right the BS the 32 bottles all this thing 140 different  greenhouses and research projects and nobody grew a single research plan with any  of that [Â __Â ] zero you formulate across the board and no single scientists  believed they needed any of that BS so turns out you don't need any of that BS and  then you grow fire crops so I you know for me it was frustrating that's what got me  into this is that I just none of it lined up you do actual science do actual  research and it all says you do this and then you would go and look at cannabis  industry and they'd say do all this and it was none of this and I'm like I don't  know what the hell to make of all this and like you know so that's a it's a shock  when you're like I go to the grocery store same thing I'm like what is none of this  works with what's supposed to be done and then it's migrated right and slowly just  keep pushing the same tell the truth give the right information let the grower do  their job and stop fighting them clean simple clean simple nutrients yeah with with  the right information behind it and with proven results and a track record of  testing things you don't have to add all of those things my grandpa used to say  keep it simple stupid yeah it'd be like huh yeah you just call me stupid I think  there's a misinformation too with Athena because I got a lot of people that hit me  up and they think it's like some company I'm like I don't know what other nutrients  you guys have ran this is the easiest thing I've ever done in my life seriously  they're like I don't understand your stacking and I see Max's chart I'm like whoa  let's back up a little bit as far as the you know the feeding chart and the inputs  it is the easiest thing so easy well that's so simple the nutrients are simple and  so that way you can focus on those other pieces that are going to do the work right  nutrients should be simple we help you focus on the plant stacking easy different  cultivation techniques yes that's that's more of the work that we're trying to help  you out right it should be simple on the new friends yeah and that's what we're  trying to bring out there kind of want to talk about Pro and Blended a little bit  too kind of coming off that you know you talk about simple they are simple don't  get me wrong but Blended is simple you know like you can push no runoff heavy  runoff and you're going to see good results Pro you know there's there's a fine  line you could push little no runoff for three days and your EC is high in the  medium which is it's not a bad thing it's a really good thing you know you can  stack like you know heavy Bud sites come stretch doing that so you gotta obviously  play around with it but bro like the stuff itself is it just kills it no matter  what so yeah cool yeah it's gonna be a long week guys yeah right yes sir I'm  excited for it all right appreciate it let's go get some food yeah rock on all  right oh thanks guys`  

`so bro first of all i don't think you get enough respect on your [Â __Â ] name and  what you've done and i'm gonna share just my personal opinions like i don't speak  for [Â __Â ] anyone else but like i think my opinion is very strong and like has a  [Â __Â ] just deep cemented you know place in our industry because of like what  i've gone through and like what i've watched happen from like the hills for those  who don't know like you've been [Â __Â ] building badass [Â __Â ] companies for  cannabis for a very very long time and like you've been in these trenches endlessly  since the very very beginning like myself but like the [Â __Â ] you've done is  [Â __Â ] legendary and like you have a spot in the hall of fame at the very  [Â __Â ] top and i just think it's important for you to hear that from someone like  me thanks bro i really appreciate it like thank you dude from [Â __Â ] air  conditioning days and starting your own company and like the [Â __Â ] mind and the  pivot and a lot of this [Â __Â ] like i talk about and then like at the hardest  time in the [Â __Â ] world to like come into an oversaturated crazy cutthroat`

`thanksgiving you're [Â __Â ] you know december january february like i remember  being like okay this is going to end right like christmas is over no okay new  year's eve in 2018 it just kept going it started in october and it kept going all  the way until like the beginning or the middle of 2019 for sure you know um we're  seeing a bit of a downturn right now you think it's worse than 2018 or about the  same i mean it's definitely worse because way worse it can't they can't be compared  like the way i look at it like 2017 was this terrible wildfire right now we could  technically be talking about like a prehistoric extinction it's a much different  conversation so you're thinking that this could be i don't think i'm thinking like  we're seeing all the [Â __Â ] you know a lot of them like they call them like you  know the the heritage growers and and the homesteaders and everybody in in [Â __Â ]  humble and mendo all these all these places that got licensed where they got like  some garden beds and flowers and they do you know mendo perps and they got all  their their homemade strains that they've made over the years like they're real  real ganja growers you know like and i i i mean no shade on this but like breeders  and different companies and [Â __Â ] you see like mass produced [Â __Â ] in in  central valley and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of seeds and strains and all  this [Â __Â ] like if you just follow the history it goes back to these very unique  people who risked their freedom because they believed in this plant and their  homestead and their family lived off that and and they weren't like doing any  amazing [Â __Â ] or had some special house or car like they barely got by and like  these people a lot of them rolled in and were barely still getting by because  they're like being able to do [Â __Â ] under the table and like it's just gotten  much much much worse the industry's not supporting this kind of flower very few of  them are are doing okay you know and and we're watching we're watching people die  off you know in in like parts of this industry becoming heading towards extinction  yeah that's where i'm going with this and like i don't like it and like i don't i  don't think it's right and i don't think it's [Â __Â ] fair but like what can you  do about it like the world is ran on [Â __Â ] corporations there's barely mom and  pop [Â __Â ] they're like [Â __Â ] just sprinkled sporadically but like every  [Â __Â ] you drive down the freeway here like business after business like  corporations like what defines a company as that like that's what our entire  [Â __Â ] world is based on shame on us for thinking like every little [Â __Â ]  person was gonna get passed through and and gonna make it and stand with these  [Â __Â ] behemoths do you feel it'll bounce back no on pricing [Â __Â ] no you  think the pricey how how low do you think the pricing will get i mean it's like  [Â __Â ] is it's like outdoor is terrible outdoors like 200 a pound you can't give  it away like a month ago dude this [Â __Â ] dude was like all land like for to a  group of people like i just overheard it i'll land a semi truck where you want it  on the arm thousand pounds just tell me where to [Â __Â ] where you want this thing  to be dropped and people are like don't want that you know what i'm saying like  nobody wants that [Â __Â ] my buddy george shaman extracts people are hitting him  up be like dude we'll bring you thousands of pounds of fresh frozen he's dude he  said vans were showing up just like to dump [Â __Â ] off and he's like what the  [Â __Â ] is this and like i never authorized this like send this back no no no just  keep it you can have it like that's [Â __Â ] insane like we're watching [Â __Â ]  die on the vine like [Â __Â ] no it's not gonna get better yeah the difference  between 2018 and the current present time is that we were still able to move weight  for sure in 2018 for sure this is the first time that we've actually seen wait just  sitting there for sure and i think that's that's the major differences no because  like you got more and more people coming online more companies coming online you  ever watch [Â __Â ] shark tank and someone comes in with a great cracker idea or a  [Â __Â ] drink and they're all like oh this tastes good no one wants the [Â __Â ]  deal because they're like how are you gonna get the shelf space it's no different  difference to us you know and then like when you get the shelf space like dude if  you're not like somehow have a following where like people are gonna support you  and [Â __Â ] like dude even if you only had like [Â __Â ] 100 lights selling that  many bags every [Â __Â ] you know 60 days like dude it's tough and then if you want`

`[Â __Â ] not from them nothing that jungle boys did like all the other fees were  just like just depleted my little bit of profit and i'm like okay this is not the  move for me personally how did that happen how did you start working with ivan um i  mean i'm like just everyone else [Â __Â ] love the jungle boys you know what i mean  like i'm older so knowledge was was very you know hard for us to find and back then  it was only forum and i was too nervous to like post and too scared to post and  dude ivan was just like dude i remember like watching him and being so [Â __Â ]  inspired you know and me with hundreds of people like you here all kinds of just  the most amazing people talk about [Â __Â ] ivan you know and like when i obviously  there's a team to all that and [Â __Â ] like that but like i don't i don't know a  lot of those guys but jungle boys as a whole you know like i think of their leader  ivan you know and just like dude he did everything like anything there was to try  to do he did he shared the information you know me i'm extremely passionate about  [Â __Â ] knowledge and sharing and teaching people a lot of people aren't they  don't want [Â __Â ] no one to know anything and don't feel like it was earned and  all this [Â __Â ] and dude he's been like super open and extremely inspiring like  over the years just like watching what he's done and in his artwork in his  packaging and just like everything they do is on a whole [Â __Â ] new level and who  he's inspired i mean i think you can almost name like everybody in our entire  industry and like all the the big people and like instrumental and inspiring  everyone instrumental in in doing it first just and then on top of that having the  burden of fighting just the longest never-ending [Â __Â ] battle you can imagine  you know what i mean like just [Â __Â ] war-torn shield broken down blades broken  blood all over the [Â __Â ] place you're in a a [Â __Â ] battle where there's just  like thousands of dead carcasses all around you and they just keep coming over the  hill and like at like not to fall on your sword and just be exhausted and just  continue to take [Â __Â ] throats and like we've just seen that like look what  happened to them still to this day like unexplainable [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] and like  remember like earlier in this conversation like i just felt like sometimes like  i've had to carry the the just the bearer of being able to handle terrible [Â __Â ]  that happens in this industry and i feel like you know ivan's a really good  [Â __Â ] person and he's super solid and he's had to carry this burden that he  doesn't deserve he's just one of the ones that can carry that [Â __Â ] burden and  is strong enough too so the grow gods have bestowed that terrible [Â __Â ] task  upon him you know what i mean yeah and so like i've just always followed them and  liked them and um everybody was like at that point talking about how dude nobody  can get flower on the shelf and it's impossible and like this [Â __Â ] the system  and dude yeah okay like all that's [Â __Â ] true whoopty do it's always been true  but like i'm tired of hearing it you know what i'm saying like i'm tired of seeing  the same [Â __Â ] again and again so i was dead set on you know what i'm gonna put  my own [Â __Â ] flower out i'm gonna put flour that i grew i'm gonna [Â __Â ] buy  it back i'm gonna select it i'm gonna [Â __Â ] hand trim it i'm gonna design my  bags i'm gonna get it packaged i'm gonna make the [Â __Â ] sale i'm gonna do all  this to prove to myself that it can be done and prove to everyone else there that  you can do it you know what i'm saying like i was hearing enough and enough and  enough like how nothing's possible and all this and so grew out of [Â __Â ] bag  seed that was gifted to me first time like ever kind of you know doing something  like that it was a [Â __Â ] banger and um i had already had this in place but not  knowing like where it was gonna get sold to like we're coming up on like getting it  [Â __Â ] trimmed and [Â __Â ] like that and you know i was like man like i gotta  find you know someone to sell this to and telling my wife this [Â __Â ] and she's  like man do you should bro you're always talking about like the [Â __Â ] jungle  boys and you're always looking at their [Â __Â ] and like you should reach out to  them and i'm like just a stupid ass idea you know like like dude me and my wife`

`people inspire people i'll always do that till the [Â __Â ] day i die yeah just two  weeks ago i went out to michigan and i remember back when i got in the industry  here in southern california i felt like the culture was a bit different way back  then you know just felt it just felt like i was part of a community of cultivators  and we all you know i ran the counter at the hydro shop you know guys came in we  shared knowledge i used to have a keg behind the counter come have a beer just felt  like a real strong community culturally back in you know 2011 12 13 you know coming  up and when i went to michigan a few weeks ago i got to hang out with all these  cultivators and i felt like i was back in socal in 2011 you know just felt just  felt different you know and it was cool it was cool to be there and just go to  dinner with all these guys and and just feel the energy it was it was uh it wasn't  like everybody was trying to like i don't know it just felt good you know i really  enjoyed it and and reminded me of socal quite a few years ago and like socal was  way different than my experience in norcal like what was happening down here was  not happening the same for me up there you know like again we're removed like do  when i went to the hydro store nobody talked you didn't talk to anybody in the  aisles like it was way way different like what you guys were doing here and having  a place to hang and we did not ha i didn't have that i didn't see people hanging  out in the hydro store up north like just different you know and so like i always  wanted that you know especially at that young age where like where you want to  interact with people and you need to have friends and you know like i've always  wanted that kind of thing and like seeing michigan like seeing how they are when i  go out there and seeing how like they [Â __Â ] treat me so good dude and and like  it just there's there's a culture out there that's been missing for like my whole  entire adult life you know like dylan mitten master is one of my best friends and i  [Â __Â ] he's from michigan you know what i mean like i talk to him all the time  we'll talk for an hour on the phone i don't talk to nobody you know what i'm saying  like i'm normally one of those weird people on the phone were like want to get in  and get off you know what i'm saying but like i met him out there i met him through  this like he's one of my best friends yeah dylan's uh dylan's a legend for sure  yeah dylan's special like he literally like when i met dylan and like hung out with  him the very first time like i felt like we were dude long lost brothers like we  were two clans that were like separated when we were four and went on our barbaric  [Â __Â ] ways and and were grew you know grew up in different clans and then like  one day like [Â __Â ] met each other again in the battlefield and we're looking at  each other and just something seemed like there's like this memory like this this  this resurgence like i know this [Â __Â ] person when uh i was i used to run the  tech phones for athena when it first started because we're you know trying to get  these we're changing an industry as far as what they thought about nutrients you  know we're usually a nutrient company would just say hell add this and add that and  do this and do that and it doesn't matter you know so what what we did was just  kind of tailor a program and i remember working with dylan you know on how he was  using it he was using i think a little bit lower of an ec value on the pro line and  and worked with him on on raising the ac ec and then he called the hotline yeah he  caught me that's how we that's how we met so we met through the tech support line  at athena and dylan to further more what you're saying is like when he wants to  know something oh he's all in it yeah he'll figure it out he's like more than very  similar to he's similar to you but in that but on another level like yeah i don't  go to the extent that dylan does no he called me probably several times a day dude  we met each other on a consultation he paid for a consultation and we're talking  about other [Â __Â ] and i'm just like i wrote this dude down i'm like [Â __Â ]  dude i talk to people all the time like there's something about this guy like i  remember writing his name down and circling it you know and yeah we were talking  about dogs and everything else but i'm like dude this dude is [Â __Â ] smart like`

`just the way he articulated his words and always had a response and i'm like okay  i'm gonna remember this name like this guy's special right here yeah he's driven  really drunk extremely yeah bro he feels like like when i watch dylan work it's  different you know what i'm saying like it's like as if he took the oath to the  [Â __Â ] president like when he came to work for athena like this dude works so  [Â __Â ] hard if you are ever at a point where like there's just so many employees  and [Â __Â ] so big he should be the dude that gets played on the jumbo scrawn the  jumbotron for every new employee and is like talking about the fundamentals of  athena and what we stand for and like yeah another level what what made you come to  the athena team because we met through dylan right and that's why i bring it up and  now now we're working together closely on athena what is it about athena that well  the very first thing i planted that seed probably like a year ago like maybe a year  and a half ago now because we've been working together for we've been working  together for half a month but i just remember thinking to myself like dude these  dudes are [Â __Â ] making making waves they're the hit squad like i'd think of  athena's the hit squad you know and i'm in the [Â __Â ] bleachers i'm a dude like  i'm i'm a [Â __Â ] home run king of my own you know i'm on the opposing team yeah  i'm visiting i'm sitting in the bleachers you know there's some camaraderie you  know i know these guys and i'm [Â __Â ] watching watching their watching the squad  at bat and i'm just like damn dude i [Â __Â ] belong on this team like i should be  batting number five six in this lineup you know what i'm saying yeah i'm not gonna  overstep myself and but like i see a spot for me on that [Â __Â ] roster like like  these are my people dylan's on the [Â __Â ] team so i planted that seed being like  okay i'm not gonna be the guy that ever reaches out ever calls you says like yo  brandon like put me on you don't know who the [Â __Â ] i am i'm not gonna ask dylan  i'm just you know what i'm just gonna be organic i'm gonna let this [Â __Â ] thing  unfold how it unfolds but that's where i'm gonna end up like i'm gonna be batting  for this team and i'm gonna be hitting bombs and i was going through starting to  deal with like a lot of self-sabotage [Â __Â ] you know and like i think i think  it's a topic that doesn't get talked about with growers a lot in cultivation and it  happens so fast and it's so redundant we're doing the same [Â __Â ] things every  single day in our life and and sometimes it it just feels like we're stagnant and  like in those moments of stagnation you start doubting yourself and then the moment  you have a problem you really doubt yourself especially when this community holds  you to a higher [Â __Â ] level and oh man i dude i remember that i remember seeing  people's profiles be like oh my god dude can i grow like that like that looks so  sick like jungle boys being like [Â __Â ] dude can will i ever have a bud that  looks like that you know and when things start going wrong and you have all these  people that are relying on you and you're sharing information and you're [Â __Â ]  answering questions like self-sabotage starts sitting in and i was like going  through this thing without kind of really saying anything being like dude i don't i  tell a couple close people like man i don't feel like i feel like i'm losing  whatever skills i had and my [Â __Â ] rooms aren't turning out right and shit's  kind of [Â __Â ] hitting the dust and like the the middle of my runs and and  [Â __Â ] my drippers are always clogged and all this [Â __Â ] [Â __Â ] and i'm just  like going back to the manufacturer and they're like bro isolated problem like we  don't know what to tell you it's you it's your water and i'm like what the [Â __Â ]  dude i got ro water like it's big boy like how much more can i do and dude my my  runs had suffered and i was embarrassed and i've got this [Â __Â ] patreon where  i'm teaching people how to do things and consultations and drawing facilities and  the self-doubt is like starting to set in more than it ever has in this level of my  career you know what i mean and dude by like the [Â __Â ] grace of the grow gods  [Â __Â ] and we talk often but like uh dylan just reached out to me out of the blue  like a little before christmas and he's like bro i need to have a conversation with  you and i was just like yes like i i knew you know what i'm saying like i just  [Â __Â ] knew he just got back from the christmas party he's like bro and i'm  sitting there just [Â __Â ] disgruntled and i've just thrown away a thousand  drippers at this point over the last four days like my soldiers like i'm i'm in`

`several years [Music] got a little tired and lonely up in the hills anyone who  spent enough time up there knows how that goes saw an opportunity in palm springs  my hometown the city was being pretty proactive they were speaking and starting the  dialogue as it relates to licensing obviously all medical at this time so i came  back home to have some conversations with some people i knew and one thing led to  another and my efforts and attention kind of shift um to opening indoors and my  hometown the desert um not too long after that became my focus i linked up with  mike king through a friend of a friend not even a friend but through an  acquaintance and an acquaintance one of those you know seven people removed type of  situations we ended up in the same building had a good conversation realized that  we were both on the same mission to do the same thing he had a financial background  access to capital i had the cultivation and uh cannabis experience and so it was  that minute that this relationship was formed wasn't king's garden or anything at  that time it was just a just a partnership and a common goal so we set out to you  know achieve greatness in the cannabis space it was very quickly after that i had  known tyler um one of the growers i was like consulting for in palm springs tyler  was running successful indoor operations in palm springs we were kind of neighbors  in a sense we ended up in the same building and so uh you know he was one of the  early one of the first people to come onto the team we recognized his skill set and  his value and so you know he was one of the first ones to come onto the team but  yeah that's me in a nutshell no you guys that's awesome to hear that you've come  from the traditional market and and know the background because a lot of the times  you're seeing a lot of people come in um just with capital and and no background so  you're one of the original founders yeah with you you are the original founder  that's me and mike king are the the two original founders yeah that's awesome yeah  and um to your point like there's a ton of people coming into the space that that  you know don't have anything other than capital um they are threat obviously for  their own reasons but at the end of the day um without the ability to grow a good  product and consistently produce um you know just having the capital will never get  you to the finish line 100 but i also think you know you guys have built king's  garden on quality product you know hands down i mean no influencers no you know  crazy partnerships with anybody famous you guys just done it from good quality  cannabis well that was the goal sorry let tyler jump into but that was the goal  originally i recognized that there was this huge misconception that you could not  grow good quality cannabis at scale right this is like a misnomer that's been  thrown around for so long and i saw it when i was up on the hill i saw it when i  lived up there for years and experienced you know what i was a new grower you know  quote unquote uh chatting with people who had been in the hills for 20 30 40 years  and if you asked any of them the general rule or the general consensus was that  there was no way you could ever grow you know good quality cannabis at scale it  just wasn't feasible and i recognize that statement just to be so flawed just and  just on the principle and you don't have to look very far to recognize that like  any agricultural product not any but as far as i'm aware any sort that i've  encountered so far it is scalable yeah is it easy no is there a certain is there a  right and a wrong way to do absolutely but is it scalable like yes absolutely and  that was the mission we set out to prove was that we could in fact you know stay  true to our roots of producing good cannabis not just in a 100 or 200 300 light  facility but in a 3 000 um light operation and growing from there tyler what about  you how did you get into the industry and what's your background yeah so uh i moved  out to california from florida my hometown in 2011. so i just recently broke my 10  years of being in the industry uh i had an opportunity with some family my cousin  was running a you call it on the traditional market at the time a large-scale co-op  i didn't know what i was moving out for at the time who i was going to be working  with what i was going to be doing i just remember my first day walking in the grove  seeing all the the umbrella hid lighting and and uh kind of hopping in first day  right i worked my way from the bottom one thing led to another having to move  getting you know closed down left and right ended up in the desert uh palm springs  like charlie said in the neighboring facility um him and i kind of in the team that`

`he was with kind of shared a lot of the same genetics and tech and just growing  methods and stuff like that so that's kind of how we met timing right place right  time being connected to the right people is how i ended up meeting mike as well and  when they had an opportunity to launch something on the recreational legal side  that's when they called me and joined their team instantly what's your day-to-day  at king's what is your role yes so i'm the head cultivator i oversee all 3 500  flowering lights we have currently 42 employees underneath me every single one of  our facilities has a respective manager on site that i talk with daily weekly  monthly basically sending them templates schedules and things of that nature uh to  keep every facility on track with with our growing methods and to keep everything  on the same cycle so my goal is to look at all 10 of our operations as one facility  right it doesn't matter there's 50 something grow rooms but they're all under one  company and one brand so i have to run those as if it's in one operation right so  we have like a floating team and we use kind of centralizing things as as like kind  of a super power to us right it's how we can remain efficient in a lot of ways so  at standard called a thousand light facility for us only has five full-time  employees on site because there's there's a lot of times that i don't need 15 20  people there but there's you know big harvests or buck downs or green work that  needs to happen you know de-leafing or things of that nature where i have to direct  a large crew you know to one facility or to the next to you know accomplish every  single goal every single week so it's it's a it's a per day and a per week kind of  scheduling that i that i stick to on top of that it's it's you know the the  standard troubleshooting that every grower needs to know how to do how to identify  a product a problem like a mechanical failure things of that nature have the  approach to be able to fix it correctly or know when there's something wrong so so  things like that so i'm on site at every single facility most of the time at least  once a day at every building kind of just driving around now that we're expanding  how many buildings do you have ten so one of them is a is a thank you a uh nursery  uh mother room the other nine are cultivation facilities so all different shapes  and sizes some of our facilities are as small as 220 lights and some of them are as  large as a thousand lights the new ones that we have coming online we have two 2000  light ground up operations being built in palm springs right now and then a 4 000  light operation being built in san bernardino with those things like charlie was  saying you need to find a way to become scalable at an easier cost right so boots  on the ground for somebody like me every single day seven days a week is going to  be a little bit harder so that's when we're going to get a little bit more fine tuned with kind of the mechanical side of things that we're implementing you know  more facility controls irrigation controls fertigation controls where i can tap in  with remote access and kind of guide our team and give them the resources and tools  necessary to be able to succeed yeah right nice um because it's going to be harder  for me to kind of be spread out right yeah charlie you you said you had 3 500  lights going right now what does the expansion look like and how many lights are  you guys have in the plans so yeah 3 500 lights flowering right now all of those  are in the coachella valley um so they're within like let's say a five to ten mile  bubble of each other um the expansion that we're that tyler mentioned right now um  in palm springs kind of an expansion of one of our existing facilities um is an  additional 4 000 lights that's already broken ground the grading has begun um  they're starting to do all the underground now so um and then in addition to that  we have currently under construction um a project in san bernardino that's another  2000 light excuse me 4 000 lights so once san bernardino the palm springs expansion  comes on there's an additional 8 000 it's gonna add to the 3500 that we have right  now so we'll be at 11.5 holy [Â __Â ] a lot of lights and so that's why you know to  tyler's point when you ask him what he does it's everything but i think like the  biggest thing so obviously sops are what allow you to scale right so having very  very very strict and concise and clear sops so that everybody knows exactly what  they do when they do it right we're not trying to um we don't we don't hire like  for quote unquote seasoned like master growers right we hire people who um fit the  the kind of family vibe that we got going on and who are trainable and smart enough`

`to understand like this is how we do things this is why we do it is there more than  one way to do things absolutely right but this is our way and we have to stay true  to our way these are the sops that we've written this is what has allowed us to  scale this will be our success is dependent on following those sops so once you  have those sops and they're so clear and they're so concise it's the it's the rinse  and repeat right rinse and repeat rinse and repeat so what tyler has done just  phenomenally which is probably one of the actual hardest tasks to do is effectively  just schedule and manage what's happening on what days we know that it you know at  this point we d-leaf we know that at this point we um you know clone we know that  at this point but making sure that that's what's happening when you actually have  that many facilities going on and using that floating crew that's our kind of um  like migrant workforce that just moves from facility to facility making sure that  they're at the right place at the right day doing the right task like the  scheduling is really has to be like precise right absolute precision and so that's  a big big big part of what he does he's the head cultivator so he's responsible for  you know everything as it relates to cultivation including like getting these  workers to the right place and getting them doing the right tasks and that's not  that's not easy no and then it with those sops and the foundation that you guys  created i'm assuming you guys have the ability to kind of bring you know talent up  through your through your your operations and you're you're you're you're  developing people based on knowledge that you've learned so instead of hiring like  a guy that been growing weed for you know 10 20 years or whatever you're able to  take a brand new guy and kind of move them through the ranks yeah we do we do that  most of our managers are people who all of them really are people who have started  at lower positions and move their way up and some of the best workers that we have  in the organization period like um packaging managers and trimming managers and  stuff like that are people who started at the most entry-level position either in  packaging or in trimming or in the cultivation team just doing you know the  floating crew work um so everybody has a shot right um show your worth show your  ability to just follow basic you know workflow stuff and you definitely have and  with all of the expansion that's coming in you know tyler reiterates that to these  guys all the time like there's a lot of management positions opening up there's a  lot of uh you know vertical movement that can happen here shortly as these new  facilities come on so do your duty and nice tyler i'm assuming you you're the one  developing these these people what do you look for in someone what qualities do you  look for in someone as you're as you're bringing them up through the ranks yeah  that's a good question uh to charlie's point like we hire everybody entry level  right so nobody really in the company besides myself and a few others which i think  i just got lucky because you know to charlie's point we're not hiring people that  are skilled cultivators already right because we want to be able to groom them to  do things the way that we like to do them not saying that it's the only way or the  right way it's the way that works for us and for us there's no we don't want you  testing out things in our facilities right so i'd almost rather have somebody with  little to no experience that i can groom and what we're looking for is family  values right we're very big on that uh we need to be able to work well together we  need to be able to get along and you need to be able to take direction and follow  notes and like what i'm doing on the back end of things is i'm trying to give the  growers and the buildings as much data and like scheduling as i possibly can so i'm  not looking at myself as the train anymore right i'm not i can't physically be in  there operating dosatrons or irrigation skids and things of that nature i can't do  it anymore i look at myself more as like the train tracks right i'm trying to guide  everybody to success but just like here is our way of doing it right now with the  big change of implementing athena and all of that stuff you know everything's kind  of changed we've had to switch sops and that stuff but only to our benefit yeah  alex how did you you worked with these guys i mean to make not you guys don't make  a lot of changes and i respect that and i i'm all about that but to make a change  from how many bottles were you guys using before 16 different bottles at one time  yeah eight at one time yeah not at once obviously but like through this growing`

`cycle yeah and that was a dumb down like that was what i had come up with to be  more simple than some of these you know full lines that we were seeing right like  we've tried it all i've i've i've run i've tried the full line of advance and  connoisseur this and i mean we tried it all we've always wanted thank you guys for  finally doing it we've always wanted you know a more basic and simple way and i  knew i i guess i probably left out i did for a small period when i moved to orange  county um i was working at a nursery and i got kind of plugged into the um that  world the agriculture the agriculture side of things and um i learned a lot there  that kind of you know transferred over obviously um but one of the things i picked  up on pretty quickly was that we were all being misled at well just we were all  being taken advantage of not necessarily misled but taken advantage of um by these  nutrient companies right um the idea that somebody finally formulated something  that was you know for for cannabis and so we had to use this or that and if you  understood npk's and and what just those just alone if you understood what those  three numbers meant you you already were off to a better start and then if you  understood you know the idea that there's only so many ingredients to make those  numbers up and there's only so many source sources for these ingredients and stuff  to begin with you started to recognize that like you know this there was way too  many products being marketed just for the sole purpose of exploiting us from our  from our funds yep and so um i tried it all i tried veg bloom when that was you  know like a thing early on um in hopes that like finally somebody mastered this  salt thing right um so we always knew that like or i always knew deep down that  somebody would be able to figure out something that was more basic but that 16  bottle system was was dumbed down right that was like leaving out a lot of the  other rubbish it was like you know what we believed was important in those times  our beneficials our base our beneficials some boosters and stuff like that um some  silica like it was it was all the things that we had been trained to think that  that was what we needed so anyways that's a i guess a thank you to you guys thank  you to alex over here yeah you know just you know just here trying to you know  steer them in the right direction and make it simple i mean that's that's really  what it is is simplifying the whole process at scale that's that's what it is so  our trial run was small right we didn't to your point we don't we don't just dive  right in and make changes um it was a slow process it's been two years yeah but i  don't think the truth is the trial run didn't go perfectly the first time right  tyler no you know what um so to charlie's point you know he did a really good job  formulating our original recipe by taking like all of his favorite products from  all these different brands right so whether it be botanica or house and garden this  and that it was a plethora of other things it got us to where we were at today  could we have continued to scale with that and produce what we were doing with that  sure um but was it it wouldn't have been scalable at an easy cost by any means um  that many changes throughout the plant's life pulling this out and that a lot of  moving parts a lot of moving parts a lot of different doser stations now you're  talking about you know single source basilious with with like uh beneficial  bacterias and then feeding them sugars now we're in the world where we have to  recollect all of our water and strip it of everything and reuse it so that became a  huge learning curve for us cleanliness is a huge part of your guys skill yeah for  sure every scale you have to have 100 sterile so we were successful with what we  had but but you know the first day a good friend of ours chris lundgren uh great  friend of ours we do a lot of stuff together dosatron chris everybody knows about  uh nothing by he said hey he actually just called me around this podcast oh yeah  that's funny shout out chris yeah yeah um he called me one day said hey i got a  couple buddies in town i think rob was supposed to be there but he couldn't make it  but but uh brent and alex i just want you to meet these guys right and so they came  by the shop and immediately alex was like you got calm deficiencies right damn alex  just like that bro just going to start talking about it you know i see what i see  and you know it's easy but but that day you know we sat down in the office and  recognized and charlie you know put this really well when having this conversation  was uh we're not really open to changing much but if we're gonna test those waters`

`with anybody it's gonna be with you guys right because you guys put in the work on  the back end with the with the r d uh specific to what we're trying to accomplish  here right it's not another nutrient bottle that's just like hey buy all these  things you're gonna get thirty percent more and yada yada which is like when has  that ever been true right how many claims have we heard like yeah right increases  yield by twenty percent yeah all day [Laughter] well the conversation that that was  had was even if we could produce the exact same thing with what we were doing  before yep you're winning we're winning yeah and or if we can get close and and  pick up on efficiencies or be scalable at an easier cost to have less bull crap  down the line then it's worth it right our first run was by no means a failure  definitely was a huge learning curve for us because of the you know trying to build  up and in the way that we irrigate and things of that nature we might be a little  unique uh but it wasn't a failure by any means adjustments needed to be made and  now we're at a point right now where i can confidently say we haven't even unlocked  the full potential of what we can be doing with these products but again it's a  long time in the making right we've got a uh already a workhorse of a brand out  there that we need to be cons consistently producing the same product and or better  so we can't just like hey let's rip everything out and change everything overnight  so it was slow r d process but now you know we came to a point where it was like  find something that's kind of like your base that you that i can roll out  everywhere right now right and it's it's something that plays well with everything  every single one of our genetics every single unique difference and maybe each grow  room it works well with everything and we're producing the same and or better with  what we were doing before it numbers don't lie right numbers terpenes all of those  things if success is measured on like if if we went into it with the idea like  tyler said like if we just match what we were doing and b but it was more efficient  to get there it was easier for us to get there then that was a success like that  was that was the the openness that we had right the reality is an increase in  yields an increase in um quality at least certainly with specific strains and  things like that um so i think we can say that you know we we definitely hit that  part of you know getting that or or better and and better would be you know where i  say we landed so much so that we have gone ahead we are 100 transitioned now so the  whole 3 500 lights has made that transition alex's point it was a long you know two  years to get there um but we had we had to make sure that um you know we were doing  the right thing once you got to a certain once we had a certain level of confidence  it was just a matter of actually getting it it was a matter of like getting it  through you know uh rso getting it through the the whole rest of the facilities and  stuff like that it just took time right yeah but um we're very very happy with  where where we're at um and the same thing applies to the deluxe side of things  right like i just like i always wanted there to be a better nutrient solution i we  i think tyler and i also agreed we always wanted there to be a better lighting  solution um you know we grew under everything that you guys have all experienced  right we're on parabolics we ran magnum air-cooled hoods um eventually ran you know  double-ended hids which still are hanging in a lot of our facilities obviously um  but we always hoped that something would come out that would reduce the electrical  demand and additionally reduce the heat load um we tried random things like those  satellite ufo uh leds leds right just little bits here and there never through you  know whole room or whole facilities into r d but definitely like open to the idea  that some light was gonna come out and finally you know disrupt what we knew so  just like with the athena side the deluxe side effectively did that we put it into  an r d with the 645s and um and then i think we were one of the lucky few to start  to yeah you were one sample some of your 860s yeah you steezy and jungle boys all  got rooms at 860's and we're absolutely loving those things right tyler can speak  on details of those but so it's another example of like um you know us knowing that  or hoping and and praying that something would you know it would be a solution and  and there is what do you tyler what are you seeing with leds over the hps and on  all the new builds are you guys going all led now and getting away from hps  completely yeah good question uh everything that we're doing moving forward even`

`like additional rooms in some of our existing facilities that we're currently  building out led 860 watt extra red spectrum leds um first run on those without  having adapted to any learning curves and things like that in an existing grow room  that was operational for four years that we had data going back on with hid  lighting um you know i think i shared this information with alex is with our old  lights and our old nutrients we produced x grams per square foot pounds per light  implemented athena we watched that ticker kind of go up and then went basically  light for light with that same recipe with the athena and with the 860s and we  watched it just go up even more but what was interesting with that was the the  learning curve was minimal granted i'm still learning here um and i've had a lot of  good people like brant and roach and a couple guys like that that have given me  some pointers and some things that that i've seen kind of differently room control  is definitely a lot easier maybe because of the fact i'm coming in at you know  point six tons per per watt or per light right per thousand watts that was our  calculation previously yeah for sure um so i've got i've got full capabilities of  doing whatever we want in that room uh but but just when you talk about like light  penetration and actual like light absorbed by the plant that's beneficial when  you're running an hbs if you there's you used this term yesterday uh yield dilution  there's a point where you could produce too much plant matter in a room or like man  these things are booming they're huge they look good but at a certain point there's  kind of diminishing return on quality with that we didn't see that as much with the  led not only did we have more product out of the room it was better quality top to  bottom just maybe the light penetration the bottoms filled out more we saw more  color throughout terpene production was higher we had test results proving that  terpene production was higher than the hid room so it was a success across the  board so all 12 000 lights that were uh or sorry 8 000 lights that we're designing  right now is all designed with 860 watt leds yeah i learned about yield dilution  from morgan patterson and it's an actual you know verb you know word in agriculture  and i think the two things that are going to affect the quality of cannabis uh  regarding yield dilution is what one ppfd too much ppfd too much light and then two  is the whole crop steering you know the advice that some companies are giving on  crop steering you know we don't like saying crop steering we say irrigation  strategy and when you pump when you pump the ec too high and you're you're driving  your drybacks way too much yeah your yield goes crazy right and you pump you know  high ppfd on the canopy your yield goes crazy but yield dilution terps and thc goes  down you know i think we've always used the term i like that term we've diminishing  returns right it's a similar similar like concept right more is not always better  better better i mean um did you going from the 15 part recipe that you guys were  using um you can be 100 honest did you see a negative impact on quality going from  15 parts organics organic inputs all these different microbes mycorrhizae  trichoderma sweeteners all this stuff to a two-part athena with cleanse 100 honesty  did you see a negative impact on terp testing thc testing bag appeal it got better  it got better yeah it got better on top of other things that you're not mentioning  like cleanliness right which that in and of itself is huge right so we've had  because we used beneficials so much tyler mentioned we have a couple of our  facilities they're on we've kind of dubbed these zero waste facilities but  ultimately what they are is they've got wastewater skids reclaimed skids and we're  treating all the water and and reusing it and not only like the impact that it has  on that reclaim skid but obviously all of the irrigation components the pe pipe and  the emitters themselves any piece of pvc so just the cleanliness side alone right  huge huge huge advantage the ease right so now instead of to your part the 15  things it's the two things like so the ease makes us more efficient which has a  huge huge huge you know benefit to it um and then to your point that i think you  were originally asking the quality of the finished product yeah that's what thc  terpene nug size bag appeal uh you know smell all that which obviously goes with  terpenes has been on point it's we're we're killing it um you know we've always  been proud of the product we produced so it's not not to say that like you know we  were growing [Â __Â ] product and now it's amazing or anything like we've always`

`been proud of it but no you've always guys but you guys definitely like looking at  this stuff and saying wow like there's some examples of some of this uh recent  harvest and recent batches being like just phenomenal some of the best stuff that  we've ever grown so awesome dude yeah i'd like to tackle that a little bit um i  think the concept behind it too for us what's most important is yeah you want to  talk about grams per square foot pounds per light all of these those are all great  right but for us it needs to be a consistent product that hits the shelf every  single time so take an example our gelato it's one of our staples in our in our  grow that gelato needs to be the same every single time a consumer buys it and  opens it with the method that we were using before it was kind of like a like a  stress based recipe right you're adding certain ingredients at certain times you're  taking them away at certain times you're trying to play this game with you know a  give and take throughout the eight week cycle with 100 different genetics right the  concept behind something that's like athena that it's just an extremely stable  well-balanced diet that you give your plant all the food that it needs and it's  going to take what it needs when it needs it you're not stripping your plant at  certain times of things where it's like hey i kind of still wanted a little bit  more of that you know what i mean where you go in a room where there's 10 different  strains growing in 150 light room and you're like well this one's got a little bit  of calmag deficiency to alex's point but for us it was it needed to be super  streamlined for what we were using and it had to be cookie cutter we couldn't treat  things differently within especially within the same grow rooms because of just  scalability right yeah so if one strain needed a little bit of something else for a  little bit longer like hey is the end result of that genetic gonna be good at the  end of the day with what we're running with it if not it's just not gonna make the  cut with with our program right what we're seeing with something like athena is  it's a lot more well-rounded because granted you need to you know still plant  things accordingly by zone or by room because certain strains or genetics are not  going to eat the same but you're giving everything the same well-balanced diet  that's more than enough for what it needs uh to thrive off of and i think that's  the concept there for us with what matters the most is that it's it's just very  stable in in balance right and that allows us to bring certain strains back into  the mix that maybe didn't do so well um under the you know previous um lineups so  yeah the ability you know there's there's a lot of strains that we would love to  grow that just don't fit our model because they're too long of flowering is now the  primary reason previously it did we did have certain things that like well this you  know this was a little too finicky and it would require you know a little more  nitrogen and we didn't have the ability to feed a special blend to adjust these  when everything else they all needed to eat the same and so you'd pull certain  things and strains that we knew we'd love strains that i grew up growing right even  like some of the hazes and stuff like that and and um now this in theory minus the  you know we still have the constraint by the time right we we have a really strict  business model and scheduling like we kind of talked about earlier and as such um  you know some of the longer or none of the longer strains really work for us some  of them obviously can be manipulated into finishing you know in a shorter period  but a lot of things that we would love to grow just don't work when you only have  eight or nine weeks to flower yeah and it really makes sense too you know like  going from a 8 to 16 part and really relying on the nutrient side and changing that  bumping it up taking it out um now it's it's it's like we flatlined it it's  flatlined and we're not relying on a band-aid or an additive it's just flatline and  really falling back on the genetic and letting the genetic do what it's supposed to  do and what that makeup is and having it fit in the staple if it doesn't you know  that's you know that's why we're final hunting you guys i know you guys have that  going but it's it's it's like taking the back seat to where we don't have to find a  band-aid it's it's it makes the end user's job extremely easy um which is exciting  and like you said to tyler's point like you guys have you know the athena line  under your belt it's fully running on 3 500 lights and you know the exciting part  for me is he's like it's we haven't even unleashed what we feel the potential of`

`this model is um on a two-part which again is exciting to you know get up to you  know over 10 000 likes is it's gonna be you definitely have to be willing to like  you know listen to you alex and and listen to the facility advisors and be willing  to kind of let go of some of these things that you know especially as it relates to  the stacking and the these high numbers when people start throwing around some of  these ecs that previously people will be like [Â __Â ] no what are you talking  about right but then when you understand like i i i'd like to think that we're all  intelligent enough like tell me why talk me through it there's a logic you have to  be able to explain it and you guys can actually do that and when you do you're like  ah it makes right it makes sense right so now i'm like okay right but you  definitely have a willingness to you have to have a willingness to like kind of let  go of some of those things and that goes back to like i said before like i'm now i  guess i'm kind of that person i talked about on the hill where you're like oh  [Â __Â ] no you can't do that you can't right and um tyler's gonna implement a lot  more um you know kind of remote accessibility at least for viewing but even  probably for controls um than we've ever set up because we're setting up in san  bernardino and we're setting up and there's so many and so that's another example  of me having to like let my guard down and be like you know yeah the systems are  now proven to work and there's things out there that we know can actually do it but  you know you come i like redundancies and i like like mechanical things as opposed  to like so yeah um there's definitely a you know you need to be you need to be able  to i guess change grow with the times on the uh you were you were going over the  filtration system you guys were reclaiming your water i've heard of this right i  mean what do you think the percentage of facilities i mean is it a california  regulation right now are they you have to reclaim water or you guys are just ahead  of the times we're ahead not 100 by choice our two largest facilities are on septic  tanks we're not tied to the sewer uh but it's kind of a blessing in disguise that  that this happened to us and that we that we took this route uh because it is going  to become mandatory i think what is it 23 well it's another example you have i  think you have state legislation you have municipalities and water boards and all  have varying degrees of like what they want to see done um so [Music] as an example  in cathedral city right like they're they're making it they're implementing um you  know an ordinance that requires that no ice water be discharged to the sewers so  effectively everyone will have to figure out somehow to either haul off site or  treat is that a city ordinance and that's a city right that's that's that's an  example of a municipality who's decided something but then you also have the have  the authority and the regulations of the water boards so in palm springs we have  two different water agencies the desert water agency is our water provider for some  of our facilities and coachella valley water district is a provider for some of the  others and they have varying degrees of what they want to see but i think it's safe  to assume right so one we have this we have the ability to do it now we've proven  that we can so i think we have some obligations to be good stewards to our land and  our resources um but i also think that you know you're going to see a lot more  regulation come down the pipes as it relates to that stuff and so we're kind of  just one step ahead yeah and we've worked with some really cool people along the  way to figure these technologies out and we're working with even you know better  people now um to help specifically figure these issues out hydrologic has a skid  just for water reclamation right tyler can tell you all about yeah i want to talk  about it just because this is something that you know cultivators in california  you're gonna have to pay attention to don't you think oh yeah yep great point uh  hydrologic makes this good that's what we currently use at any of our sites we  currently have three operations that we use hydrologic reclaim skids so basically  how it works is all the leech water from our our table runoff which is 15 20 plant  runoff right and then you've got other things waste from you know switching recipes  on a dose or things of that nature that's just going to go down the drain on top of  that you have the waste of the city water skid with the the concentrate that that's  going to put off is also collected into uh the weight the head waste tank so it's  going to kind of dilute your tds a little bit with with the waste of the uh the`

`concentrate of the city water excuse me the rose city aro skid it runs through a  set of a bunch of different things a chlorine injector which will strip the iron  out of the water we also use that measuring millivolts on orp to kind of try to  disinfect to charlie's point earlier on our old lines feeding sugars and beneficial  bacterias right it was hard to combat the biofilm that came in that high tds water  what were you seeing were you getting more wastewater with more organics or is just  harder to get that orp up in your treatment uh both it was it was hard to get the  orp in the treatment and it was harder to uh prevent biofilm from from popping up  in our in our permeate tanks on our product inks it basically inhibited the the  wastewater skid from effectively doing its job yeah right it puts so much burden on  the wastewater skid that hydrologic scale all of a sudden is like whoa yeah right  so talk about membranes and and all that stuff just high high high high maintenance  at that point yeah runs through a green sand filter carbon filter and then a set of  high tds membrane so just an advanced ro membrane bringing stripping all of the  nutrients and minerals that we've just added to the water fed our fed to our plants  went through the plant stripping it back out for reuse close to zero ppm on top of  that we collect all of our condensate water we're in the desert it gets to 120 in  the summer our acs run like workhorses we collect a lot of condensate water i'd say  about 40 50 percent of our actual water use comes alone from our condensate water  which is dehumidified so a lot of storage for those you guys saw the water room  right there's 15 000 gallons of storage alone in a 1 000 like facility so you do  the math on how much we're going to need yeah with scaling that's a lot of space  that it takes uh but but reusing condensate water is pretty easy we like to ozonate  the water just to get those orp levels up condensate water could be kind of gross  right so we want to disinfect it get those levels of orp up a little bit higher run  it through a hydrologic makes another great product uh it's called the arc scadia  and that just treats all the condensate but that's a zero waste there's no it  treats one hundred percent it treats basically other than just like membrane back  flushes which again that will end up in your waste tank for to go through the  reclaim skid so you kind of get to milk that for what it's worth anyways uh it's as  close to 100 as you're going to get on on condensate reusage well that condensates  pretty clean to begin with right yeah yeah of course could have pathogens  especially depending on if you've ever looked in the condensate lines of an hvac  unit like you tend to see what grows on those things so we're treating it not for  tds or ec but obviously for pathogens and things like that so uv and ozone um but  you're also having a treatment plant come pick up water yeah so the sorry uh the  discharge off of the reclaim skid it's about a two to one or a three to one on any  given day right where uh it'll give you three gallons of discharge which needs to  be hauled off site and or evaporated at the time the evaporators were not whether  economically uh useful to us or not allowed or just didn't fit the space that we  had uh so we just put a tank there where once a week a third-party company will  come and and pick up our water and they'll do what they need to do with that just  so they can dump it whatever it is they do with that is that is that expensive no  yes at scale it is uh but it's definitely less expensive than a lot of these people  hauling 100 of their waste water whether it be the municipality not allowing them  to dump anything down the drain and or uh not having the experience like we do of  actually successfully reclaiming that water for reuse there's a high capital  expense associated with buying a hydrologic wastewater skid yeah i mean they're not  cheap right we're talking six figures to start oh really for something that's going  to process the volume of the water that we're after yeah absolutely yep yeah so uh  there is a return on your investment for buying that and not hauling all of your  water but some people just can't can't do that up front you guys are doing some  some final hunting how many seat pops do you have going on right now and who what  what uh breeders are you are you popping right now yeah so i'll touch on that uh  we're we're in a pretty you know high demand market right now for very specific  things california is the most connoisseur based customer in the whole entire world  right it's the biggest wheat economy in the world uh so people like what they like  and they want a high variety of very exotic things so uh we've got 125 just off top`

`125 different phenotypes um being tested right now um kind of scattered around done  strategically right we're not just going to fill 100 light rooms with all these  different seeds and things that we don't know how they're going to do right so  biting off little batches at a time but about 125 different phenos kind of in the  works right now some of the breeders that we're working with for some of these are  in my opinion and i think charlie can agree some like the best breeders in the  industry right now uh you know compound genetics we're looking for stability right  when we're looking for a good genetic we want something that you know somebody  might produce something that's super fire for a couple of runs but then all of a  sudden just something goes left or right and it's like well why isn't this the same  product right and for us that's important it's got to be consistent so compound  genetics um they're they're doing a lot of cool things right now yeah seed junkie's  another cool one and then we've got a lot of old school things too that we're kind  of throwing back in the mix from seeds that we've gathered over the years that we  just had sitting in a safe for a long time where like hey let's bring these out and  finally yeah finally yeah well now now's the time he touched on it and you guys are  all aware right now this market is the cr i've been doing this a long long time i  know most of us in this room have been doing this a long time this has got to be  the most volatile um you know marketplace for finished cannabis goods that i've  ever experienced it's just insane and so um obviously you know you got to give  yourself any competitive advantage you can quality is an easy way to do that not  easy to get to quality but if you have the quality it's that's a that's step one  yeah it's step one right um and so we've seen more and and i'm i guess i'm probably  guilty of this um i we waited a little too long to start some of these things  because i'm recognizing now like like the demand for just new and ever-changing and  you know we hopped on the wrench train but we probably got there like a little  later than we should have so we're still doing runs and runs is great people you  know but like um hopping on the jealousy train um but we're gonna do a better job  of being earlier to it um but part of that goes back to the whole idea that these  sops are so strict and so like precise and and already existing that you know we we  did what works for us so where we slip behind a little bit there most certainly  i'll be the first to admit it was with a little bit of that genetics stuff but we  are well underway with a hundred plus new flavors coming this year now nice the  biggest i'm on week seven right now right starting week seven this week for a lot  of our new new stuff so the bigger the ship the harder the turn i use that the  analogy it's like making a u-turn and a cruise ship right like i can do what we  need to do to guide us but like i can't do it like you know pivot just 90 degrees  and one at what it takes us a minute right we implement something it starts with  because tyler and i talking it through and then where are we going to start and  how's it going to roll down again it's not all one building or one facility were  spread out all over so just figuring out like the like rolling out athena it's not  just like okay turn on the lights tomorrow and athena's on right we gotta look at  scheduling and when are we harvesting here and when's the right time to like you  know so yeah it's harder the bigger you are the harder it is well also i think our  smallest harvest is right around 100 light mark right so it's like okay you want to  roll the dice with something on r d we haven't really been big because we had proof  of concept going into this right we we rolled this out with with in and with  charlie's formula and his proof of concept and it's like this is the way that we're  designing these things and we're doing them um so we kind of shot ourselves in the  foot a little bit and like the r d side of things where it's like we didn't give us  much room uh to kind of test things without because you're not going to feed  different things in one room right now you got to make the change and now you're  talking 100 lights where it's like let's roll the dice here and there's there's big  money right 100 lights on our lights um but to kind of touch on the last thing too  to charlie's point um it was one of those things where it's not broken don't fix it  right um so we grew a lot of you know we might be a little bit behind on some of  these things but looking into the future it's like okay with what we have right now  12 000 lights you know is that could are the consumers gonna want triple the amount`

`of the same things that we have now right probably not right so we need to expand  our variety uh just for the sake of our expansion because you're tripling the  amount of the same genetics that you have so that's why we're we're going all out  right now because we're kingsguard man right we don't do anything half-assed we're  to do it extreme and now's the time like everybody's operating under the same  guidelines right now everybody's switching to other like the leds are a thing now  right so everybody's using the leds or if they're not they're using the same hid  lighting as everybody else everybody is hopefully people are starting to move  towards that you know moving towards salt lines or clean lines and stuff like that  so if you put everybody in the same pool and everybody's gonna grow the same what's  gonna set you apart one it's gonna be your sops it's gonna be your troubleshooting  skills and how to identify problems as they happen or before they happen to try to  prevent those things your ipm game uh and then your your genetic demand right like  those are the things that's really going to set you apart so that's why then your  costs and your cogs yeah your cogs yeah um so that's why we're doing you know so  many at once it's like okay well if you're gonna do something now is the time to do  something drastic and and you know we're gonna do it strategically we're gonna roll  this out uh to where we're not gonna shoot ourselves in the foot and it's the end  result for us is going to be good yeah yeah just not taking you know rolling the  dice in this time of the market it's it it's scary can't do that no it's just don't  have time i mean especially with like you're saying charlie like just the market is  so educated um they and they always want something new like every week and it takes  us you know a quarter to to roll out something new that is proven consistent stable  you know that we could throw in the lineup yep so it's you know we're you guys are  fighting uh you know it's time you know and then it's especially frustrating when  these trends are fads and not all of them are there's plenty of like really good we  mentioned a few like the breeders and stuff that we that we love working with and  that have you know but when a trend or a fad is born out of like some influencer or  rapper or something like saying something on a song or doing something and then  that becomes the trend it's it's beyond frustrating for somebody in in our position  to be like well first of all why the hell is what so-and-so has to say you have any  influence and now why do i have to pivot to you know based on what he said yeah  yeah so like at least i respect it when it's coming from you know the people that  you that we all have our own people that we know we respect and whether it's a  breeder or even an infant whatever but if it's coming from certain people you  you'll react a certain way it comes from somebody else and it seems to rub you a  different way yeah you kind of have to try to like to charlie's point too like if  you're trying to chase things and trying to trace trends and stuff like that  imagine for a large scale operator like us 3 500 lights right now uh how long do  you think it takes for us to get one seed to market at scale after r d and making  sure that it fits in our sops and our formulas and our growing methods okay this is  the one or two whatever that we selected it takes almost a year for us to actually  get that to market at scale right so it's like at that point is that genetic here  for this is it here to stay right within the market that's why we're late sometimes  yeah you know we were on it when it came out and you all wanted it but it kind of  ship has sailed right so there's a few staples that definitely haven't gone  anywhere that have stood the test of time and you know those are the things that  we're after things that have a little more longevity behind them because they're  truly good genetics that people want so upping a variety with those is kind of the  goal right now yeah it's vital you always have to be popping you always have to be  popping beans do you guys have any uh storefronts are you guys planning on doing  any storefronts retail's never been our thing right so i told you i i started a  retail in westminster california in 2003 um it was called the rancho collective  right back in the days of everything just being an acronym trc the rancho  collective where what casa mesa no uh westminster west manor westminster yeah  westminster boulevard corner westminster rancho uh so i got a little experience  there specific to cannabis retail and i had some retail experience like in the  nursery side and stuff like that i recognized pretty early on i'm not the person`

`that wants to be doing real retail um i'm not a great forward-facing you know this  whole idea that the customer is always right has been [Â __Â ] to me forever i'm  like no there's some customers that are like wrong and like i want to be the one to  tell them that they're wrong but i can't supposedly apparently so um so no it was  very clear early on that like retail is just a headache right it's a huge huge huge  headache but more importantly like than it just being a headache i recognized like  you know the value so i you know if kind of step back and assess you know the  situation this is again going back you know 20 years ago the the person who was  gonna be you know better off from my perspective after doing my like thorough  evaluation was the cultivator right there was lots of retails that we could go shop  our product to we always of course had the traditional patient side you know that  we could go to there was lit very little interaction with um you know people to  begin with and definitely had the ability you know to disguise and kind of again  you got to think of like the time that we were in right and um trying to be kind of  behind the behind the scenes i give a lot of credit to the people who were early  adopters like jungle boys of early adopters of like they've been doing this for a  long long time they're not new they're legacy guys but they jumped in and said like  we're gonna kind of show you what we're doing um long before a lot of those people  like we're willing to do that right myself included so um my partner mike wanted to  put um i remember years ago the conversation came up we're building these beautiful  buildings they have these state-of-the-art cultivation facilities and he's like i  want i want a big old illuminated king's garden sign on the side of the building  something you can see from the tin freeway and i'm just like oh [Â __Â ] right this  is a thousand light grow you want to mark it with a king's garden logo on it so  i've just come from that era where like we don't like no way right flash forward to  now every one of our buildings has a big old logo on it we're proud as hell of it  um i'm so glad that he convinced me to like that that was the right decision but um  yeah coming from an era where like we didn't want to put ourselves out there quite  as much right not coming from a new kudos to all those who did oh for sure you know  coming from an era where you know you're out at a bar you're with your homies and  everyone's asking oh what do you do for a living construction yeah and it was true  that construction was a very big part of what we were doing anyone who was setting  up grows and stuff i mean like you know you basically became an electrician and you  basically became a mechanical engineer and learned hvac and stuff like that because  you were you didn't have access now look we get to call and now we have the biggest  you know union companies and stuff like that salivating begging for our work and  stuff but we couldn't call a local plumber before without risk or fear of like i  mean even you know something having somebody having something on you yeah yeah it's  so nice now by the way to be able to like pick up the phone and call somebody when  something breaks like i don't want to do that okay we're going to pay somebody to  do it right we were never lying yeah we learned all the traits we did yeah we we  talked about this a little bit yesterday how i was giving you guys props and praise  of you know just doing this here alone because this is something this podcast and  and what you guys are doing even with like the facility advisors and and just  access to information for people in our industry whether it be people in the  caregiver market and or people like us that are large scale operators right we came  from a smaller scale at one point 16 nights 16 likes well yeah even smaller than  that at some places right how many people had to grow in their attic or garage  right so um access to information has always been super limited nobody has the  answers for everything right this is farming and there's always different things  that pop up and occur uh but to have something like this where it's it's not reddit  right and it's not like before grow shop counter at the hydro show which we all  which we got great advice what we had it's what we had no but but something like  this with some of the top growers and professionals in the world in this industry  specific with the amount of like r d backing that they're doing for this uh to have  something like this at just in arm's reach that's not a social media platform  that's just like visual based instagram right which people have gotten on off of  for years right got their information from from people like the jungle boys and and`

`miami mango and guys like that that that put all their info online because they  want to help and teach people and kind of bring the industry up so like people like  us can really appreciate a platform like this where you know you could just listen  to a couple different podcasts and it's things that people aren't talking about  right charlie and i you know i've been doing this for a little over 10 he's 20 50  you know 25 years into this thing uh old-school methodologies right like you would  tell me not to flush my plant to tell you you're crazy tell me to feed a clone at  2100 ppm i tell you you're right so there's a lot of things that's kind of like  breaking our cycles into what we thought we knew or what was right to us at the  time with changes in in the industry and you know what we have the resources that  we have to be able to implement different things that we're kind of shamed at that  time right um to learn those new things it opens up the book a little bit more for  us but when you guys back that up with like facility advisors right like that's the  differentiating factor there you're not just saying like hey this is what you  should feed the plants or this is like you've got like legit people who are out  here in the world like showing up in our grow and talking to us and these are  people who have as much and more experience as any of us and it's it's extremely  valuable and it's not just a sales pitch as the other like like you know often  times where you know you get as much customer service as is needed to get the sale  or attached to the sale yeah right they kind of go hand in hand but then but then  it's kind of that's it right so the idea that you know you guys are sharing this  information and the jungle boys and ivan and roach and these guys are are an open  book and they're allowing you guys to help and you're allowing us and like it's  it's the idea now that we can all kind of share information with each other and i'm  sure at the end of the day you know i used to say and i don't get to go in nearly  as many grows as i once was but you know i've never walked in a grown not learned  something from it and that includes the shittiest grows that i've ever seen 100  right and um so getting like minds together to just bounce ideas the most  productive conversations that we have as it relates to our operations are tyler and  i just kind of like bouncing [Â __Â ] off of each other and like well i think this  and this and right and that's plug more people with more experience and i.e alex  and whoever else like yeah [Â __Â ] man and that's the opportunity i think that  that i saw that you know brandon and i came up with this idea was you know being in  sales my whole life it was you know you got a product you sell it it's sold collect  the money done and you know for the fas to be able to put their eyes on the garden  and see something else that you guys don't see and then just be able to bounce the  ideas off each other and figure it out is you know obviously something that we've  never had in the industry but something that has has really taken the fa team to  the next level and you know a lot of the growers i mean they respect it they love  it you know it's it's something that is we're able to push the envelope you know a  lot further than we have ever done just with multiple eyes experiences um walking  into places instead of just verbally talking over the phone you know it's it's huge  it is it's the technical side of things too where i could like for somebody like me  that that's seeing something that's kind of out of the norm okay what are my  variables here what what am i doing differently well starters i've changed our  whole nutrient line right yeah um so to have somebody that's from that line to be  like yo i'm seeing a little bit of this and his response is send me your runoff  numbers okay so there's a technical answer that's gonna be following this it's not  just oh well you're doing this or that just an assumption it's let me see remotely  inside that substrate let me exactly let me see what that is so that i can actually  give you a proper answer not just give you some [Â __Â ] just run around to try to  get you to buy more of something right and uh like i said we haven't had a failure  on the program yet and we haven't unlocked the full potential but some of those  small conversations have gone a long way because maybe it was exactly what was said  in that conversation between the two of us or maybe it just unlocked a little idea  and something clicked where i was like you know what i need to do this a little  differently um so to have that as a tool is just to anybody the biggest growers in  the world are the smallest growers in the world um to be able to hit the instagram`

`or something and you know uh get a response back like hey this is you know i always  got really confused when i'd go on a nutrient company's page and it'd say oh we  don't answer our dms i'm like what does that make any sense you know it's like  we're here to like we got three guys full-time answering dms you know it's so  important get the the right knowledge out there um with with the fas and that  experience what's cool about it it's it's like we don't always have all the answers  but i think that we collab together and communicate to find a solution and a lot of  these guys you know sometimes alex how many times have you called chris duran and  you're like hey i have a problem here and i need to get to the bottom of it weekly  man yeah and again it's just you know always evolving and learning and just not  being stuck in your ways and just being open-minded to that there could be a  different solution a different route um and just getting a different perspective on  that problem um you know at hand yeah i think it's there usually always is a  different route in another million ways yeah i think it's important for our fas to  always have humility you know because it's we've we've we've had you know a few  more ego you know personalities on the team that didn't last long mm-hmm um but  with that humility you're not afraid to go out and say hey i don't know the the  right answer to this question before i tell king's garden to do this i'm going to  call you know we're learning every day exactly it's we don't have all the answers  but we have the team uh to find the answer for that specific problem for sure yeah  we yeah exactly yeah are you guys uh you guys are in california are you planning to  expand to any other states or anything in the works that you feel comfortable  talking about nothing that we're really you know so we're so focused on right now  this expansion what we're doing in california we have always known that california  was like the make it or break it place right so it's home to all of us to begin  with so it was important you know but it's you know to tyler's point the most  discerning market and it's gonna chew up and spit out a lot of cannabis companies  in the next couple of years yep um so we've always you know been proud of the idea  that we can succeed or have been succeeding in california we want to prove that we  can continue to do that it's really really hard for me to think of how we can  expand into other states while maintaining the integrity and the and the like  devotion to the way that we do things in sops so of course we love the idea the  concept right certain states more than others obviously um are really intriguing  it's highly highly likely if you ever see us in another state which as of right now  is not you know the case but if you do see us in another state it would likely be  under like a licensing type of model um because again the idea that like tyler and  i can go to florida and be there all the time is it's just difficult for us right  now with all the expansion and stuff that we've got going on so potentially through  some sort of a licensing deal or something like that um but no we're just so  focused right now on this this local expansion but kudos to those who have figured  out ways to uh to make that happen yeah in particular the jungle boys been  following them like in their florida expansion looks like they're about ready to  open up retail looks like they've got their first harvest already come down and so  super cool to watch um people that we respect be able to pull that off and do it  not under this public mso model um you know we we know all too well how that works  and and um so the idea that they pulled that off you know the way they've pulled  everything off stressed it is just just like you guys you guys are the same way you  guys are operators yeah you know to the core like you guys are cultivators your  operators um the same exact thing as as ivan and the boys so it's it's awesome to  see do you get a lot of inbound on your instagram or inbound in general from a  state that's like hey like when you come in here when you come in here i know you  guys do we see it yeah we see it and neither one of us actually are running the  social media so we see it less but the states that i've heard people are always  asking about are actually the states that you they're they're the right states to  be in it's the floridas and the the jerseys in new york's and stuff but again most  of those with their idea of the vertical integration and the need for vertical  being vertical i'll say it again we're not retail operators yeah um and that's  another reason why it would be like through a partnership and a licensing type deal`

`like going in to grow fire product in another state like using our sops and our  kind of um you know system that's i could see that doable but going in and running  you know multiple retails because you have to be vertical and stuff like that  that's it's not our expertise i'll be totally honest with you i don't think i could  successfully pull off a retail i think you'd want to and i know i don't want to i  ran a retail hydro store for like 12 years and uh i lived there for four of those  years yeah so and that's what it really takes to get you know the retail customer  satisfaction and and the whole customer front facing is uh is difficult what uh  what advice would you have for a new brand coming up new cannabis brand that's  coming up what what advice would you would you give a new brand coming up that that  wants to make it big in this state in california i'd wish him luck buckle up yeah  buckle up yeah it's gonna be a wild ride it's tough to say but i ultimately think  that the companies that are gonna succeed in any state um and some and this isn't  like you know the only ones that will but i think a big part of it's going to be um  you know just remaining loyal to who you are as a company and starting out like the  the kind of family feel and what we have the the workplace vibe and just what  happens there is is such a big part of what king's garden is and if you lose touch  of like i started growing weed because i wanted access to more weed to smoke and of  course to sell on the traditional market and stuff like that but you got to  remember why you started and i have a a dear friend of mine who we lost on on the  hill working um one year but we'd be in the middle of like busting our ass maybe  running miles of poly pipe through a forest trekking up a hill rolling water tanks  uphill to get them to the high spot digging ponds developing springs you name  whatever pick the backbreaking job you were doing on that given day and um carlos  would look up he's charlie there's got there's got to be an easier way to smoke a  joint right and so you got to remember we did this because we wanted to smoke more  joints we did it because i wanted better weed i wanted more weed eventually it was  i want to provide for my family and myself but if you lose touch to the idea that  that this is all about the plant then i think you're destined to fail yeah and if  it just becomes a rat race uh where you're staring at the books all day and trying  to squeeze a penny out of this or juice another dollar here um if you don't at  least have that doesn't mean you have to consume i'm a big consumer but at least  respect and love like some things change maybe i won't be able to consume my whole  life i mean i hope i will but maybe i won't but at least having the respect for it  right yeah absolutely i think a lot of companies are going to fail just based on  the idea that they have no love to begin with for the plant and therefore really  have no business in the space yeah yeah they don't understand it maybe i'm wrong  maybe they'll all succeed and will fail i don't know you saw it happening you saw  you saw it happen in canada yeah you know you saw it i mean canada is a perfect  mirror of what the united states could will probably be you know because these now  you're seeing a lot of these smaller craft farmers my buddy chris is one of them  and he's got a small little hunter lighter up in canada he's putting out fire he's  running athena and he's and he's he's got a good solid business there but these big  huge aurora and canopy growth they're i mean i talked to a lot of guys in canada  and they're like they're failing hard hard but it's a matter of how long they have  access to public capital allows that drowning to be a much slower process they were  failing years ago i checked out these i was in canada we almost went public and  that's a whole nother story for another day but well five years ago these places  were growing garbage and talking about how they were working the kinks out talking  about how they've got gmp certified facilities that can't grow crap like it's it's  dog [Â __Â ] excuse my so true uh very cool to hear that you know somebody's  finally figuring it out out there oh yeah i guess my point in that is that yes i  hope that if anyone's gonna fail it's not your friend growing fire and that it is  the ones who are you know but the reality is your friend doesn't have access to  unlimited capital i'm guessing and some of those guys just keep going back go back  to canaccord and raise more money yeah right and yep i had uh autumn carcion loved  that did you yeah yeah thanks that's cool they uh so i had her on and we talked  about tax reform and she's got a big movement are you guys doing anything to get`

`behind tax reform on cannabis i'm i'm following autumn's lead i'm using her  boilerplate um templates to get them to both of the cities that we're in palm  springs and cathedral city cathedral city's already received theirs i work i'm  actually on the task force the cannabis task force in cathedral city um so i'm very  vocal in that in that particular city and pushing hard for it it's very interesting  topic um it's dealing with local i loved her approach right she's like we're gonna  start with the cities and and they've had some great success with some of these  bigger cities oakland and san francisco and things like that right little city of  cathedral city the response is and don't this isn't me accepting it we will  continue to push but the response is that they've already baked in so we're saying  you got a lower they're they're some of the highest cannabis taxes in the state  they're 10 per 10 percent gross revenue for dispensaries and they're 10 per square  foot annual for cultivation so some of the highest in the state and we're pushing  them to say it's aligned with some of the neighboring cities and some of the other  just cities in the state closer to five dollars a square foot and closer to five  percent gross revenue their immediate response is that they've already baked in the  revenue from that they're expecting from this ten percent and ten dollars per  square foot into the next two years budgets so if you tell them we're going to  reduce the taxes by 50 they're looking at a 4 million whatever it is like deficit  of where are we gonna where's this money coming from so the council the the  policymakers the immediate response from them is show me where this other money is  coming from which i didn't know i was supposed to be their accountant now or  they're you know so they're not they won't accept just on the surface that we need  to reduce our taxes because that's going to throw their budget out to which our  response is watch what's happening to your taxes right now already month over month  they're declining don't do it kill the businesses in your city and then what are  you gonna do where's the money coming from then you got zero you got zero right so  we're trying to like be so dealing with policy makers on a small city where the  only responsibility like that they feel they have is to the constituents who you  know elected them and that's it they just think and so it's tough it's an uphill  battle in these little cities i think you're gonna see more success and autumn is  like amazing for being able to do this like in these bigger cities that have a more  like liberal and progressive thought and ability to kind of think down that road  than you are in these cities that are like oh you're just talking about taking my  money away like that's how they see it right i'm just i'm just asking for a  reduction in taxes because so much so that we have some of the community task force  members who are like well it's not our fault if you guys can't run a good business  this is what happens in any new business like you guys obviously just aren't good  at business so you'll fail and someone else will take over your spot and like and  then you got other people you know and they're like saying like guys if king's  garden is failing like your whole cannabis in the city or valley is at risk right  and right over the red we'll keep trying we'll keep trying and we won't stop but i  don't know how successful we'll be at where price at where the price of cannabis is  right now and where your tax structure is for a cathedral city is it sustainable no  i didn't think so absolutely not so you know the market needs to adjust or the  costs need to go down for us to come out of the red yeah right i mean i think i'm  not ashamed to say it i think that anybody who's in this space right now is is is  seeing the same things we're a very very lean company and we're very very good at  what we've what we do as a result we've been able to put some money into savings  when times were better but the way things are right now we will burn cash and i  believe most companies will until the point that they can't anymore you're not the  only one yeah i know i know i'm not jungle boy jungle boys is having the same  problem mm-hmm yeah everybody yeah it's not sustainable these taxes are not  sustainable that's not that's crazy and and the cost you know it's it's it's one of  two things right it's like i said i mentioned lowering the cost we've done that  thank you to you guys again for a lot of that like help and guidance there we have  done that um but that's not like we we've skinned that thing down so much like  we're really really lean and really really good at we what we do our costs aren't`

`we don't have a lot of a lot of ability to lower costs what we need to do is lower  taxes yeah yeah because the costs are pretty damn fixed at this point yeah i think  i think the net i think 2022 especially 2023 um if things don't change on tax  reform you're going to see him drop drop like flies we'll see what happens right i  think i've heard that uh newsom is directly spoken on the topic now i guess he's  mentioned that he's gonna have the discussion so i don't know i don't know but it's  over taxed and what other i mean what other industry do we see municipal and state  taxes on such high levels and the end product is in some situations i'm hearing 40  plus percent taxes by the time it gets to the consumer and then you wonder why it's  the black market or gray market or elicit market is just thriving yeah right  because they're selling depths for good debts for 300 400 a pound and they're not  taxed yeah i don't think anything's been as taxed as heavy as cannabis ever no in  history just wait till the feds come on i know yeah was it five percent tax right  well that yeah and look i'm guilty of it i've always said but this is where like  it's i've i wanted i encouraged legal cannabis right i was a proponent of it and i  said like give us a rule book let us follow the rules and we'll do it right i  believed that we could make a legitimate industry out of it i could make a  legitimate living for myself and raise my family and my kids this way but i knew it  needed to be out of the shadows and kind of into the light in order for that to  happen so i was a proponent i said let's do this let's like give us rules let's do  it i just don't think that anyone ever expected the rule book to look like a bible  right just a thick thick thick and i don't think that we really knew what we were  asking for i stand by the idea that i want i want to be you know in this position i  want to be a proponent of legal cannabis and i want to play in this space but like  the idea that we just openly accepted everything they threw at us was a big fault a  big flaw in our part right on my part and many others part like we're like oh  here's our rule book without actually reading it or anything first right yeah so i  mean well back then you did the math and it made sense that's the other thing what  worked out that's what i'm telling the city of cathedral city right i helped write  that ordinance right i agreed to that ordinance when it was put into place and when  it was put into place the numbers worked out it penciled out for lack of a better  term it penciled out and now it doesn't yep right so and that's also i mean it's  compounding the issue with uh you know inflation and cost of goods i mean that's  not helping the situation at all i mean that's why is the price of everything going  up right now labor fuel like all of our input materials power just everything is  going up but the price of our finished good is just soaring downward yeah  recreational consumable man yeah yeah it's just it's that one's like you know you  can't buy a used car for for what they paid for it brand new you know it's no use  car prices are through the roof right now everything it's crazy new car price used  car prices it doesn't matter what they are they're through the roof but the price  but you can buy the best best best best cannabis you've ever seen for the lowest  prices right yeah just like literally like what you look at these bags you're like  oh my god these are just fire right so and it's happening all the way through it's  on the commercial i mean it's on the the bulk wholesale side um but it but look at  what these retailers are getting beaten up too we keep hearing these terms if it's  not a bogo it's a no-go right you go and try and sell your product into a store and  all these stores are like if it's not a bogo it's a no-go everyone wants free  product discount like you know they think they should be paying ten dollars for an  eighth of premium making you pay for shelf space yeah paying for shows that's  brutal that's yeah spotting fees tough times we're in you guys are in all the  cookies right yeah we uh you know they i want to say we are we have historically  been in all of the cookies they have different ownership structures kind of in  different locations and so things kind of change a little bit here and there but  we've always had a great relationship with the cookie store so i think we're mostly  mostly stizzy stores and all of those big players that have the the multiple  storefront operators um you know the one plants the sizzies the cookies um we're  seeing you know a lot of love from all those people it's awesome yeah those are the  unfortunately those are the like only guys in that space that seem to be surviving`

`all of these single owned mom and pop shops are struggling holding on yeah barely  holding on yeah uh tyler you you know we talked about chris earlier but you are now  on their new dilution solution system yeah i'm happy you brought that up uh so  chris came to us end of 2020 um i said hey i got something that's ready for you  like i got something uh so we took a trip out from colorado and sat with uh us and  our boy carlos who we introduced to us uh from bear ag and uh long story short we  were the first people at scale and in california that he installed the dilution  solutions controller um with into our facility in an existing facility actually our  largest facility uh 1100 light facility so we took that one had batch tanks already  kind of ran on dosatrons and things of that nature um pulled everything kind of you  know sequentially and installed that that's a game changer for us and moving  forward even more so uh because of the accessibility i have with it like remotely  um but also the consistency and the uh kind of user interface i have a different uh  interaction with the facility now because of that so just to give you like an  example we use it for fertigation i don't use it for irrigation at the time it was  an existing facility so all of our irrigation lines and wires have already been ran  it was a headache to try to change that and what we were doing was no different  than what that was gonna do for us at the time right uh but for fertigating now we  could have one skid instead of a doser for every single batch of rooms batch of  tanks and or dosatron for a recipe um no more direct inject directly to the plant  yep uh one skid with the editrons uh hooked to this computer this controller where  we input all of our recipes so whichever and we started this excuse me we started  this with with our original recipe um and it was actually really good that we did  that because you know with the time chris spent with us in the facility uh setting  this thing up we learned a lot about chemical compatibility with with the certain  like acidic values of different ingredients being mixed together uh with less  contact time or you know mixing time with with water and all of these things um to  where there was kind of like a diminishing return on the amount of product that you  were putting in to reach a certain conductivity value wasn't adding up the same as  like a dosatron or like your hand mix application would right so we're like beating  our heads up working on this thing for weeks and weeks and and you know dialing it  in differently than how you would expect to and then we swapped everything to that  two part and it was just like again the the stability and the chemical  compatibility that these ingredients have with each other they're just meant to be  you know injected or mixed however you want to do it it just it it's it's spot on  you say i want 50 mls of this ingredient and it's going to give me 2ec right that  that's what that value is going to eat it's going to make sense at the end of your  line but so basically we have all of our recipes and put it into the into the  controller and at just the touch of a button i can fill groups of batch tanks  within hours for the same day or next day however you want to do it for specific  harvest so depending on what stage of that plant or that room is in if i want three  c two whatever it is um we're scheduling everything in advance again going back to  like as much as you can schedule out the better you are so i'm implementing this  thing to have kind of like our baseline formula uh in it so okay we're going to  plant this room on this day programming the whole flower cycle yep that's game  having recipes already set right giving the baseline and kind of the the platform  that just based like off of experience like this is what the plant is going to want  granted it will give you override access and like things for subject to change like  we need to do this on this day whatever whether it be a pot reset or you know  increase our ec things of that nature but that's up to the operator or myself to be  able to make those adjustments on the fly but it gives you your like your your  whole harvest basically the day that you plant i know that it's to need this within  these weeks and these days and it's going to just kind of be scheduling right  coming in game changer yeah we're doing some some crafty [Â __Â ] with it uh long  story short we're trying to put things on loops where we can measure you know ec  conductivity uh you know ph in your batch tank uh we're automating stock tank  systems a little bit differently not just something that you can go and buy off the  shelf like a neutral solve or something we're gonna design our own concept you know`

`volumetrically where like a hopper can dump you know an amount like a certain  amount of salt by weight right so you don't have to like worry about how many bags  that i set out for this 200 gallon stock tank right you don't need to worry about  that stuff anymore so that's going to allow us to do stuff like that right moving  forward on your new builds all dilution solution yep yep sick shout out chris man  thanks for product right on all editron no more dosatrons yep editron and tuition  solutions i would i was i'm a big fan of dosatrons you know but i just haven't  really i did editron a long time ago and i was using monosilicic acid and i just  you know i never put it in my lines again so i'm still you know haven't gone back  to the editron thing but it was another example of one of those things i had to  break down that barrier a little bit right dosatrons i love they're mechanical  hydropowered right so you're never worried about power failures or anything like  that right it's it was i understood like you know the basis of it and so it made it  you know nice and easy for me um the editron was you know required the the again  kind of breaking down what you know and saying like but chris does a good job of it  he explains that you know this isn't a new this isn't like you know just a brand  new thing that they created this is you know proven and has a track record and  something they've been working on for a long time and then his dilution solution  stuff is like the interface when you just look at it looks like you're looking like  an ipad or something as opposed to like i don't know if you ever looked on like  argus i mean obviously you guys have but like an argus system or some of those like  tank logic stuff anything that's controlling logic and stuff like that and it looks  like it's like windows 95 oh it's all right here yeah like what it is yeah and so  like you talked about noise yeah yeah you see like visual representations of how  full tanks are or something like that right like things just look like you're like  wow like that's cool yeah yeah going back on the editron i haven't used uh that for  any kind of dosing without a controller kind of telling it what to do so when you  have something like a dosatron and you're trying to inject ingredients it's based  off your flow rate and if your flow rates are off then you you turn a couple dials  you check your ec and you can adjust from that right so i can successfully long  story short i can successfully operate with a dosatron any flow rate given i have  you know the bare minimum with the editron it's it's speaking to flow sensors so  it's picking up the flow that's coming in and and making its adjustments clicks per  second based off of the flow that's coming in it's not like a volumetric thing  where it's like hey you need to be at this many pounds of pressure for it to work  where it's x mils per gallon actually equals that it's based off of your flow  coming in so say if you got a dual dab for for trying to mix the the tanks a little  bit quicker trying to fill tanks quicker and one of them goes out right it's going  to make that adjustment and you're not going to be [Â __Â ] at the end of it it's  just going to take longer so it has kind of that safety buffer on top of that mint  you can get so tricky with this thing and every single shutoff valve like like  anything right safety precaution across the board on your facility overflow ports  things things of that nature where like it'll send you an alarm it'll shut a master  valve off right if a solenoid kicks open it will measure its rates and it's like  hey you called for a thousand gallons of water and it takes this long with the flow  rate that we've we've been filling at it's been running for longer it's going to  shut off just based off knowing that it's it's you know your your flow sensor in  the in the tank has failed potentially yeah yeah so we're done yeah run  redundancies man yeah absolutely for sure yeah it's all roach is switching to  they're putting editrons they're putting uh dilution solution everywhere yeah chris  is a smart guy yeah he's just he knows what he's doing he knows what he's doing  yeah he does for sure cool guys i really appreciate you guys uh making the trip out  taking the time out for sure appreciate it appreciate you guys appreciate the  support looking forward to like continuing this partnership we got going on yeah  and can't thank you guys enough for just being solid cats that yeah you know do  what you say you're gonna do in a world full of uh [Â __Â ] smoke and mirrors it's  nice to it's nice to you know be aligned with people who are vibing yeah so thank  you like you guys appreciate you guys thank you thank you i appreciate you always`

`all right wrap it up that was sick yeah that was dope that was fun thank you guys`  

`all right tasa how are you doing i'm good how are you doing good thanks for being  here today yeah of course thanks for for having me i'm this is an honor yeah how  long how you just got off a plane i did i just got off a plane um it was a short  ten minute drive over here and the weather is gorgeous so i'm really excited about  that too yeah um i'm terrible at introductions i figured that out so i'm just gonna  let you uh introduce yourself and tell us where you're from okay sure um so my  name's tasa i was born and raised in colorado um and i did all of my education  there i am a molecular biologist i did my graduate work in cu boulder and that  focused on neurodegeneration actually and structured rna i then went on to do my  post-doc at the health sciences center in denver where i looked at actually nascent  structured rna and how rna can lead to uh different diseases um so basically we  were me and a couple of our science friends were in our postdoc and you know we're  kind of done with academia and we wanted to take what we knew how to do and apply  it to do something useful to solve problems and so we decided to start a biotech  company um which was sort of the inception of tumi genomics we kind of dabbled in a  lot of different industries we did some work on cancer genomics um viral genomics  we ended up creating and directing the covid surveillance lab at the university of  colorado for about a year and sort of underneath that we were also working on viral  pathogens in cannabis and you know over time we realized that the need in cannabis  for accurate diagnostics for scientific education for you know bridging that gap  between the research and academia and what's going on in the industry was uh was  huge and it seemed like a really great place for us to focus and make a big  difference how how long have you guys been doing cannabis viroid testing yeah so we  actually started testing for hot platen viroid um i'm going to say sort of  informally last spring maybe um so basically we were we were working on covid and  i'm doing a lot of pcr on covid and we had a grower friend contact us and say oh i  have this viroid and my grow and i know you guys are doing pcr diagnostics and can  you help us out and you know we were you know we're just a bunch of scientists and  we're like sure this this looks really interesting and and viroids they're horrible  but their biology is really cool so we designed some assays and um you know she  really liked it and she started telling people about it and it just kind of grew  from there so so you know hoplite and viroid it's a viroid not a virus what what's  the difference yes so um viroids are one of the simplest forms of life that we know  of so as opposed to a virus which has kind of an outside protein coat like  sometimes you'll see it as like a diamond and then it has like these little legs  viroids don't have any outside protein they're simply a free-floating piece of  circular genetic information they're really really really tiny but pretty  infectious in plants now are they harder to track or treat compared to a virus so  they're different i guess would be the best way to put it there are certain types  of tests you cannot do on a viroid so like i'm sure people because of covet have  heard of like antigen tests so those types of tests look for protein and that  they're really fast with a viroid you can't use tests like that so you have to go  with a molecular test because it's it's just the genetic information so it has to  be pcr or other versions so you have to do a full dna pcr test to be able to see a  viroid yes it has to be a molecular test of some kind yep so that kind of you know  as far as some of the questions that we were getting on ig were you know is there a  kit or a test that we could use in the field to test for hotplate and viroid yes so  there are certain types of technology that you can do in the field um one of the  ones that is employed most frequently is called rt lamp so rt lamp is similar to  pcr in the sense that it also finds the genome of the viroid but it uses a  specialized enzyme so the whole thing can happen at one temperature so you can put  it in a machine and it just sits at like 65 celsius and it amplifies the viroid and  then you're able to see it there's a lot of different ways to do it a color change  or sometimes there's a glow no glow those tests are definitely have their place and  they're quick and on-site they tend to be a little bit less sensitive than a pcr so  i like to tell people when you use those on-site tests at least the ones i'm aware`

`of you it's really good at finding positives it's less good at finding true  negatives what so just going back what is pcr yes okay so pcr is a method where you  use these little tiny things called primers and they go into the tube and they look  for a specific sequence of the viroid genome and if they find that sequence they  use an enzyme called tac polymerase and so what that enzyme does is find the  sequence and then it makes billions of copies of that sequence so even if you only  have one or two copies in the tube when you're done with the pcr you have billions  of copies and so it's much easier to detect it the nice thing about most pcrs is  that there's a laser that reads every minute or so how much viroid is being  amplified in that tube and it can actually make a graph of how much there is and so  it can be quantitative so it isn't just is your plant infected or not you can say  oh this has really high viroid load or really low thyroid load so a pcr kind of  just amplifies the dna and makes a small piece of dna much larger yeah so it takes  a small piece of dna and then it makes of that one tiny piece it'll make billions  of copies okay so so it gives you a more broader test yes range so you can see it  yep and then you have lt lamp which is a different technology right right so it's  um so it's rt lamp okay yes but so rt lamp um it's similar in the sense that it  also finds a piece of the genome and it makes billions of copies but it uses a  different enzyme and this enzyme is able to function at one set temperature so pcr  normal pcr requires the cycling of temperatures which necessitates like a big  expensive machine whereas rt lamp can all be run at one temperature so you can just  do like a little heat block or something um so it's also an amplification  technology but slightly different so going on the on the product to have in the  field is it expensive to have something in the field that will be doing be able to  see hopline by it or test in the field um so there's several different tests some  of them are not terribly expensive um and they're not even that complicated to run  so i don't know if people have seen those tests where you have a tube and it's pink  and then it'll turn yellow so that's rt lamp and those aren't expensive or  difficult to run um there are also like handheld type platforms that you can buy i  think idea has one that you can even get some sort of quantitative information  that's a little bit more expensive because it's a machine we're actually working on  an on-site platform too that that was my next question yes yeah yeah so um there's  a lot of potential issues with rt lamp because it can be non-specific it can throw  false positives and because of that it's not terribly sensitive um we so what we've  actually done is changed the chemistry of rt lamp um to improve some of the  problems so ours it has an internal control it's more sensitive it's less subject  to human error um and it's it's high throughput so it'll be able to do 93 samples  at a time wow and when is that going to be ready you're thinking so we're hoping to  have the beta version ready in the next few months um and then the full version  which comes with the full analysis machine um that will feed directly into a  database that's probably a little farther off that's super exciting yeah no we're  we're really excited we actually we developed it uh for covid and it was being used  for that but um i think it can have a lot of applications in cannabis too yeah  that's awesome um so what is dna sequencing yes um so to understand this um i might  have to delve really shortly into a lesson in biology i'll try not to be super  boring so um so dna is basically the instruction manual inside your cell that tells  the cell everything that it needs to know to do whatever it needs to do um and so  just like an instruction manual or an encyclopedia it has dna has letters but  instead of 26 like the english alphabet it just has four so a t c and g and it's  the order of these letters that give the meaning just like in language um it also  has punctuation marks and capital letters and it even has sentences so sentences um  in in dna sequence are called genes and they're like one complete unit that can be  understood um and so when you get a dna sequence you're getting the order of those  letters um with the idea that you can then find um meaning in that by identifying  where the sentences are and what they're trying to communicate and with in in that  and that's pretty much genomics is testing and looking at that sequence yes trying  to understand what the order means how the sequences interact with each other how  they're expressed in the cell are you familiar with anybody taking those dna`

`sequences and you know applying intellectual property towards them i mean what do  you know about that because i was watching some stuff on dna sequencing and  intellectual property with cannabis and like the first question that comes to my  mind is like how when it's not federally legal yeah yeah so um so i will preface  this with i'm not a lawyer so take it with a grain of salt um so i do believe that  you can patent cannabis even though it's not federally legal um in order to get a  patent you have to prove that whatever the strain is that you've created is unique  it's non-obvious it's not available in the wild and you've created it so one of the  advantages to dna sequencing is that you can sequence the genome of some you know  new cool strain that you've created and then you can identify genetic markers that  track with whatever that trait is that you think is is unique and non-obvious and  that data can help you with your application because you can claim that that this  is the genetic basis for it i mean you created that so just breeding two genetics  together and creating another dna sequence right because that's what you'd be doing  you could take that and possibly patent that yeah so if you so example if you put  two plants together and you create a new plant that has some sort of unique  cannabinoid or some really cool growth pattern or whatever um if you can find the  genetic basis for that and you can prove that that you know most of the cannabis  plants out there don't have that allele or that sequence in their dna um then you  can make the case that you've created a new strain that is non-obvious and unique  and then you can patent that are they doing that a lot in vegetable crops that you  know of or yeah so there's a lot of um patents in in normal agriculture for new  strains or um you know a lot of times you'll have two genetics and you cross them  together and you create something called an f1 hybrid which is a really robust  plant and you can you can sort of patent that process too so can anyone patent  genomes just off the street you know hire a ip attorney and just so my  understanding is as long as you can um defend that you have invented it and created  it and that it's unique and non-obvious um then yeah it seems weird when it's you  know it's like a natural plant yep yeah i mean it seems like how can you patent  that right exactly yeah so you're you're patenting like a unique trait exactly um  can with genomics can you map lineage and see where certain cannabis plants have  come from yeah so what you can do is um you can take a cannabis plant and you can  sequence the dna and you can analyze spots in the dna that tend to change so they  call these spots snips or indels and you can find all the places that it looks  different in the dna sequence and then you can compare it to a reference genome or  another cannabis strain and depending on how many of those differences um they have  from each other you can say whether or not these two strains are genetically really  close together or genetically farther apart and telling you where that plant came  from a certain region yeah in its lineage yes as long as there's enough genomic  information or genomes available for the different regions and different types of  lineages you can fit it in there with breeding cannabis plants can genomics certain  genetic expression so that's a complicated question um right now the genomic space  in cannabis is in its infancy um the genome was just sequenced no in the last  couple of years and even though it's sequenced there's still parts of it that  aren't done yet i think 10 of it or so is missing depending on which reference  genome you look at and something like 10 to 25 percent of the reads can't be mapped  um so in order to predict genetic expression you not only have to have the sequence  you have to be able to find the genes or the sentences in that sequence and then  you have to be able to know what they do and how different changes in each sentence  is going to impact how the plant looks and that's a really complicated process and  the cannabis genetics space is getting there but i don't think it's quite there yet  is there one like firm or lab that kind of leads the charge of you know sequencing  cannabis or does everybody come together as a whole um so there are academic labs  that are doing sequencing there are industry labs like medicinal genomics that are  doing sequencing but you know they're they're also publishing papers and making uh  some of the genomes publicly available which is is really helpful for advancing um  our understanding of the genome so so they could say hey we found this gene and we  visually look at the plant and the plant seems to grow shorter or have wider leaves`

`and hardier yeah so what we're able to do in cannabis um is something called  forward genetics so in forward genetics you have a plant that has some sort of  interesting you know phenotype like flower whatever and you want to understand the  genetic basis of it you can sequence the the parents and then you can make a cross  and take you know hundreds of little babies and then sequence all of them and then  let them grow up and find the find which babies have that trait and then go back to  the dna sequence and find changes that correlate with the development of that trait  what's harder is reverse genetics which is where you look at the sequence and you  try to use it to tell the future like this is going to mean that this is going to  happen that's much more difficult this plant will grow taller or shorter or  possibly be disease resistant yes yeah so a lot of that is it requires a much more  in-depth understanding of not just the dna sequence but how that sequence is  interpreted by the cell and how that sequence interacts with the genetic background  of each of the cultivars and so it's it's a much more complicated question do they  have are you familiar with any genes that they've found that are more resistant to  powder mildew or botrytis yes so um they have been looking at this um i think that  they found something like 80 or more genes that can correlate with powdery mildew  resistance medicinal genomics did do one study that was pretty nice where they  found one specific gene that they thought could be the cause they took that gene  out and they expressed it in a bacteria and they showed that the protein that it  was making inhibited the growth of fusarium and so that's that's the closest i've  seen to actual causation so far would you be able to breed that gene into other  genetics using like crispr or something so theoretically you could do that um  whether or not that specific gene is sufficient in the plant in vivo to cause um  powdery mildew or fusarium resistance isn't known and you have to remember that if  there's you know something like 80 different genes that are controlling the  resistance how that gene is going to interact with the whole pathway to result in  resistance in the plant is a much more complicated question but theoretically if  scientists could find enough genes that confer resistance they may be able to  create resistant plants using crispr is crispr gmos or is that different so the  definition yes it's hard it's a hot that dmos is a difficult thing um i believe  that if you induce a gene that normally exists in the plant it's not considered a  gmo because it's you're sort of speeding up a natural process if i were to throw in  like a gene from a you know fish or something to make it cold tolerant or whatever  then that sort of crosses the gmo line but um it's fuzzy so crispr can be gm i mean  qualified as gmo it could it can or can't depending on on what you're doing with it  yeah so we uh so i i heard that we met because i used your i used to me to find  hoplite and virus viroid in my uh spot in nevada okay and i'd sent in some samples  worked with patrick yeah and got got got a bunch of samples back and we had taken  five cuts off of one plant and um every single cut came back as positive of hoplite  and viroid and i was like wow you know yeah this you know that we were able to weed  this out and i've been in a lot of a lot of facilities you know all around the  united states and a lot of the times you know i've been i was in one in vegas and  walking through the bedroom and i'm telling the guy hey you i think you got hoplite  and viroid here yeah um he you know he would no i don't i don't have populated  virus i don't know what that is i mean a lot of people don't know what it is yes  exactly you know what what is hobolate and thyroid yeah so hablate and viroid is a  tiny little uh free-floating piece of genetic information that um it actually was  first found in hops um of all i mean that's hence the name hoplite and viroid um  the reason they call it latent isn't because it can lie dormant like hidden in your  plant but because when they found in hops they couldn't find any effect for it so  they decided to call it latent which really just means asymptomatic that actually  turned out to not be such a great name because it isn't totally asymptomatic in  hops either it can mess up like oil and acid levels in the flour and some cultivars  are super sensitive um and then of course in cannabis it's it's not asymptomatic at  all so um it was just a poor name choice so so it's not latent it's not so this  it's a really confusing term so in science there's something called lytic and  latent so this is a cycle that some viruses do especially like retroviruses where`

`they can interpolate into the dna and then they just like hang out and they're kind  of quiescent they don't make they don't replicate or make new viral particles and  then when conditions are right they sort of wake up and they enter a lytic cycle  where they're doing a lot of replication hop late and thyroid doesn't do that so it  doesn't actually technically have a latent phase if it's in the cell it's it's  trying to replicate itself now how how what are the growth characteristics that  you've witnessed i know you're i i don't are you do you spend a lot of time in the  garden or do you mostly just in the lab and running to me so i definitely spend  more time in the lab than in the garden but um i've seen i've definitely seen my  share of hapleton thyroid infected plants and talked to a lot of growers so um i do  know that the symptoms can be really plyotropic so you can which means like super  varied so you can have a plant that's either really severe or you know so subtle  that you don't even see it um common symptoms are you know your plant will be slow  growth you can have malformed leaves leaf chlorosis brittle stems sometimes you'll  see like sort of a horizontal grow or the leaves will overlap a little bit but of  course the most insidious phenotype is that it it totally destroys the flower um  and yeah at that time is too late yeah yeah you're already three four weeks into  flower and then you're you're seeing what's coming out of there and it's it's not  yeah it's a huge a huge disappointment yeah yeah you know it takes a really trained  eye to see hot plane vibrate yeah you know i've i've worked with uh a few growers  at my spot and i'd walk through the the veg room and i'd be like hey you got hlv  here you got hlv here and they're like what do you mean like yeah i was like you  kill this plant you know kill the plant throw away the scissors yeah you know yeah  um what i've seen is it's kind of instead of the the branching you know first signs  that i look for instead of the branching growing up at more of a direct straight  angle you kind of see this flow out sideways and then up yeah yeah you know those  that's one sign you know they they come out sideways and then they go up instead of  shooting straight off the main stem and then also you kind of get this slight curl  of the leaves start to kind of come together a bit and you'll see you'll see that  um and then that's in veg and that's those are the first signs that that i really  look for but in flower it's like you know you've already filled up half your garden  with hlv and then you're flowering out and you're like do i even keep keep this  going right exactly yeah um how does hlv spread in the garden yeah so hlv spreads  via mechanical damage so um unfortunately the biggest offender for hiv spreading is  is us it's very efficient at spreading on unsterilized tools so if you're trimming  a plant that has hlv and then you use those same scissors on your next plant you've  just inoculated the next plant with hlv it can also spread to a lesser extent on  like a trimmer's hands or maybe even their clothes especially if you get sap or  something and you're not changing your gloves or cleaning them with bleach before  you move to the next plant that's a potential spread there too even not you don't  have to just open up the plant say we take a cutting you're opening up the tissue  of the plant you can spread it just by touching so you have to you have to have  mechanical damage but it doesn't have to be like catastrophic right so um you know  if you're trimming and you get a little bit of goo on your gloves or whatever then  it's it's on your fingers and it's it's a potential possibility if you're not  sterilizing yourself between each plant that that even your hands could spread it  can bugs like thrips and mites spread hlv yeah so that's a good question um they  have looked at this question in hops um they did an experiment a long time ago  where they took like 1700 aphids and they threw it on a really infected hot plant  and they looked them munch away and then took those aphids and threw them on  healthy hot plants and they didn't develop hot plate and viroid and so the  conclusion from that study was that at least in that setting with hops the bugs  weren't transmitting it um that doesn't mean that it couldn't happen in an indoor  grow setting with cannabis plants um so it's kind of an unknown right now have you  seen some genetics not susceptible to hopland virus they have hoplay environ but  they're still getting good yields they're still getting terpene production they're  still getting all the everything and it still has hotplate and thyroid so i've  never seen that but that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist and i have talked to`
