FOREWORD
T h is volum e assem bles selected p roceed in gs from th e Second
International Colloquium on d ie "Physiopathology o f Cannabis and the
D etection o f Illicit D rugs", w hich w as held at the N ational Academ y o f
M edicine 'with the assistance o f die City o f Paris.
The physiopathology o f cannabis is a subject o f m ajor im portance far
the future o f ou r society. It so happens that the acute im pairm ent o f
cann abis on m en tal fu n ction w as d escrib ed in 1845 by a French
physician Joseph M oreau, the father o f m odern psycho-pharm acology.
W h ile M oreau described the acute im p airin g effects o f h ash ish on
affective and cognitive functions o f the brain, he had no way o f assessing
dm physiopathological effects o f this drug.
To day» thanks to the new tech n iqu es o f m ed ical im agin g, it is
possible to visualize, as illustrated, by the studies of Dr. Nora Vblkow, the
im pairm ent o f brain
In areas w hich are connected w ith
coordination, balance, m em ory and coherent behavior. O ther studies
describe the noxious effects o f cannabis on reproductive function, and
im m une surveillance resulting in cancer and leukem ia.
The second theme o f this colloquium , detection o f illicit drugs in
bod y flu id s is also o f great im p ortan ce. W e have to p rotect our
com m unities from the use o f substances w hich im pair the integrity o f
atten tion , m em ory, coordination w hich are essen tial fo r the proper
perform ance o f profession n al task s. T estin g for drugs are already
practiced in competitive sports for detection o f anabolic substances, and
alcohol in road accidents. U nfortunately the present epidem ic o f drug
abuse has resulted in the consum ption o f other drugs. Like cannabis,
th ey im p air p ersisten tly in form ation p rocessin g b y the b rain and
p reven t it from perform ing correctly in d rivin g a car, m onitoring
equipm ent or using a com puter. It is therefore im portant to review
m ethods and results already obtained in the detection o f illicit drugs in
ttifFprw nt p n p n latinn g.

A t a tim e w hen stron g voices are advocating the relegalization o f
illicit drugs, and public health is threatened by the progression o f illicit
drug consum ption, the City o f P aris is proud to support outstanding
scientific studies which should help to promote prevention programs for
our youth. To day, I am eager to listen to scientists who are attem pting
to evaluate all o f the consequences o f m odem technology on man and
society. The control of the em ission o f toxic substances w hich pollute the
environm ent has been in itiated thanks to the efforts o f concerned
scientists. Som e o f them are now seeking m ethods to curtail the use and
trivialisation o f substances w hich pollute the internal m ilieu o f m an's
brain and other vital organs. Our concern today is therefore to preserve
m ental and physical health and specially that o f future generations.
Such is our hope and such is our goal.

Introduction
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine
imaging technique for measuring the regional and temporal
concentration of positron emitters within a volume element of
tissue (Phelps and Mazziotta 1986; Andreasen, 1988). Since carbon,
oxygen, and nitrogen all have positron- emitting isotopes, they can,
in principle, be used to label compounds without affecting their
pharmacological behavior (Fowler et al. 1990). The relatively short
half lives of the most frequently used positron emitters allows the
performance of repeated studies on the same subject without
jeopardizing the well-being of the individual.
From the perspective of the investigation of drugs of abuse,
PET can be used in conjunction with various types of tracers to
examine drug distribution and pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of
action and toxicity of drugs, and the neurochemical events
accompanying processes such as addiction and withdrawal.
For didactic purposes, we can divide the PET experimental
strategies into those that assess the effects of acute and chronic
drug administration on cerebral function, those that investigate the
effects
of acute
and
chronic
drug
adm inistration
on
neurotransmitters, and those that directly investigate the behavior
in the brain of the drugs of abuse labeled with a positron emitter. In
this chapter, we will review the basic principles behind PET
technology and its applications in the area of substance abuse. Even
though we will limit our discussion mainly to the application of
positron emission tomography (PET) in the investigation of
substances of abuse, many of the strategies employed can also be
utilized with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
and, when appropriate, we will illustrate with examples obtained
from this technique.
Instrument
Imaging with PET is feasible because of the decay properties
of positron emitters (For a more detailed description refer to
Hoffman and Phelps 1986, Volkow et al. 1988a). Positron emitters
are neutron-deficient isotopes that decay by liberating positrons.
The positrons travel a short distance (mean free path) before losing
their energy and colliding with an electron. Out of this collision two
high-energy photons (511 keV) are liberated simultaneously at an
angle of almost 180°. These photons are recorded by the PET camera
if they arrive simultaneously into two interacting detectors. Events

Section I. Physiopathology

are recorded as simultaneous if they are detected within a preset
time window period which usually averages 5-20 nsecs. The
generation of these two photons liberated in opposite directions
allows the location of the decay event within the volume delineated
by the line of view of the two interacting detectors. This enables
spatial discrimination without the need of collimators as required
with SPECT. Because coincident detection of positron emitters by
individual pairs of detectors is inefficient, PET cameras are
designed in such a way that each detector operates in coincidence
with other detectors simultaneously. In a typical PET camera,
detectors are placed in a ring, or multiple rings, to obtain multiple
images of the whole object at the same time. Events detected
coincidentally by pairs of detectors acting in coincidence will
represent the sum of activity along the line of view joining these
detectors. There is a coincident line of detection for each possible
combination of coincident detectors.
Detectors are crystals which fluoresce when exposed to
ionizing radiation. Several types of crystals have been used in PET.
The most commonly used has been bismuth germanate (BGO). The
advantage of BGO is its high stopping power which permits the use
of relatively small crystals. Since spatial resolution in the PET
camera is related in part to the size of the crystal, BGO enables to
achieve a higher spatial resolution than with other crystals. Cesium
fluoride (CsF) is another detector material which has been used for
PET cameras that require fast-counting statistics. Although CsF has
a lower stopping power than BGO, it has a smaller decay constant.
This translates into a better ability to handle high count rates
without saturating the crystal. Barium fluoride (BaF) has a fast
decay constant and also has a high stopping power, but it is very
expensive.
In the detectors, crystals are coupled with a photomultipler.
The photomultipler intensifies the light signals coming out of the
crystal and passes this information into the computer which then
applies mathematical algorithms that filter and back-project this
information to obtain an image. These algorithms are not dissimilar
to those used for CT scanning.. Mathematical models are then applied
to translate the information in the image to information that is of
physiological, pharmacological, or neurochemical relevance.

Isotopes and Radiopharmaceuticals
The positron emitters most commonly utilized in PET are
carbon 11, oxygen 15, fluorine 18, and nitrogen 13. The half lives for
these compounds are (F-18 (t-1/ 2 : 110 min) C-11 (t-|/2:20.4 min);
oxygen-15 (t-|/2:2 min); nitrogen-13 (t-|/2 :10 min)) (Fowler et al.
1988). Because of the short half life of these isotopes, a cyclotron
is required in the nearby vicinity to produce them. The radionuclides
can be utilized in the chemical form in which they are produced, as
in the case of O-15-labeled oxygen gas, to measure oxygen
metabolism, or fluorine 18 in the chemical form of fluoride to
measure bone density, or they can be incorporated into organic
molecules to measure specific metabolic or chemical pathways
providing that rapid synthetic routes can be developed. Most of the
studies with PET have been done using an analog of glucose
(deoxyglucose) labeled either with carbon 11 (CDG) (Reivich et al.
1982) or fluorine 18 (FDG) (Reivich et al. 1979). Deoxyglucose or 2deoxy-2- fluoro-D-glucose enters the cell and is phosphorylated at a
rate determined by the energy requirements of the cells (Sokoloff et
al. 1977). Once phosphorylated, it is trapped within the cell and
remains there without being further metabolized. This permits the
measurement of the concentration of CDG or FDG in a steady-state
condition. The strategy is similar to the one utilized with
autoradiography using 14C-deoxyglucose (Sokoloff et al. 1977). Once
injected, 30 to 35 min are allowed to elapse for uptake of the tracer
to occur. The PET measurements are made 35-55 min after injection.
The disadvantage of the use of deoxyglucose is that information
reflects the functional activity of the brain over a period of time of
relatively long duration (the 30-min uptake for deoxyglucose). The
advantage is that one is measuring directly the substrate that is
required for energy formation (Greenberg et al. 1981). Because in the
brain energy consumption and brain activity are tightly coupled, this
information can then be utilized to derive information about regional
brain function (Silver 1979). Under normal conditions, energy
consumption and cerebral blood flow (CBF) are tightly coupled so
that the measurement of CBF can also be utilized to assess regional
brain function (Silver 1978).
However, under pathological
conditions, the normal coupling between CBF and brain energy
metabolism can be lost (Wide et al. 1983). Furthermore, many of the
substances of abuse have direct effects on cerebral blood flow that
are separate from their effects on nervous tissue (Altura & Altura
1983) . Because of this, it is important to delineate whether changes

Section / . Physiopathology

in CBF after drug administration are secondary to its effect on brain
function, or whether they represent its vasoactive properties.
Oxygen 15 has also been utilized to measure energy
metabolism in the human brain (Lammertsma et al. 1981).
Surprisingly, studies done with cerebral activation and oxygen 15
have been unable to demonstrate regional increases in oxygen
metabolism secondary to brain activation tasks (Fox and Raichle
1985) as observed when measuring glucose metabolism (Reivich et
al. 1985) and/or CBF (Volkow et al. 1991a). These findings are
controversial since heretofore it was believed that cerebral
activation led to increases in glucose as well as oxygen metabolism.
More work needs to be done to evaluate if in human during cerebral
activation there is an uncoupling between glucose and oxygen
metabolism.
Several tracers have been developed to measure different
receptor systems (Schlyer et al. 1991). Most of the work, has
focused on the dopamine system. Tracers have been developed to
label sub-types of dopamine receptors. The most commonly used
tracers to label D2 receptors have been carbon 11 (Wong et al. 1986)
and fluorine-18-labeled N-methylspiroperidol (NMS) (Arnett et al.
1986) and carbon-11-labeled raclopride (Farde et al. 1986). Both of
these tracers differ with respect to their activity and specificity
for the D2 receptors. Methylspiroperidol binds to both dopamine and
serotonin receptors (Wong et al. 1984). However, dissociation from
the serotonin receptor is faster than that of the dopamine receptor.
Thus, after 80 min of injection, most of the activity remaining in
the brain represents binding into the D2 receptor (Schlyer et al.
1991).
In contrast, carbon-11 raclopride binds mainly to the D2
receptors. The affinity of NMS for the dopamine receptor is higher
than that of raclopride. This has the advantage of making it a much
more insensitive tracer to concentration of dopamine (Seeman et al.
1990). This is relevant since the rate of uptake of raclopride is
going to be affected by the intrasynaptic concentration of dopamine
at the time of the study. This can lead to miscalculation in the
quantitation of dopamine receptors. On the other hand, the relatively
lower affinity of raclopride for the dopamine receptor allows the
performance of displacement studies which are not feasible with Nmethylspiroperidol. Displacement studies are carried out in the
following way: the tracer is injected and allowed to reach peak
concentration and then pharmacologic doses of a compound that
affects synaptic dopamine concentration or interacts with the
receptors can be given to displace 1 C-raclopride (Dewey et al. in

25

26

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology , Detection

preparation). Using this strategy, different parameters can be
measured including the speed at which the drug enters the brain, the
relative changes in dopamine concentration from drugs that directly
or indirectly release dopamine, and/or the relative potency of drugs
that bind to the dopamine receptors when compared with raclopride.
Tracers have also been developed to label the Di receptors. The
most commonly used tracer has been C-11 SCH-23390 (Halldin et al.
1986). In the case of the investigation of drugs of abuse, interest
has also focused on other receptor systems such as the
benzodiazepine (Pappata et al. 1988), serotonin (Wong et al. 1987),
and the cannabinoid receptor (Herkenham et al. 1990).
Psychoactive drugs can also be labeled directly with a positron
emitter and their behavior can be monitored with respect to its
distribution in the brain, its kinetics, its binding characteristics,
its availability in plasma, and its distribution in other organs of the
body.

Cocaine
PET has been utilized to investigate both acute and chronic
effects of cocaine. These studies have been carried out to
investigate mechanisms of action of cocaine, mechanisms of
toxicity from cocaine, and processes involved in the reinforcing and
addicting properties of cocaine.
a)
Acute: The effects of acute cocaine administration in human
subjects were measured using PET and FDG in a group of chronic
cocaine abusers who were given 40 mg of cocaine i.v. (London et al.
1990). This study reports widespread decreases in brain metabolic
activity both in cortical and subcortical structures.
In this study,
the rate of metabolism correlated with the subjective sense of
intoxication. For this group of subjects brain metabolic response to
cocaine was affected by the degree of ventricular enlargement.
Subjects with enlarged ventricles were less sensitive to the effects
of cocaine on brain metabolism than those that had less ventricular
enlargement.
b)
Chronic: Most of the studies done on cocaine have focused on
the effects of chronic cocaine abuse on brain metabolism, cerebral
blood flow, and neurotransmitter activity.
A study that investigated the long-term effects of cocaine in
cerebral blood flow was done in a group of 20 chronic cocaine
abusers and 24 normal controls (Volkow et al. 1988b). Oxygen-15-

Section / . Physiopathology

labeled water was used to determine regional cerebral blood flow
(Raichle et al. 1983). Measurements of cerebral blood flow were
done on two separate occasions on the patients: within three days of
last cocaine use and then 10 days after cocaine detoxification. Upon
the first evaluation, most of the patients showed widespread
disturbances in cerebral blood flow. Fourteen of the 20 cocaine
abusers showed patchy areas of uptake for oxygen-15-labeled water
at various regions of the brain cortex. These effects were
predominantly in the frontal cortex and in the left hemisphere.
The
repeated study done after ten days of the last use of cocaine
continued to show disturbances of CBF. The decreases in CBF were
interpreted as representing vascular pathology secondary to the use
of cocaine. These findings have been replicated using SPECT to
measure changes in CBF of cocaine abusers (Mena et al. 1989). These
studies have documented defects in perfusion in both moderate as
well as heavy cocaine abusers. Cocaine could produce vascular
pathology secondary to its known vasoconstricting actions (Altura,
Altura 1985, Isnert and Chokoshi 1989). In fact, clinical studies
have documented the occurrence of cerebral strokes and
hemorrhages associated with cocaine consumption (Levine 1987,
Lichtenfeld 1984). Vasoconstriction from cocaine, if prolonged,
could produce vascular damage, tissue ischemia, and necrosis. Also,
the increases in blood pressure secondary to cocaine could favor the
occurrence of cerebral hemorrhages. These findings are of
pertinence in understanding the mechanisms of toxicity in cocaine.
This is relevant inasmuch as cocaine accounts for a considerable
amount of morbidity and mortality. Although most of the mortality
associated with cocaine stems from its cardiotoxic properties,
cerebral vascular accidents lead to a considerable amount of
morbidity and are increasingly being reported.
The effects of chronic cocaine have also been investigated
using FDG to measure regional glucose metabolism. These studies
examined the pattern of regional metabolism at the different phases
of cocaine detoxification. A study that investigated the effects of
acute withdrawal of cocaine was performed on a group of 15 chronic
cocaine abusers and 10 normal controls (Volkow et al. 1991b). Ten of
the cocaine abusers were tested within one week of last cocaine
use, whereas 5 were tested 2 weeks to 4 weeks after last
detoxification. When compared with the normal controls, the cocaine
abusers tested within one week of last use of cocaine showed higher
metabolic activity in the orbito-frontal cortex and in the basal
ganglia. Metabolism in these regions was negatively correlated with
the time period since last use of cocaine. In fact, increased

27

28

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

metabolic activity in the orbito-frontal cortex and basal ganglia
were not seen when patients were tested 2-5 weeks after last use
of cocaine, thus suggesting that the increase in metabolic activity
into the basal ganglia and orbito-frontal cortex was related to
cocaine withdrawal. Metabolic activity in these regions was also
positively correlated with the intensity of the craving. The fact that
these regions, orbito-frontal cortex and basal ganglia, have been
implicated in a circuit that involves repetitive and compulsive
patterns of behavior (Kolb 1977), suggests that one of the
mechanisms by which cocaine induces pathological self
administration may involve its ability to disrupt this circuit.
A second study was carried out to determine if brain metabolic
defects persisted after the early withdrawal from cocaine had
subsided (Volkow et al. submitted/a). For this study, a total of 20
chronic cocaine abusers were investigated 10 days to 2 months after
last use of cocaine.
Seven of these subjects were retested 3-4
months after a drug free period.
Patients were hospitalized and
maintained on a rehabilitation program for the entire length of the
study. The normal controls constituted 20 healthy volunteers who
were screened for the absence of psychopathology, neurological or
medical disease, and past or present history of cocaine abuse. The
study documented significant reductions in frontal metabolic
activity in cocaine abusers when compared with normal controls.
The decreases were larger for the left frontal cortex than for the
right frontal area and persisted when the subjects were retested 34 months after detoxification. The rate of decrease in metabolic
activity in the left frontal cortex was correlated with the intensity
of depressive symtoms as assessed by the Beck Depression
Inventory.
These studies show differences in brain metabolism between
normal controls and cocaine abusers and documents differential
brain metabolic changes for the early and late phases of cocaine
detoxification.
Cocaine abusers tested during the early phase of
cocaine withdrawal, showed increased metabolic activity into areas
connected with the dopamine system whereas cocaine abusers
tested in late withdrawal showed decrease metabolic activity in the
frontal cortex. Persistence of metabolic abnormalities even after 4
months of detoxification points to the long term deleterious actions
of cocaine in brain metabolism.
Positron emission tomography has also been utilized to
determine if there are changes in dopamine receptors secondary to
chronic cocaine use. This is relevant inasmuch as it has been
hypothesized that cocaine addiction may result from a decrease of

Section 1. Physiopathology

29

dopamine activity secondary to chronic use of cocaine (Dachis et al.
1985).
Studies measuring changes in dopamine receptors with
chronic cocaine are controversial, some authors report increases,
decreases, or no changes (For review Post et al. 1987). In order to
test this hypothesis, a study was done to measure the availability of
brain dopamine receptors with PET and F-18 N-methylspiroperidol.
The study was done in 10 chronic cocaine abusers, (7 were tested
within one week of last use of cocaine, and 3 were tested 2 to 4
weeks after cocaine withdrawal), and in a group of 10 normal
controls (Volkow et al. 1990a). This study documented decreases in
dopamine receptor availability in subjects who were tested within
one week of last cocaine use. In contrast, there was no evidence of
changes in dopamine receptors on the patients tested 2 to 4 weeks
of last use of cocaine. This study showed that chronic use of cocaine
leads to changes in dopamine receptors. The decrease in dopamine
receptor availability during the initial withdrawal may represent an
adaptation to the dopaminergic overstimulation secondary to chronic
use of cocaine.
With withdrawal, the receptor availability may
revert to values similar to those seen in normal controls. The extent
to which this occurs, however, can not be inferred from this
investigation due to the very small sample size of subjects tested
after the initial cocaine withdrawal.
c)
Pharmacokinetics: Carbon-11-labeled cocaine ([N-11C-methyl]
cocaine) has been used in conjunction with PET to measure the
behavior of cocaine in the human and baboon brain in vivo (Fowler et
al. 1989). The pattern of distribution of cocaine in the human brain
was heterogenous with maximal concentration occurring in the basal
ganglia which is the area with the highest density of dopamine
receptors in the human brain. In principle, the PET image of the brain
after C-11 cocaine could represent both the parent drug and labeled
metabolites. However, it is known that the principal labeled
metabolites of cocaine, 11C-benzoylecgonine and 11C-ecgonine
methyl ester, do not cross the blood-brain barrier and, therefore, the
PET image of the brain is cocaine itself.
Animal experiments carried out in baboon brain with PET to
characterize the pattern of binding of cocaine showed that cocaine
binds predom inantly to the dopamine transporters since
pretreatment with nomifensine, a drug that inhibits the dopamine
transporter selectively reduced cocaine binding into the basal
ganglia. In contrast, desipramine, a drug that binds to norepinephrine
and serotonin transporters, did not affect its binding. Even though
the highest concentration of cocaine was observed in the basal

30

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

ganglia, there were other brain areas that showed a significant
accumulation of cocaine.
In particular, the thalamus showed an
initial accumulation of cocaine as high as that in the basal ganglia.
However, its clearance from this region was faster than in the basal
ganglia.
With PET, one can measure both the regional distribution of a
compound on the brain and its changes with time, resulting in a
direct measurement of the pharmacokinetics of a drug in the brain.
Studies measuring the pharmacokinetics of 11C-cocaine showed a
very fast uptake of cocaine by the human brain.
Peak uptake
occurred 4-6 minutes after injection. This study also showed that
cocaine clears from the brain very rapidly and less than 50 percent
of the activity remains 20 minutes after injection. The pattern of
uptake and clearance of cocaine parallels the time changes in the
intensity of the euphoria experienced after intravenous cocaine.
This parallelism suggests that the kinetics of cocaine are important
in understanding its reinforcing effects.
A PET study designed to measure changes in distribution and
kinetics of cocaine in the brain secondary to chronic use of cocaine
was done in a group of 10 chronic cocaine abusers and 10 normal
controls (Volkow et al. unpublished data). This study showed that
chronic cocaine abusers had decreased uptake of carbon-11 cocaine
in the brain. These decreases were significantly lower in the basal
ganglia and in thalamus. Whether these changes represent decreases
in the dopamine transporters secondary to chronic use of cocaine or
to presynaptic dopamine neuron degeneration or whether they reflect
decreases in cerebral blood flow needs to be further investigated.
The whole body distribution of cocaine was investigated with
carbon-11 methylcocaine and PET to try to understand the
widespread toxicity of cocaine to the various organs of the body
(Volkow et al. submitted b)).
Of particular interest are the
cardiotoxic properties of cocaine since they account for a
considerable amount of the morbidity and mortality seen in cocaine
abusers (Huester 1987).
The mechanisms of cardiotoxicity from
cocaine have been related to both its central (Wilkerson 1988, Jones
Tackett 1990) and peripheral effects (Pitts 1989). Peripheral
mechanisms involve the release of catecholamines from the adrenals
(Chiueh Kopin, 1978; Nahas et al. 1991) as well as possible direct
interactions of cocaine with the cardiac tissue (Peng et al. 1989).
The extent to which cocaine accumulates in the human heart has not
been investigated in vivo. Postmortem studies have demonstrated
binding of cocaine to muscarinic receptors in myocardial tissue
(Sharkey et al. 1988). A PET study done on 10 normal controls

Section I. Physiopathology

measured the rate of uptake of carbon-11 cocaine in the human
heart. This study showed a similar absolute uptake of cocaine in the
heart to that in the brain (.01% of the injected dose per cc of tissue).
The kinetics of cocaine into the heart were faster than those seen in
the brain.
Maximal uptake was achieved 3 to 4 minutes after
injection; half-peak clearance was achieved by 10 minutes after
injection. Neither preadministration of desipramine nor of
benztropine affected the binding of cocaine in the heart. More work
is still required to characterize the pattern of cocaine binding in
myocardium.
However, the demonstration of significant
accumulation of cocaine into the human heart is of relevance since
it validates the possibility that cardiotoxicity from cocaine could be
related to the direct interaction of cocaine with the myocardial
cells. In addition, cocaine's local anesthetic properties could result
in depressant effects on excitable tissue and thus could account for
arrythmias and asystole (Przywara Dambach 1989).
Cocaine did not bind into the lungs and in this organ the
pattern of activity paralleled that of plasma. There was significant
accumulation of cocaine in the liver where the kinetics were much
slower than in any other organ. Peak uptake occurred 30 minutes
after injection and at that point it plateaued and remained stable for
the remaining of the study (45 minutes). The uptake of radioactivity
by the liver probably represents not only
carbon-11 cocaine but also its metabolites since at 30 minutes 60%
of the radioactivity represents cocaine metabolites and only 40%
represents the parent compound. Accumulation of cocaine was also
seen into the kidneys where the kinetics paralleled those seen in the
heart. Maximal uptake of cocaine in the human body was observed in
the adrenals. For this organ, the uptake per unit weight of tissue
was 5 times higher than that seen in the brain. The kinetics of
uptake, however, were similar to those of the brain and maximal
peak was achieved 6 to 8 minutes after injection and half-peak
clearance occurred by 20 minutes. The extremely high accumulation
of cocaine into the adrenals may be of relevance in accounting for
the massive release of catecholamines observed after acute cocaine
administration (Nahas et al. 1991). Even though the catecholamine
release from adrenals was related to its central effect, there is now
direct evidence that cocaine can interact directly with a chromaffin
cell to release norepinephrine (Chieuh Kopin, 1978). This, in turn, is
also of relevance in understanding the cardiotoxicity from cocaine.
In summary, these PET studies have been able to document
cerebral vascular toxicity secondary to cocaine, increases in
metabolic activity in basal ganglia and orbito-frontal cortex during

31

32

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

early cocaine withdrawal,
long-term decreases in regional brain metabolism after chronic use
of cocaine, as well as very fast kinetics for cocaine in brain that
may account for some of its reinforcing properties and high
accumulation of cocaine into various organs that could account for
its cardiotoxic and hepatotoxic properties.
Alcohol
Most of the work done with alcohol has involved the
investigation
of changes in the regional brain glucose
metabolism secondary to chronic use of alcohol. Of the four studies
reported, (Samson et al. 1986, Sachs et al. 1987, Wik et al. 1988,
Volkow et al. 1991c) three of these have documented evidence of
decrease whole brain metabolic activity in these patients. Although
regional patterns of defects reported by various investigators vary,
the most consistently reported as abnormal is the frontal cortex. In
addition, left hemispheric abnormalities have been reported with
more frequency than those of the right hemisphere.
Differences
among the investigators could reflect differences in population
investigated as well as differences in the period after alcohol
withdrawal at which the subjects were investigated. These issues
were addressed in a study done on 20 alcoholics that were
investigated 6-42 days after alcohol withdrawal (Volkow et al.
1991c).
This study showed that the decrease in whole brain
metabolic activity was correlated with the days since last alcohol
use. When normalizing for the effects of whole brain metabolism to
examine if there were areas of the brain more affected than others,
alcoholics were found to have significant lower frontal and left
parietal metabolism. These normalized changes in metabolism were
independent of the time period after alcohol withdrawal at which
subjects were investigated. Thus, these studies document the
existence of effects not only of alcohol withdrawal, but also long­
term changes in brain metabolism that may translate in dysfunction
of those regions affected.
Studies have also been done with PET to investigate the
effects of acute alcohol administration on regional brain glucose
metabolism. A study was done in 6 normal controls and 6 chronic
alcoholics who were tested under two conditions: one done under no
pharmacological intervention, and the second done after acute
administration of 1 g/kg of ethanol (Volkow et al. 1990b). This study
documented decreases in brain glucose metabolism after acute
alcohol administration.
The decreases in metabolism were

Section I. Physiopathology

heterogeneous, and the areas with the highest response to alcohol
were the areas which are known to have the highest density of
benzodiazepine receptors in the human brain. This study interpreted
the decrease in regional brain metabolism after ethanol as
reflecting an interaction of ethanol with the benzodiazepine-GABA
receptor system. For this study, alcoholics showed greater response
to the effects of ethanol relative to normal controls.
Despite the
larger reductions in brain glucose metabolism upon ethanol
administration, the alcoholics showed less subjective sense of
intoxication than that reported by the normal controls. This
paradoxical higher metabolic responsivity and decreased subjective
responsivity to the effects of ethanol may reflect tolerance of the
brain to decreased metabolism secondary to alcohol.
Since the
regional metabolic pattern of response to acute alcohol
administration correlated with the known concentration of
benzodiazepine receptors, the increased metabolic responsivity by
the alcoholics was interpreted as reflecting changes in the
benzodiazepine-GABA receptor system in chronic alcoholics. These
changes could be a result of chronic alcohol administration, of
alcohol withdrawal, or they could relate to genetic differences that
may predispose these individuals to alcoholism. Animal work has
demonstrated that chronic alcohol induces increased sensitivity in
the benzodiazepine GABA receptor system (Ticku 1983). Since the
mechanisms by which alcohol interacts with the benzodiazepine
GABA receptor system have not been delineated, the nature of
possible changes in the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor system could
not be clarified by this study. A second study was done in order to
address specifically the extent to which the benzodiazepine receptor
was abnormal in chronic alcoholics. This study was done in a group
of 15 normal controls and 10 chronic alcoholics (Volkow et al.
1991d). Subjects were tested with FDG to measure brain glucose
metabolism under two conditions. The first scan was done with no
pharmacological intervention, whereas the second scan was done 40
minutes after intravenous administration of the benzodiazepine
agonist lorazépam. Five of the normal controls received 1 mg of
lorazépam and the rest of the subjects received 30 p/kg of
lorazépam ( 2 mg). Both doses of lorazépam decreased regional brain
glucose metabolism. The magnitude of response was dose-related
and represented a 10% decrease for 1 mg, and 20% for the 2-mg dose.
The low dose of lorazépam produced a pattern of response similar to
that observed with alcohol. The maximal response was observed in
the occipital cortex and in the pre-frontal cortex. The high dose of
lorazépam induced a marked decrease in metabolic activity in the

33

34

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology , Detection

thalamus, which was not observed with alcohol nor with the lowdose of lorazepam. Surprisingly, the alcoholics showed much less
response than the normal controls to lorazepam administration. The
seeming inconsistency in the results observed in the studies done in
alcohol and those with lorazepam could be explained if, the site of
interaction of alcohol and benzodiazepine in the GABA receptor
complex is different. This possibility is supported by animal work
which has shown that for some paradigms the effects of alcohol and
benzodiazepines are not only different but sometimes even
antagonistic (Najim and Karim 1991).
Direct measurements of
benzodiazepine receptor concentration in human brain using ligands
to label the benzodiazepine receptors have been done with PET and
SPECT.
A preliminary study done with PET in three chronic
alcoholics reported decreases in benzodiazepine receptors in these
patients (Litton et al. 1991). The results were too preliminary to
draw any specific conclusions.
Marijuana
The effects of acute marijuana administration have been
investigated, both in normal controls and in chronic marijuana
abusers (Volkow et al. 1991e, Volkow unpublished data). These
studies were done using FDG to measure regional brain glucose
metabolism under two conditions: the first scan was done with no
pharmacological intervention, and the second scan was done 24 hrs
later, after the subjects have been given 2 mg i.v. of THC (the main
psychoactive component of marijuana). There was a very variable
response to THC, both with respect to the subjective effects of the
drug as well as the regional brain metabolic changes. Eleven of the
18 subjects reported the experience as pleasant, 3 became
extremely anxious and paranoid, and 4 reported minimal effect.
Seven of the subjects showed an increase of more than 10% in whole
brain metabolism, 5 showed more than a 10% decrease, and 6 showed
changes of less than 10% in whole brain metabolism. Despite this
wide variability in metabolic response, there was a consistent
increase in cerebellar metabolism observed both in the normal
controls as well as the chronic marijuana users.
The increased
metabolism in cerebellum correlated with the plasma concentration
of THC; individuals with the highest THC plasma levels showed the
highest cerebellar metabolic values. The intensity of the subjective
sense of intoxication after THC was also correlated with the
cerebellar metabolic activity. Comparisons between the normal and
marijuana abusers revealed that the marijuana abusers showed less

Section I. Physiopathology

of a cerebellar response upon THC administration than the normal
controls.
In addition, marijuana abusers also showed increased
metabolic activity in the prefrontal cortex after THC.
Prefrontal
cortex activation upon THC administration was not observed in the
normal controls.
Comparisons of the metabolic images obtained
during the baseline scan showed significantly lower cerebellar
metabolism in the marijuana abusers when compared with normal
controls. Thus, this study demonstrates that for THC the area of the
brain which is the most sensitive to the acute effects of marijuana
is also the one that is mostly affected under chronic conditions.
Marijuana appears to produce both immediate, as well as long-term
changes in cerebellar metabolism. The well- localized cerebellar
effects of marijuana correspond to the high density of cannabinoid
receptors reported in this area (Herkenham et al. 1990) and are
consistent with a direct interaction of THC with the cannabinoid
receptors. Other brain areas have been shown to contain cannabinoid
receptors such as the hippocampus, substantia nigra pars reticulata,
and the caudate nucleus. Because of the limited spatial resolution of
the PET instrument used in these studies, these regions could not be
measured in the present investigation. This PET study supports the
notion that the effect of marijuana in brain glucose metabolism is
mediated through its interaction with receptors, rather than through
diffuse non-specific effects by alteration of membrane function.
Similarly, this study documents deleterious effects of chronic
marijuana in brain function.
More specifically, marijuana abusers
showed evidence of decreased cerebellar activity.
This could
translate in disruptions in functions that are associated with the
cerebellum, such as motor-coordination, proprioception, and
learning. All the above cognitive processes have been shown to be
disrupted during acute marijuana intoxication (Roth et al. 1973,
Yesavage et al. 1985, Dornbush et al. 1971) and to be abnormal in
chronic marijuana users (Wig and Varma 1977, Mendhiratta et al.
1978, Varma et al. 1988).
Cerebellar disruption by THC could
explain these functional disturbances.
Attempts have also been made to label a THC analog to
measure its regional concentration in the baboon brain (Macrianik et
al. 1990). Unfortunately, because of the high lipophilicity of
marijuana, this study did not yield any particular regional pattern of
localization. The tracer was widely distributed in the brain with a
relatively higher concentration in the cerebellum.
However,
preadministration of pharmacological doses of THC failed to change
the regional pattern of binding, thus suggesting that the binding
corresponded to nonspecific binding of the tracer. Development of

THC ligands with higher affinity for the cannabinoid receptors may
make it feasible to measure the regional concentration of
cannabinoid receptors in vivo in the human brain.

Abstract
The purpose of this research was to develop a cognitive factors
research laboratory that could measure the subtle, carry-over effects of
various drugs such as marijuana and other factors such as aging on
psychomotor performance found in complex human-machine interaction. The
three experiments reviewed are a chronology of our efforts. The findings
reported indicate that marijuana impairs complex psychomotor performance
for up to 24 hours after smoking a low to moderate social dose. The results
also indicate that marijuana and other factors such as task difficulty and aging
act to cumulatively impair performance. These findings suggest that there
may be conditions under which real world complex human-machine
performance is significantly impaired with out the subjective awareness of the
marijuana user.

M arijuana Carry-Over Effects on Psychomotor Performance:
A Chronicle of Research.
This research had two purposes. First, we were interested in the
question of how long low to moderate social doses of marijuana affects
complex psychomotor performance.
Second, we were interested in
developing a more sensitive methodology to measure subtle effects of
marijuana and other drugs such as alcohol.
Our conceptual framework for this research included two central
ideas.
First, complex psychomotor performance found in most
human/machine interaction is largely a human information processing task
(1). Second, in any unit of time, humans have a limited capacity to
consciously process the encoded and recalled information used when
performing such tasks (2,3). In the terminology of cognitive psychology,
when there is an abundance of environmental input, complex human/machine
performance is limited by cognitive capacity rather than the availability of
information (4,5). Finally, within this framework, previous empirical findings
show that one of marijuana’s acute effects is to further reduce humans*
capacity to process information (6,7).
We began this research believing there were several problems with
existing laboratory measures of complex psychomotor performance. First
they did not collect enough data at a fast enough rate to capture transient,
subtle effects of marijuana that might occur several hours after ingestion.
Human information processing is occurring at the millisecond level with
important human/machine interactions occurring more frequently than one
time per second (1). Thus, we reasoned that a sensitive measure of
psychomotor performance should be sampled more frequently than once per
second.
A second suspected problem with existing approaches was that
subjects could effectively compensate for impairment by strategically
allocating their cognitive resources (2,8) to just those two or three
simultaneous tasks that the experiment required them to perform (4). I n
order to prevent compensation, we thought that the psychomotor task should
be complex and require the subject to simultaneously perform as many tasks
as possible and that these tasks should include different sensory inputs, i.e.,
visual, auditory, and tactile. In other words, we wanted to insure that the
subject’s would not hold any extra processing capacity in reserve. Under this
condition, if marijuana impairs their processing capacity, it will be expressed
as measurable performance decline rather than an unmeasurable increase in
the pilot’s level of effort.
We believed a third problem was that most laboratory measures
lacked face validity and public understanding. The laboratory findings that
existed were not easily communicated to even sophisticated lay audiences.
For example, the public has a hard time understanding the relationship

TH C ligands with higher affinity for the cannabinoid receptors may make

concentration of cannabinoid receptors in vivo in the human brain.

between a divided attention task such as target tracking on a CRT while
monitoring for other events such as blinking lights (9,10,11) and the possible
psychomotor impairment of a heavy equipment operator who smokes
marijuana after work. Thus, to effectively communicate basic research
findings to the public it would be ideal to use a psychomotor task that
simulates non-trivial, real world tasks.
A fourth related problem was that the existing psychomotor tests that
did have high face validity were considerably less sensitive than typical
laboratory measures and, therefore, we believed they failed to show
significant impairment except immediately after smoking large doses of
marijuana. Examples include an early aviation piloting experiment (12)
employed a paper and penile checklist rating of performance. These tasks
were collecting only one or two data points every several seconds or minutes.
We believed that these measurement problems lead to many non­
significant effects and in turn lead many scientists and laymen alike to
suspect that moderate social doses of marijuana had little or no impact on
psychomotor performance with only a one or two hour delay after smoking.
To address these concerns and shortcomings, we selected simulated
aircraft piloting as a psychomotor task for investigating marijuana carry-over
effects. Piloting is a non-trivial, real world task. It is also a complex
psychomotor task that can be systematically manipulated in experiments using
modem, computer-controlled, realistic aircraft simulators. These aircraft
simulators allow for the collection of a large number of data points at
sampling rates greater than one time per second. For example, the simulator
we used in our final two experiments collects data on 52 variables at about
22 times per second. Finally, while piloting is a complex psychomotor task
requiring considerable skills and experience, there is an abundance of well
trained pilots available to act as subjects in experiments.
The three experiments reviewed here are a chronicle of our efforts
to develop a research laboratory and an experimental paradigm that can be
used to measure and study both immediate as well as longer term carry-over
effects of marijuana and other drugs such as alcohol.
Experiment One. Carry-Over Effects of M arijuana Intoxication on
Aircraft Pilot Performance: A Preliminary Report
In 1985 Jerome Yesavage, Leo Hollister, Mark Denari, and I (13)
published our first findings using what would be considered by our current
standards, a very primitive computerized aircraft simulator. This simulator
consisted of a control yoke similar to those found in small aircraft, a black
and white CRT used to display the simulated environment in which the pilot
flies, and a computer keyboard to allow the pilots to regulate simulated
aircraft’s power settings and flaps (see Figure 1). This simulator was
controlled by an Apple II (6502 cpu) computer which allowed us to collect

49

51

Section / . Physiopathology

data on eight variables at about once every 500 msec. One important feature
of this primitive simulator which we were to recognize later was that there
was a lag time of about one second between the time the pilot made a flight
correction (i.e., operated the yoke or keyboard) and the simulator’s response
to the correction. While pilots complained that this made the simulator very
difficult to fly, the limits of the technology made it impossible for us to
correct the problem.
In this first experiment, pilots first practiced for eight hours on the
piloting task that would be used in the actual experiment. This piloting task
consisted of a simple simulated flight Pilots first took off at one airport,
climbed to 700 feet, made a small course correction, and then descended and
landed at a second airport. Because of restrictions on our data collection
capabilities, performance data was gathered primarily on the last part of the
flight which includes descent and landing. On the day of the experiment,
pilots first flew two practice flights and then a test flight to establish a base
rate of non-drug performance. They then smoked a 19mg dose of THC delta
9 and after a one, four, and 24 hour delay, flew the same route.

From Yesavage, Leirer, Denari, and Hollister, 1985
As shown in Table 1 above, an analysis of these findings revealed
that at 24 hours after smoking, on five of the eight variables measured, pilots
were still not performing at the level they had previous to their smoking the
19mg of THC delta 9.
We classified this study as a preliminary report because it lacked
many of the experimental controls to permit confidence in the findings. The
study also failed to give us any idea of when we would no longer detect an
effect of the drug. With these reservations in mind, we considered this first
experiment suggestive evidence that the carry-over effects of moderate to low

52

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology , Detection

social doses of marijuana may last many hours longer than the previous body
of research suggested.
The findings also suggested that this new
methodology might indeed provide a much more sensitive measure of drug
impairment and that we would be able to study the psychomotor impairment
of different drugs even when these effects are subtle and small in magnitude.

Experiment Two: Marijuana, Aging, and Task Difficulty
Effects on Pilot Performance,
With the experience gained from our first experiment and with the
advent of new technology in aircraft simulators, Jerome Yesavage, Daniel
Morrow, and I (14) were able to construct a much more sophisticated and
realistic flight simulator and research laboratory. This new simulator used
a Silicon Graphics Computer to generate color visual displays of the
simulated environment and a Frasca 141 computer-controlled aircraft
simulator. The Frasca 141 simulator included a realistic small aircraft
cockpit with a full compliment of flight instrumentation (see Figure 2 on next
page). With this simulator we were able to collect data on 52 different
variables at approximately 22 times per second. Our pilots liked the
simulator and thought it was realistic in most aspects of flight. With this
new laboratory, we began a more systematic and multifaceted study of the
effects of marijuana on complex psychomotor performance.
In addition to studying the time course of the drug effects, we
wanted to study the possibility that other factors combine with marijuana to
jointly influence performance. Specifically, we wanted to investigate any
possible cumulative effects of marijuana, aging, and task difficulty on
psychomotor performance. If limited processing capacity is the source of
impairment, we should find best performance in the condition of a placebo
dose of marijuana smoked by young pilots, performing our easiest piloting
tasks. Impairment should increase as we add factors that either reduce
processing capacity (increased drug dose or increased pilot age) or increase
demands on processing capacity by increasing task difficulty (increasing
weather turbulence). Thus, in the condition of highest task difficulty, highest
drug dose, and older pilots we should see the greatest performance
decrement.
To investigate these possibilities we trained nine young pilots (Mean
age=25.5) and nine old pilots (Mean age 37.6) on a simulated flight that
included the following set of standard maneuvers while flying a rectangular
flight pattern around the runway: a) take-off, b) climbing turn, departure stall,
c) slow flight, d) approach stall, e) standard rate turn, d) base leg approach
to landing that involved straight and level flying, e) final leg approach to
landing, f) descent to landing, and g) landing. Each of these components
included specific and realistic instructions for air speed, heading, altitude, and
rate of turns. Thus, pilots were asked to perform as closely to the ideal of

Section I. Physiopathology

53

54

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology , Detection

the flight instructions as possible. During the eight hours of pre-experiment
training, pilots were given feedback after each flight about their deviations
from the ideal flight. This was accomplished by showing the pilots
numerical performance scores and a three dimensional display of their flight
path that was superimposed on a display of the ideal flight path. This display
was generated on the Silicon Graphics Computer monitor.
After training was completed, pilots participated in three drug dose
sessions, each occurring over a three day period. In each of these sessions
the pilots smoked either a ) Placebo, b) 10 mg THC delta 9, and 20 mg THC
delta 9 cigarette. On the first day of each session, pilots began the
experiment by completing two practice flights as described above. Next, they
smoked a cigarette containing one of the three drug dose levels. Then one,
four, and eight hours after smoking, they flew the above described flight
pattern under calm weather simulation and a second flight under mildly
turbulent weather conditions. They then returned to the laboratory the next
day (24 hours after smoking) to fly two practice flights and then a calm and
turbulent experimental flight pair. They returned again on the third and final
day (48 hours after smoking) to fly two practice flights and then a calm and
turbulent experimental flight pair. To summarize the experimental design,
young and old pilots flew in calm and moderately turbulent weather, at 1, 4,
8, 24, and 48 after smoking a placebo, lOmg, and 20mg THC delta 9
cigarette.
This experiment investigated two related questions: a) how long are
the drug’s carry-over effects, and b) are there cumulative effects of marijuana
use, task difficulty, and age of drug user. To measure "performance", we
created a single dependent measure by standardizing difference-from-idealperformance scores for each variable across subjects and experimental
conditions. This allowed us to create a single, equally weighted aggregate
score for each subject in each experimental condition.
As expected the results indicated an effect of age of pilot (older
pilots performed less well than younger pilots), an effect of task difficulty
(calm weather performance was better than turbulent weather), and an effect
of time after smoking (the drug effect decreased over time). These findings
are shown in Table 2 below.
The results included an unexpected finding. We did not replicate the
24 hour carry-over effects of our first experiment Looking at performance
in the high dose condition, we found no evidence of impairment beyond a
four hour delay. In the low dose condition we found no evidence of
impairment even one hour after smoking. After careful consideration of this
failure to replicate, we could only guess that it was the result of improving
the realism of the simulator and thereby making it an easier task for the pilots
to perform. Related to this, we suspected that the unavoidable delays in the
responsiveness of the simulator used in Experiment One made the task
significantly more difficult than the task used in this experiment.

From Leirer, Yesavage, and Morrow (1988)
Findings about cumulative impairment were more encouraging.
Looking only at the one hour time point after smoking, we found the
predicted pattern of cumulative effects. Young pilots, smoking placebo dose,
in calm weather showed the least performance decrements. As shown in
Figure 3 below, performance decrements condnued to increase until we get
to the condidon of older pilots in turbulent weather under the high dose
condidon, who show the greatest performance decrements.
These cumulative effects predict the following type of real world
scenario. When operating complex equipment under routine conditions,
marijuana smokers may find that they perform adequately only a few hours
after smoking. This in turn leads them to mistakenly believe that they are
acting responsibly by leaving a few hours between smoking marijuana and
performing some complex psychomotor task at work. Then because of some
unusual circumstance or emergency, they are required to perform an
unusually difficult psychomotor task. Our findings suggest that at certain
levels of increased task difficulty, they would have been able to deal with the

56

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology , Detection

emergency had it not been for the cumulative impact of both increased task
difficulty and marijuana carry-over effects. This sort of scenario might be
expected to occur in complex divided attention tasks such as automobile
driving, aircraft flying, boat navigation, or heavy equipment operation when
unusually severe conditions such as accident avoidance, or adverse weather
occur.

Experiment Three: Marijuana Carry-Over Effects on
Aircraft Pilot Performance,
With our failure in Experiment Two to replicate the 24 carry-over
effects of Experiment One, Jerome Yesavage, Daniel Morrow, and I (15)
designed and conducted a third experiment specifically to investigate the
question of 24 hour carry-over effects using the new, more realistic aircraft
simulator. As suggested above, we suspected that the new more realistic
simulator inadvertently made the task too easy to detect impairment more
than a few hours after smoking a moderate social dose of marijuana. If this
was the case, then by keeping the realistic simulator but making the piloting
task more difficult, we should be able to again detect 24 hour carry-over
effects.
To test this hypothesis, we used the same rectangular flight pattern
as before with the same flight maneuvers. We added to this task radio

57

Section I. Physiopathology

communication with a simulated air traffic controller, visual detection and
avoidance of approaching aircraft, and engine failure and correction. We also
increased the weather turbulence. And finally, we reduced the amount of
practice time so that the task would not become over learned. This created
a very difficult though realistic flying task. (It very much reminded me of
routine flying in the San Francisco Bay area.) We reduced the number of
conditions in this experiment to include only a placebo and a 20mg THC
delta 9 dose conditions, and a single high turbulent weather condition.

From Leirer, Yesavage, and Morrow (1991)
On the first day of the experiment, pilots flew two practice flights
and then flew two experimental flights to establish their base rate
performance level. Next, they smoked either a placebo cigarette or a 20mg
dose cigarette. Fifteen minutes, four hours, and eight hours, 24 hours, and
48 hours after smoking they flew two flights using the same procedure as
described in Experiment 2. Thus, each pilot flew these six sessions under a
placebo and a 20mg dose condition. We compared each pilot’s performance
in the 20mg dose condition to this placebo dose condition at each of the six
time points.
As reported in Table 3 above and graphically shown in Figure 4 on
the following page, we found significant increases in impairment at 15
minutes, 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours after smoking the 20mg dose. Thus,
the findings replicated the 24 hour carry over effects first reported in
Experiment One. At 48 hours after smoking, we found no indication of
impairment.

Discussion
The findings from these three experiments suggest a number of
points about the carry-over effects of a low to moderate social dose of
marijuana on complex psychomotor performance. The first point is that after
about four hours, a low to moderate dose produces effects that are relatively
subtle and difficult to measure. However, I do believe that our findings
indicate that impairment does exist as long as 24 hours after smoking a
moderate social dose of marijuana.
The second point is that real world psychomotor tasks most likely
affected by this long term carry-over will be those requiring divided attention
extending over several minutes or hours and that require all of the person’s
available cognitive capacity. For example, while I do not think there would
be any measurable impairment to a street sweeper’s performance 24 hours
after smoking certain types of heavy equipment operations, some medical
procedures, and so forth may very well be impaired.
The third point is that the effects of a low to moderate social dose
at several hours after smoking are so subtle that users do not realize they
exist and therefore cannot depend their own self judgment to know they are
not performing as well a normal. This point is supported by our finding that
only one of the pilots in Experiment Three indicated that he felt any
awareness of the drug effect at 24 hours after smoking.
The final related point is that effects of one low to moderate social
dose of marijuana after 4 or so hours will show up as a statistical increase in
error or accident rates. It is unlikely that the individual users at risk for such
accidents will ever realize the impact of marijuana on their performance.
This lack of awareness is the result of little or no subjective experience of the
drugs effect and the fact that the increase in the individual’s base rate of
recognizable errors or accidents will be too low to detect.
I would like to conclude by discussing the time investment required
to investigate these more subtle effects. Cognitive factors research such as
this requires first developing and validating a computerized laboratory. It is
reasonable to expect to spend three to five years developing effective
apparatus and procedures. Prior research demonstrates that standard divided
attention tasks are not sensitive enough to detect these effects. However,
once the time investment is made, a laboratory such as ours can be used for
a number of different research topics. For example, we have used the same
equipment and procedures to investigate other drugs such as alcohol as well
as impact of aging on complex psychomotor performance.

Short-term Memory Study: Conclusions
1. Chronic cannabis use impairs short-term memory in teenagers
2. Short-term memory may remain intact in some individuals
3. Exceptionally gifted heavy marihuana smokers are less affected
while the learning disabled and those with low I.Q. have major
short-term memory problems from use of marihuana

Real-Life Correlates of Marihuana-induced Short-term
Memory Impairment
1. Tart, C. T.: Marihuana intoxication: Nature 226, 701-704(1979).
In 1970. Tart surveyed 150 university students:
59% were concerned about forgettung content of conversations.
41% answered positive to: if I read while smoking cannabis,
I remember less (than when I am sober).
2. Hendin, H. et al.: Living high. Human sciences press. New York, 1987.
Surveyed 150 adults who smoked cannabis daily.
A. 65% noted impaired memory as the most bothersome long-term
effect of their use of cannabis.
B. 45% noted impaired ability to:
a. concentrate on complex tasks
b. think clearly
c. get things done

Freebase, Cocaine and Memory
Despite the seriousness of acute medical and psychological consequences
of cocaine abuse, little knowledge exists about the chronic effects of the
drug. Investigation of a sample of abstinent freebase (crack) abusers in the
Bahamas provides the first research evidence that prolonged cocaine
abuse may result in persistent short-term memory disturbances.

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

While alcohol abuse among victims of traum atic insults has been well
docum ented,18little is know n about m arijuana use by traum a victims
proxim ate to the tim e of injury. In the few large series repo rted ,
confirm ation of such use involved victims of vehicular crashes. These
studies did not reflect the overall use of m arijuana because they limited
th eir scope to studying only those who died 9’11o r those agreed to be
tested.12
No previous prospective study has m easured m arijuana use in a large
population of vehicular and nonvehicular traum a victims. The purpose of
this prospective study was to determine the use of m arijuana proximal to
the time of injury in approximately 1000 traum a victims and to relate that
use to a num ber of other factors.
Radioimmunoassay (RIA) tests for 5-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (0-9-THC),
the mqjor psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, allow for documentation
of m ariju an a use proxim al to the tim e of injury. U rine tests for
cannabinoid metabolites cannot be used to ascertain such a relationship,
because such tests yield positive results four to ten days after smoking
m ariju an a and for as m any as 36 days after cessation in chronic
u sers. 13’14In contrast, the RIA test for serum 0-9-THC activity is not
positive for such activity four horns after stopping m arijuana use.15
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All trau m a victim s adm itted from the scene of injury to the Shock
Traum a Center of the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services
System s, B altim ore, betw een Ju ly 29, 1985 and May 8, 1986, w ere
cand id ates for the study. This dem ographic study was designed to
docum ent m arijuana and alcohol use among traum a victims.
P rior to testing for m arihuana use, the following data were collected:
age (< 30 years; >30 years), sex, m echanism of injury (vehicular and
nonvehicular), Injury Severity Score (ISS),16and blood alcohol level (BAL)
(0, <99, >100 mg/dl).
The ISS was designed to m easure and com pare degrees of injury
among blunt traum a victims. For ISS, the body is divided into six regions.
E ach injury is assigned a num ber from 1 ("minor") to 6 ("maximum
injury virtually unsurvivable") th at reflects degree of injury from the
abbreviated injury scale.17To derive an ISS, the highest score from the
three m ost severely injured regions are squared and then added. (One
investigator (CA.S.) determ ined all ISSs).
A fter d ata collection, a serum sam ple was tested for 0-9-THC. The
serum sam ple was a leftover (usually discarded) from venous blood
sam ples for routine admission diagnostic studies. In no case was serum
draw n for the sole purpose of testing for 0-9-THC. before testing, specimen
tubes w ere assigned new identifiers in a random fashion; all previous
identifiers w ere removed and discarded. Approximately 200 specimens
were subm itted for testing at one time to one of the investigators (AL.T.).
Patient confidentiality was protected by (1) selecting broad demographic
and clinical data set points and (2) "blinding" patient identifiers to 0-9-

HISTORICAL OUTLOOK OF THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
OF CANNABIS.
Gabriel Nahas.
New York U niversity, School of Medicine, New York, USA &
Laboratoire de Pharmacologie e t Toxicologie C ellulaires, P aris, France.

Throughout recorded history in the past 2,000 years, the use of C a n n a bis has
been associated with mental disturbances ranging from distorted perceptions to
hallucinations to dementia (Table 1). (By contrast, the use of opiates, including
that of heroin, has been rarefy associated in the literature with similar mental
pathology).
It is clear from the observations of Moreau and of
the French Romantics, and from the experiences of Taylor (1849) and Ludlow
(1857), that ingestion of C annabis extracts might precipitate episodes of acute
mental confusion reminiscent of an acute brain syndrome.
Moreau mentions only one acute psychotic episode among his associates who
had taken hashish; all the others kept their self-awareness and their consciousness
while being transported in the fantastic world created by the drug. They did not
choose to use C a n n a bis as a pleasure-inducing substance, but as a method to
explore mental pathology. None of them absorbed the drug over a prolonged time
and on a regular basis, and its chronic effect on mental function could not be
assessed. However, Moreau mentions that “one of the determining causes of insanity
among the Orientals is the excessive use of hashish” and that large amounts of the
drug could readily induce a true psychotic episode “for a period of time which
cannot be foreseen.”
The widespread use of C a n n a bis extracts in the nineteenth century for therapeutic
purposes, in Europe and the United States, was not accompanied by any report of
adverse acute or chronic mental reactions.
Until recently, the only reports of the adverse effects of C annabis on mental
functions came from India, the Middle East, or Africa. Such adverse reactions
have been described with increasing frequency over the past 25 years, as C a n n a bis
intoxication has appeared on the American scene. They resemble those described
earlier in the older literature.
Furthermore, the syndrome of mental and physical deterioration first reported
by Moreau (1845) and attributed to chronic Cannabis intoxication, and confirmed
by Chopra (1969), Miras (1969), and Benabud (1957), has now been reported in
the United States (McGlothlin and West, 1968).

PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF 104 PSYCHIATRIC CASES
ASSOCIATED WITH CANNABIS USE IN A
MOROCCAN MEDICAL CENTER
Taieb Chkili and J.E. Ktiouet
Departm ent o f Psychiatry, Rabat-Salé M edical Center
Rabat, Morocco

ABSTRACT
104 male patients admitted to the psychiatric ward of the
Rabat-Salé Medical Center had smoked cannabis before their
hospitalization. They were mostly unemployed, between 20 and 30
years of age. They were all treated with phenothiazenes or
butyrophenones. 44 patients presented a progressive and structured
psychopathology, from schizophrenic-like to paranoiac psychosis,
lasting from 14 days to 7 months. In these cases cannabis use might
have triggered an underlying psychosis. 60 patients presented acute
undifferentiated psychiatric
symptoms,
mostly
"acute
toxic
psychosis" which lasted less than 2 weeks. This prospective study
does not permit the definition of a specific "cannabis psychosis."

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

INTRODUCTION
The use of "kif", the local name for Cannabis Sativa is very
ancient in Morocco, where it was brought by the Arab conquerors
around the tenth century. Its consumption by the local population has
been previously associated with admission of patients to the
Berrechid Psychiatric Hospital for Psychiatric Disorders (Benabud
1957; Christozov 1965). The present study is based on the case
studies of 104 patients admitted to the psychiatric unit of the
Rabat-Sale Medical Center, and who had consumed cannabis before
their psychiatric symptomatology developed.
PATIENT POPULATION
All patients are males 18 to 58 years old, mostly clustered
between 21 and 30 years of age. Half of them are city dwellers
(Rabat-Salé), and half of them come from the countryside. They
belong to the poorer, destitute working class. The younger ones came
from large families. The majority have little education beyond 6th
grade, and a few have gone to college. Most of them are unemployed,
or occupied at menial part-time tasks.
Most started consuming cannabis between 10 and 20 years of
age, and were initiated into smoking by a group of their peers. Half
of the patients cannot give any reason for starting smoking. Among
reasons given by the other half of the sample are: a need to escape
and forget family problems, a way of obtaining pleasure, well-being
and euphoria, a remedy to anxiety, a way of dissipating loneliness.
Two-thirds of the sample smoked only cannabis on a daily
basis, one third used other drugs, mostly alcohol or prescription
drugs such as barbiturates. The duration of consumption for 3/4 of
the sample did not exceed ten years.
RESULTS
All patients studied reported cannabis consumption before the
appearance
of their psychotic
symptoms. The
length
of
hospitalization is summarized in Table I. All patients were treated
with phenothiazines or butyrophenones. In 67%
of cases,
hospitalization lasted less than a month. However, in 32% of cases,
it lasted for 1 to 7 months in spite of the pharmacological
treatm en t.

some length before presenting their psychiatic symptoms, present a
progressive and "structured" psychopathology, from schizophrenic­
like to paranoiac psychosis, displaying the classical progression

described for these conditions. This has led us to believe that
cannabis, as a toxic agent, has revealed a latent preexisting
pathology. The drug appears to act as a precipitating factor, which
triggers the underlying disease. But we do not believe that one can
refer to a pathology which is specific to cannabis.
The second group of 60 patients is characterized by poorly
defined psychiatric symptoms, except for the cases of "acute toxic
psychosis" which closely follow episodes of cannabis consumption.
These cases are indistinguishable from other acute toxic psychosis
associated with ingestion of psychoactive drugs.
In conclusion, this prospective study does not permit us to
define the existence of a "cannabis psychosis" presenting specific
featu res.

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

E X T E N T O F U S E AM O N G S C H IZ O P H R E N IC S

Cannabis is still the most widely used illicit drug throughout the world,
and in spite of the legal control measure in force, it continues to be readily available in
the industrialized societies of the West. Recent surveys of use in the general population
of North America yield lifetime prevalence rates of 33% in the USA (pop. aged 12+,
1988) and 23.2% in Canada (pop. aged 15 years+, 1989). The prevalence of active
users (the year of the survey) is highest in the age bracket 18 to 25 years: 35.4% in the
USA and 20.7% in Canada1’1.
With the advent of modem psychiatric treatment approaches, most
chronic psychotic patients no longer stay within institutionnal care but spend much of
their lives in the community. Consequently, in recent years they have been more
exposed to - and have had a greater opportunity to engage in - society’s prevailing drug
habits. This is certainly the case with ambulatory schizophrenics, who have been found
to make use of cannabis in frequencies as high or higher than the population at large.
The evidence from several North American surveys indicates that cannabis and alcohol
are the psychoactive substances most frequently misused by schizophrenics, at least
those registered with treatment programs in larger urban centres. Meuser et al.3, for
instance, administered structured interviews (SADS/SCID) to a sample such patients,
and found that 42 % of them had abused cannabis some time in their lives, while a
sizeable 22% could be defined as current abusers at the time of the inquiry. The age
range sample was 18-56; younger schizophrenics have been found to present current
abuse figures considerably higher ; particularly when the information is provide not by
the subjects themselves, but by well informed case-managers4.
Different explanations have been given to the apparent proclivity
schizophrenics show towards the non-medical use of psychoactive substances ; some of
them, of course, apply also to drug users in general, regardless of their psychiatric
status. One such interpretation: drug use as an instrument of socialization, is clearly
not exclusive to schizophrenics and may be reason many people engage in such habits.
However, given the extremely limited social interaction abilities of many of the chronic
patients, the act of seeking company to use and share drugs may well be one of the few
collective activities they remain capable of. Drug use with peers must consequently be
seen as a main pattern of social relation among the homeless schizophrenics, and in
the low rental housing areas of the city, where these impoverished, alienated and
rather withdrawn individuals tend to congregate.
Dixon et al.5 studies patterns of cannabis use among schizophrenics and
found that a significant number did so "usually" or "always" in the company of other
people. On the other hand, one third of users asserted that they were "always" alone
when smoking the drug. Thus, it seems that cannabism is a practice which appeals to
both the socially withdrawn and the less isolated schizophrenic. The widespread
availability of the drug, and its relatively low cost are features which may facilitate
access even to the more exclusive patients; those who are unable or unwilling to join in
cannabis smoking gatherings. By contrast, nearly all the schizophrenics who used
cocaine reported doing it "with others". This less accessible habit, which was found to
involve a smaller percentage of patients, is certainly more likely among schizophrenics
who remain socially engaged; those who muster the higher levels of interactional skills
and the psychic energy which are required to pursue it.
Another frequently mentioned reason for substance abuse among
schizophrenics is the need that many of these patients experience to "self-medicate".
That is, to alter the unpleasant subjective states caused by the illness itself, or by the
undesirable effects of pharmacotherapy. Anhedonia, apthy, inner tension, anxiety,
restlessness, insomnia, hallucinatory activity, are among the symptoms - mostly
"negative" ones - or side effects schizophrenics are thought to seek to relieve through

Section /. Physiopathology

107

the use of drugs6,7. The actual effects of cannabis on such discomfort do not appear to
have been clearly elucidated as yet.
Nonetheless, the Dixon et al.5 survey did demonstrate that
schizophrenics consistently agree in their description of what this drug does for them.
Cannabis - the patient asserted - decreased their anxiety, lifted their "depression",
rendered them "calmer", and gave them more "energy". On the other hand, those
experiencing suspiciousness and lack of trust were adversely affected, as the drug
served to enhance those symptoms. Such a combination of positive and negative
effects suggests that - with respect to cannabis at least - the self-medication hypothesis
is unlikely to explain the drug-seeking behaviour of all types of schizophrenics; or even
that of a single individual throughout all stages of the illness. Of course, it is also
possible that many schizophrenics take the drug in spite of the occurrence o f some
unwanted effects: for they also experience the beneficial ones, and are prepared to
endure the former in order to enjoy the latter.
The survey data available at present does not adequately cover the
schizophrenics’ longitudinal history of cannabis use. It is not possible, for instance, to
ascertain whether these patients go through changes in their attitude towards drug use
over the course of their illness. However, in a sample we studies in Montreal, it was
observed that the majority of patients who did start using cannabis in their youth, had
already ceased the habit by the time they reached the age of 30 years (see Fig. 1). This
is of course a tendency observed in the general population as well, but the rate o f
quitting among the schizophrenics is considerably higher (age corrected ratio o f past
to current users in the group of schizophrenics 7.2:1 vs 2.7:1 in the general
population). Indeed, the comparative profile displayed in Fig. 1 indicates that while a
significantly larger proportion of the schizophrenics were using the drug at a younger
age, the rate of active users past the age of 30 years is quite similar to that observed in
the population at large.
If the observations made on the Montreal sample were to apply to
schizophrenics at large, then some general explanation must be found. The finding
could be tentatively interpreted as follows: a) The schizophrenics, more than the
general population, are forced to abandon the habit because of proverty and the loss o f
social connections, b) Cannabis use makes some unpleasant symptoms worse,
(suspiciousness, paranoid feelings) and consequently exert a negative reinforcement
effect, c) The progression of the illness causes the schizophrenic to become less and
less responsive to the drug and leads to the extinction o f the desire for it (no reward, no
positive reinforcement).

EFFECTS ON THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA
Cannabis use has been linked with a number of occurences which, by and
large, lead to conclude that this drug has an adverse effect on schizophrenia. Both the
manifestations and the course of the illness appear to be negatively affected by such a
practice.
Precipitating Factor
Data gathered through both clinical and epidemiological studies
consistently suggest the probability that cannabis could act as a trigger, prompting the
overt expression of schizophrenia in individuals who suffer the basic
pathophysiological anomalies. In some such individuals - those observations implythe disease may have remained limited to a " sub clinical" derangement, with only
minor behavioural manifestations, were it not for the enhancing action of the
cannabinoids.

The evidence supporting this assumption derives from several separate
and independent studies:
- a prospective epidemiological survey of a large cohort o f men in Sweden
(see paper by P. ALLEBECK in this volume), which demonstrated that
individuals who are frequent users by age 20 years, present 6 times the
risk of developing schizophrenia in the course o f the subsequent
15 years, when compared with those who do not use cannabis at all.
- various studies which have consistently elicited a younger age o f onset o f
schizophrenia in patients who are cannabis users when compared with
those who are not®’9.
- comparative clinical research which found that cannabis using
schizophrenics tend to start the illness more suddenly - in the form of a
clearcut psychotic outbreak - without the premorbid personality changes
frequently observed in non-user counterparts10,11.
Worsening of symptoms
A number of clinical reports have identified cannabis as a drug capable o f
enhancing symptoms and increasing the level of behavioural disturbance in
schizophrenic patients. Cannabis use has also been blamed in instances o f symptom
recurrence in individuals whose illness had improved or even remitted. Rottamburg et
al.12, for example, observed higher levels of psychomotor agitation, and
BERHARDSON & GUNNE10 noted unusually aggressive and destrutive behaviour.
Other authors13,14 have published case reports with examples o f relapse following
renewed exposure to the drug.
In two separate surveys of large clinical samples4,5 it was found that the
patients themselves are aware of the negative effects of cannabis on paranoid
symptoms. A majority of the respondents who suffer from paranoid schizophrenia
report that cannabis makes them feel worse.
Our own study in Montreal, which involved a sample o f
137 schizophrenics in ambulatory care15, established that the subjects who were using
cannabis during the six month observation period, did display a higher level o f
delusional and hallucinatory activity than those who were not. Not surprisingly,
cannabis using schizophrenics were also the ones who necessitated more active care,
as indicated by the higher average number of visits they made to the hospital during
that period. Table I presents the results of a multiple regression analysis; it
demonstrates that cannabis use, more than other relevant factors, explains the
variance in symptom severity within the group studied. These data concern a
subsample of younger schizophrenics only (age 30 years or less, n = 52), for it was that
age group which proved to be most exposed to drug use.
The observations recorded to the present appear to indicate that cannabis
effects the "positive" symptoms of schizophrenia rather specifically. The worsening of
"deficit" problems such as lethargy autism, anhedonia and social withdrawal either
does not occur or cannot be noted as readily. Current knowledge about the
mechanisms whereby cannabis exerts its action in the brain is still limited. The
existence of a cannabinoid receptor has recently reported16; it appears that a synthetic
analog (CP55940) does in fact bind quite specifically in certain brain structures. This
analog, however, was developed from a sectionof the cannabinoid molecule only; it is
not certain at all that Tetrahydrocannabinol itself would behave in a similar way. Even
if it did, there is no evidence that this particular receptor binding function is linked

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology , Detection

no

with the psychoactive effects of the drug, for the molecular component which led to the
synthesis of CP55940 appears to have analgesic properties only. The adverse effects of
cannabis on the symptoms of schizophrenia are more likely to be due to an interference
in central neurotransmission17.

Adapted from NEGRETE, et al. (1986)

Present thinking on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia explains the
development of "positive" symptoms on the basis of a state of excessive dopaminergic
activity17’18. "Negative" symptoms, on the other hand, are believed to result from a
dopaminergic deficit in the prefrontal cortex18, or from cholinergic hyperactivity19. A
balance between cholinergic and dopaminergic functions is of central importance in
the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. These two neurotransmitter systems are known
to exert a moderating effect on one another: a lowering of dopaminergic activity causes
the cholinergic one to increase, and vice-versa. Positive symptoms could then be
caused by a surge in Dopamine function; either spontaneous, or provoked by the effect
of an exogenous dopamine agonist. They could also result from a decrease in central
cholinergic activity. Both these mechanisms are possible in the case of cannabis, for
this drug has been found to inhibit Acetylcoline turnover, increase Dopamine content
in the corpus striatum and enhance brain reward responses, which are usually
associated with an increased Dopamine afflux in the Limbic system1,20. Although the
dopaminergic hyperactivity hypothesis provides a coherent pathophysiology model for
both schizophrenia and some features of the cannabis intoxication21, this is unlikely to
be the only underlying mechanism. Indeed, several additional neurotransmitter
alterations have been identified in these two conditions; it would appear that the
Noradrenaline, Serotonine and Gammaaminobutyric acid systems are also
affected 7,22, but their participation in the clinical expression of the problem has not to
the present been clearly understood.

Interference with therapeutic response

Schizophrenics who abuse drugs tend to respond poorly to treatment; not
only do they show an increased inability to benefit from psychosocial rehabilitation
programs, but it would appear also that pharmacotherapy is less effective with them.
Both the initial and the long term responses to therapy are adversely affected. In a well
controlled study of young male schizophrenics, Bowers et al.9 elicited a significant
difference in symptom control during the first 10 days of drug therapy. Compared to
the controls, patients with a history of drug abuse (cannabis and/or cocaine) did more
poorly. The difference could not be explained on the bases of pharmacokinetic factors,
for both groups presented similar plasma concentrations of the neuroleptic used to
treat them. Instead, it was observed that drug abusing schizophrenics enter treatment
presenting lower blood concentrations of the Dopamine metabolite Homovanillic
acid, a finding that has been associated with poorer therapeutic response in other
studies as well23. A drug abuse background is also associated with slower recovery on
the long term. TURNER & TSUANG24 reported a study on the outcome of
schizophrenic, and noted that self-reported levels of drug use correlate positively with
length of stay in hospital and with duration of pharmacotherapy. The heaviest abusers,
these authors observed, were also the ones who required prescriptions for the longest
period of time.

ABSTRACT
The effect of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive
component of marijuana, on macrophage intrinsic and extrinsic anti-herpesvirus activities
was examined. THC had no effect on the capacity of the macrophage-like cells
RAW264.7, J774A.1, and P388D, to take up virus. In addition, replication of virus within
macrophages did not occur regardless of drug treatment indicating that THC had no
effect on macrophage intrinsic antiviral activity. In contrast, the cannabinoid exerted a
dose-dependent inhibition of macrophage extrinsic anti-viral activity. This activity describes
that macrophage function by which these cells suppress virus replication within
xenogeneic cells in an interferon-independent manner. The inhibitory effect of THC on
extrinsic antiviral activity was greatest on RAW264.7 and J774A.1 cells followed by P388D1
cells. These macrophage-like cells regained their extrinsic antiviral activity in a time-related
fashion following removal of the drug.
These results indicate that THC inhibits macrophage extrinsic anti-herpesvirus
activity but has no effect on intrinsic antiviral activity. However, the suppressive effect of
THC on extrinsic antiviral activity is reversible upon removal of the drug.

INTRODUCTION
Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of
marijuana, has been shown to elicit a variety of immunosuppressive effects in vivo and

138

in vitro. These include dysfunction in lymphocyte response to mitogens and particulate
antigens (1,2), decrease in T-cell rosette formation (3,4), inhibition of natural killer cell
activity (5,6), suppression of leukocyte migration (7), and perturbation of macrophage
morphology, function, and motility (8-10). THC, in addition, has been shown to decrease
host resistance to bacterial and virus infections. Morahan et al.(11) demonstrated that
mice treated with various cannabinoids experienced a dose-related decrease in resistance
to both Listeria monocytogenes and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2). We have
demonstrated that exposure of mice and guinea pigs to THC exacerbates primary HSV2
genital infection (12).
Macrophages play a critical role in host immunity, especially at the primary site of
infection. These cells are actively involved in resistance to intracellular infection (13), act
as accessory cells in the immune response in their capacity as antigen-presenting cells
and as producers of immunomodulatory signals (14,15), and function as cytotoxic
effectors against tumor cells (16) and virus-infected cells (17). Macrophages also exert
intrinsic and extrinsic antiviral activities. Intrinsic activity is the process by which
macrophages ingest virus, degrade virus, and thereby are nonpermissive for productive
virus infection (18-21). This degradation of virus by macrophages facilitates clearance of
virus from the local site of infection. Extrinsic antiviral activity is the process by which
macrophages elicit an interferon-independent, cell contact-dependent reduction of virus
growth in infected, virus-susceptible cells (22). Both intrinsic and extrinsic antiviral activities
play an important role in the control of localized virus infection and in limiting the spread
of virus within the infected host.
Drug-induced alteration of macrophage antiviral activities could have a major effect
on host resistance to venereally-transmitted pathogens, particularly at the primary site of
exposure. Thus, the objective of this study was to define the effect of THC on
macrophage intrinsic and extrinsic antiviral activities. Results of this investigation
demonstrate that THC has no effect on intrinsic anti-HSV2 activity but suppresses
macrophage extrinsic antiviral activity to HSV2.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Cultures
The macrophage-like cell lines Raw 264.7 (TIB71), J774A.1 (TIB67), and P388D,
(TIB63) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD).
Macrophages were grown in complete RPMI 1640 medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS); 1% L-glutamine; 1% nonessential amino acids; 1%
antibiotic/antimycotic (penicillin 10,000 U/ml; Amphotericin B 25 ug/ml, and Streptomycin
10,000 ug/ml); 1.5% Hepes; 1.5% sodium bicarbonate, and 1% MEM vitamins). Green
Monkey Kidney (Vero) cells were grown in RPM11640 supplemented as described above.
Cells were grown and maintained at 37C in a humidified 5% C02 atmosphere.
Virus
Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2; strain HSV-FMC-P180) was isolated from
cervical tissue of a gynecological patient with carcinoma in situ at the Medical College of
Virginia/VCU. The virus was plaque-purified and was typed as HSV2 by partial restriction

endonuclease digestion as described previously (23).
Virus stocks were prepared by infecting confluent monolayers of Vero cells at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and harvesting the virus when 90% of the cells mani­
fested typical HSV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). Virus titer was determined by plaque
assay (24) using Vero cells grown in 24 well tissue culture plates (Corning, Inc. Corning,
NY.). A virus stock with a titer of 1 X 108 plaque-forming units per ml (PFU/ml) was
employed in these studies.
Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol Preparation.
Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (FW=316) was obtained from the National Ins­
titute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Rockville, MD. THC was prepared from a stock solution of
100 mg/ml in 95% ethanol. The stock solution was appropriately diluted in complete RPMI
1640 medium such that 10 p \ was added per ml of medium to yield final concentrations
of 10'5M, lO^M, or 10‘7M THC and 0.1% ethanol. The vehicle consisted of I0 /¿I of 9.5%
ethanol per ml of RPMI 1640 medium to yield a final concentration in medium of 0.1%
ethanol. Placebo cultures consisted of RPM11640 medium inoculated with 10 i i \ / n \ \ of the
same medium.
In vitro Exposure of Macrophages to Delta-9-tetrahvdrocannabinol.
For assessment of the effect of THC on intrinsic antiviral activity, confluent
monolayers of macrophages in 24-well cluster plates (5 X 105 cells/well) were pretreated
with THC (10'5M, lO^M, or 10’7M), vehicle (0.1% ethanol), or placebo (medium only) for
48 hr. Following washing with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the macrophage­
like cells were exposed to HSV2 and were evaluated for intrinsic antiviral activity. For
assessment of the effect of THC on macrophage extrinsic antiviral activity, macrophages
in 75 cm2 culture flasks were exposed to THC (10'5M, 10'6M, or 10'7M), vehicle, or
placebo for 48 hr. Alternatively, macrophages were exposed to the drug or vehicle for 48
hr and then were maintained in THC-free medium for 48 or 120 hr. Cells, then, were
scraped into the medium with a rubber policeman, assessed for viability by trypan blue
exclusion, enumerated, and added to virus-infected Vero cell monolayers for assessment
of extrinsic antiviral activity.
Assay of Intrinsic Antiviral Activity.
Following exposure to THC, vehicle, or placebo, macrophage-like cells were
washed with sterile PBS and a 0.1 ml inoculum calculated to contain 50 PFU of HSV2 was
added to each confluent macrophage monolayer in 24 well tissue culture plates. Replicate
cultures containing Vero cell monolayers were inoculated with an equal volume of HSV2
in order to quantitate the number of input infectious virus on the basis of plaques elicited.
Macrophages were adsorbed with HSV2 for 1, 2, 3, 4, 24, and 48 hr. At the end of each
of the designated time periods, the supernatant from each culture was removed and the
corresponding cell monolayer was lysed by three rapid freeze-thaw cycles. The
corresponding supernatant and cell lysate of each macrophage culture were quantitated
for infectious virus by plaque assay.
Assay of Extrinsic Antiviral Activity.
Confluent Vero cell monolayers (5 X 105 cells) in 24-well cluster plates were

140

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

inoculated with a 0.1 ml volume of HSV2 such that each of the first 2 columns of wells
received 500 PFU. The remaining 4 columns of wells received 250, 125, 60, or 30 PFU,
respectively. Following incubation for 1.5 hr at 37C in a 5% C02 environment to allow for
virus adsorption, the Vero cell monolayers were washed three times with sterile PBS
(37 °C) to remove unabsorbed virus . Suspensions (1 ml) of placebo-, vehicle-, or THCtreated macrophages, then, were added to the Vero cell monolayers such that the 4 rows
of wells contained macrophage:Vero cell co-cultures at effector cell:target cell (E:T) ratios
of 5:1, 3:1, and 1:1. Duplicate plates contained wells with virus-infected (500 PFU to 30
PFU) Vero cells or with uninfected Vero cells in the absence of macrophages. Additionally,
uninfected Vero cells were co-cultured with macrophages at E:T ratios of 5:1 to 1:1 to
monitor for potential macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity against the Vero cells. Trypan
exclusion staining demonstrated that the macrophage lines did not effect cytolysis of
uninfected Vero cells. Following the addition of macrophages, the culture plates were
centrifuged (800 rpm, 15 min) to allow for effector celktarget cell contact and 1 ml of 2%
methylcellulose in complete RPM11640 medium was added to each well. After three days
of incubation at 37C in a 5% C02 environment, the plates were fixed with 4%
formaldehyde in PBS, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and enumerated for virus plaques.
Each series of experiments was performed six times. The number of plaques elicited in
HSV2-infected Vero cell monolayers in the absence of macrophages was designated as
100%. Extrinsic antiviral activity was measured by calculating the percentage plaques
elicited in macrophage:HSV2-inoculated Vero cell co-cultures when compared with
similarly HSV2-inoculated Vero cell monolayers maintained in the absence of
macrophages. The lower the percentage plaques noted in co-cultures, the greater the
extrinsic macrophage antiviral activity.
Statistics.
Virus titration data were expressed as log10. Means ± S.E.M. were obtained from
data from the individual cultures. Student’s two tailed t-test was employed to determine
statistical significance of the data (25).
RESULTS
Effect of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol on Intrinsic Antiviral Activity.
Virus uptake experiments were performed in order to directly evaluate the effect
of THC on intrinsic antiviral activity. Infectious virus in each macrophage culture
supernatant and corresponding cell lysate was quantitated by plaque assay. Virus plaques
produced from the cell lysates served as a measure of infectious virus taken up by
macrophages at the designated time periods. In addition, these plaques served as a
measure of virus "survival" within the recipient macrophages. In contrast, virus plaques
elicited by the culture supernatants (1 to 4 hr postinoculation (pi)) served as a measure
of input infectious virus not taken up by the macrophages. Plaques elicited by the 24 hr
or 48 hr pi culture supernatants served as a measure of productive virus infection within
macrophages since by that time log10-fold amounts of HSV2 are released into the culture
medium by virus-permissive cells. Results from a representative experiment of the effect
of THC on intrinsic antiviral activity of J774A.1 macrophages are listed in Table I.

1J774A.1 macrophages were treated with THC, vehicle, or placebo for 48 hr, washed, and
inoculated with approximately 50 PFU of HSV2. The number of input PFU was
corroborated by counting plaques elicited on Vero cell control monolayers following their
exposure to the same inoculum. At each of the indicated times post-virus inoculation (pi)
the supernatant and monolayer lysate from each culture were recovered and were
assessed for infectious virus by plaque assay.
2Placebo= medium only.
^he numbers outside the parentheses denote PFU elicited by the culture supernatant
while those within parentheses denote PFU produced by the cell lysate from the
corresponding culture.
Plaque assay of control Vero cell monolayers yielded 45-55 PFU following inoculation with
a 0.1 ml volume of virus suspension calculated to contain 50 PFU. At 1 hr pi, the sum of
infectious virus in the culture supernatants and corresponding cell monolayers, regardless
of treatment regimen, ranged from 40 - 45 PFU. Thus, each culture was inoculated with
a comparable amount of infectious virus. Lysates of vehicle-treated J774A.1 cells yielded
12 plaques following a one hour absorption period. By 48 hr post-virus inoculation (pi),
lysates of the J774A.1 cells yielded only 4 plaques. A parallel decrease in infectious virus
from culture supernatants accompanied the decrease in infectious intracellular virus. By
24 hr, culture supernatants plus cell lysates yielded a total of 23 PFU. These results
indicate that within the first 4 hr approximately 50% of the input virus was taken up and
degraded by the macrophages. By 48 hr pi approximately 30% of the total original input
infectious virus remained in the macrophage cultures. Thus, the input virus was readily
taken up and degraded by the macrophages. A similar temporal reduction in infectious
virus was observed for J774A.1 cells treated with THC (10‘5 to 10'7). Even after exposure
to 10‘5M THC, macrophage intrinsic anti-HSV2 activity remained unaffected. At one hour
pi, cell lysates yielded 18 PFU of HSV2. By 48 hr pi, cell lysates produced only 5 PFU. A
temporal decrease in extracellular virus from the culture supernatants also was recorded
(e.g. 27 PFU at 1 hr pi versus 12 PFU at 48 hr pi). Similar results were obtained when

142

P388D, macrophages were employed in the intrinsic antiviral studies (Data not shown).
Thus, these results indicate that THC in the doses employed did not affect virus uptake
by macrophages. Furthermore, the macrophages remained nonpermissive for HSV2
replication.
Effect of THC on Extrinsic Antiviral Activity.
The effect of THC on extrinsic antiviral activity of P388D,, RAW264.7, and J774A.1
macrophage-like cells was assessed. Macrophages were incubated with THC (10'5M, 10'
6M, or 10'7M), vehicle, or placebo for 48 hr and, then, were co-cultured with virusinoculated Vero cell monolayers at effector cell:target cell (E:T) ratios of 5:1, 3:1, and 1:1.
Phase contrast microscopy and Nomarski optics microscopy demonstrated that THC
treatment of macrophages had no effect on the attachment of macrophages to the virusinfected cells. Macrophage extrinsic antiviral activity was measured on the basis of
suppression of plaque formation in macrophage:HSV2-infected Vero cell co-cultures when
compared with plaque formation in similarly HSV2-infected Vero cell monolayers
maintained in the absence of macrophages.
Figure 1 illustrates results of a typical experiment for assessing the effect of THC
on macrophage extrinsic antiviral activity. Co-cultures of vehicle-treated P388D,
macrophages and HSV2-inoculated Vero cells at E:T ratios of 5:1 yielded a minimal
number of virus plaques (Figure 1A1. Even at an E:T ratio of 1:1, extrinsic antiviral activity
was exerted since less than 50% of the input virus elicited plaques. In contrast, decreased
extrinsic antiviral activity was evident for co-cultures containing macrophages exposed to
THC (Figure 1B). Co-cultures at the highest E:T ratio (e.g., 5:1) expressed a much greater
number of virus plaques than the comparable co-cultures containing vehicle-treated
macrophages. Co-cultures at E:T ratios of 5:1,3:1, and 1:1 expressed a greater than two­
fold increase in plaques when compared with co-cultures containing vehicle-treated
macrophages.
Figure 2 illustrates quantitatively the effect of THC on macrophage extrinsic antiviral
activity. Vero cell control monolayers, were inoculated with aliquots of virus suspension
calculated to contain 120, 60, or 30 PFU of HSV2. The respectively-infected monolayers,
maintained in the absence of macrophages were designated as producing the maximal
number of virus plaques (i.e., 100%). The percentage of virus plaques elicited in co­
cultures of macrophages and virus-inoculated Vero cells, then, was determined by
comparison to the 100% yield of the corresponding virus-inoculated Vero cell monolayer.
Infected Vero cells co-cultured with J774A.1 macrophages which were treated with
placebo or vehicle yielded a minimal number of plaques when compared with HSV2inoculated Vero cell control monolayers indicating that the J774A.1 cells exerted extrinsic
antiviral activity. Co-cultures containing vehicle-treated or placebo-treated macrophages,
and maintained at E:T ratios of 5:1 and 3:1, yielded less than 30% the number of plaques
recorded for HSV2-infected Vero cell controls. Even at the lowest E:T ratio (1:1),
macrophage extrinsic antiviral activity was exerted by placebo-treated and vehicle-treated
cells since co-cultures yielded less than 58% of the plaques noted in control HSV2infected Vero cell cultures. In contrast, co-cultures containing THC-treated J774A.1
macrophages and HSV2-infected Vero cells yielded a dose-related increase in viral
plaques indicative of a dose-related decrease in macrophage extrinsic anti-HSV2 activity.

Section I. Physiopathology

143

At E:T ratios of 1:1, THC eliminated nearly all of the macrophage extrinsic antiviral activity.
Indeed, co-cultures containing macrophages treated with 10'5M THC yielded greater than
90% the number of plaques recorded for monolayers of control HSV2-infected Vero cells.

Similar results were obtained when RAW264.7 macrophages were employed as
effector cells. At E:T ratios of 5:1 and 3:1, a minimal number of plaques was elicited in co­
cultures containing macrophages treated with vehicle or placebo (i.e., less than 40%). In
contrast, a drug dose-related increase in plaque formation was noted at all E:T ratios for
co-cultures containing macrophages treated with 10'5M through 10'7M THC. At E:T ratios
of 3:1 and 1:1, co-cultures containing macrophages treated with 10'5M or lO^M THC
expressed greater than 70% the number of plaques observed in control HSV2-infected
Vero cell cultures indicative of a loss of most extrinsic macrophage antiviral activity. This
decrease was also noted for macrophages which were treated with 10‘7M drug and then
were added to HSV2-infected Vero cells at an E:T ratio of 1:1.
THC, also, was shown to diminish the extrinsic antiviral activity of the P388D,
macrophage-like cells. Co-cultures of placebo-treated or vehicle-treated P388D,
macrophages and HSV2-infected Vero cells at E:T ratios of 5:1 and 3:1 produced less
than 20% the number of PFU produced by HSV2-infected Vero cell monolayers. Even at
an E:T ratio of 1:1, less than 50% the number of plaques recorded for virus-infected Vero
cell cultures was noted for co-cultures containing P388D, cells treated with placebo or
vehicle. THC exerted a dose-related increase in the percentage of virus plaques formed
in co-cultures with E:T ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 when compared with HSV2-infected Vero cell
monolayers maintained in the absence of macrophages indicative of a decrease in
macrophage extrinsic anti-HSV2 activity. Macrophages treated with 10'5M or lO^M THC,
and co-cultured with HSV2-infected Vero cells at E:T ratios of 3:1 or 1:1, expressed
greater than 70% the number of PFU expressed in HSV2-infected Vero cell cultures alone.
However, at an E:T ratio of 5:1 THC exerted no major effect on macrophage extrinsic
antiviral activity. For these latter co-cultures, less than 10% the number of plaques noted
for Vero cell monolayers was recorded.
Temporal Effect of THC Exposure on Macrophage Extrinsic Antiviral Activity.
To assess whether macrophages treated in vitro with THC could recover their
extrinsic antiviral activity following removal of the drug, an additional set of experiments
was performed in which macrophages were maintained in THC-free medium for 48 hr or
120 hr following the 48 hr drug exposure period. The macrophages, then, were added to
HSV2-infected Vero cell monolayers and were assessed for extrinsic antiviral activity. A
time-dependent recovery of extrinsic anti-HSV2 activity by the macrophage-like cells was
recorded. Results of the effect of drug removal on the recovery of extrinsic antiviral activity
of J774A.1 macrophages at an E:T ratio of 3:1 are shown in Figure 3. As expected, co­
cultures containing macrophages treated with vehicle elicited a minimal number of
plaques at all time periods. These observations indicate that the J774A.1 cells exerted
extrinsic antiviral activity throughout the experimental period. In agreement with previous
experiments, co-cultures containing macrophages treated with THC for 48 hr exhibited a
dose-related increase in the percentage of plaques formed indicative of a dose-related
decrease in extrinsic macrophage antiviral activity. Co-cultures containing J774A.1
macrophages, regardless of the dose of drug exposure, maintained in drug-free medium
for 48 hr yielded less than 40% the number of plaques which was recorded for HSV2infected Vero cell monolayers cultured in the absence of macrophages. Co-cultures
containing macrophages maintained in drug-free medium for 120 hr exhibited less than

146

15% the number of plaques recorded for virus-infected Vero cell monolayers. These
observations indicate a nearly total recovery of extrinsic antiviral activity by the THCpretreated macrophages at all E:T ratios.

DISCUSSION
Macrophages exert two important antiviral functions, intrinsic antiviral activity and
extrinsic antiviral activity, in addition to their ability to bring about effector cell:target cell
contact-dependent lysis of virus-infected cells (26-29). In intrinsic antiviral activity,
macrophages engulf and degrade virus and thereby remain nonpermissive for virus
replication (18-21,30). In extrinsic antiviral activity, macrophages inhibit virus replication
within infected target cells in a cell contact-dependent, interferon-independent manner
(22,31).
Macrophage cell lines were employed in this study since they are free of
contaminating other cell types and can be cultivated to relatively high numbers. These cell
lines differ in degree of macrophage maturity and functional properties. The J774A.1,
P388D1( and RAW264.7 cells represent relatively "mature" macrophage-like cells and
exhibit many of the macrophage-virus interactions attributable to primary macrophages.
For example, J774A.1 cells characteristically produce lysozyme and superoxide radicals
which are important components of the intrinsic antiviral process (32). P388D1 cells
express Fc receptors and support growth of influenza A NWS virus (33) and West Nile
virus (34) consequent to virus-antibody complex interaction with these receptors. Both
J774A.1 and P388D, cells have been shown to produce acid-stable interferon when
inoculated with Newcastle Disease virus (35).
In the present investigation, THC was shown to have no effect on macrophage
intrinsic antiviral activity.An overall reduction in infectious virus in both culture supernatants
and cell lysates was recorded for macrophages pretreated with doses of THC as high as
10'5M. In addition, there was no significant difference in virus uptake by macrophages
treated with THC as compared with macrophages treated with vehicle or placebo. These
results indicate that THC causes neither a quantitative nor a temporal effect on HSV2
uptake by macrophages. Furthermore, the J774A.1 cells did not support productive virus
infection regardless of the drug treatment regimen. Thus, THC exposure did not alter or
inhibit those cellular compartments which effect macrophage nonpermissiveness for virus
replication. Sarmiento et al. (30) have shown that macrophage intrinsic resistance to HSV1
infection is due to restriction of viral macromolecular synthesis. HSV replication was found
to be inhibited in macrophages at multiple points in the virus growth cycle before the
onset of virus DNA synthesis. The results of this study indicate that THC does not target
those macrophage factors which are involved in restriction of HSV macromolecular
synthesis. Similar results were obtained when P388D1 cells were employed in the HSV2
uptake experiments indicating that the failure of THC to alter intrinsic macrophage antiviral
activity was not limited to the J774A.1 cells.
In contrast, THC affected the capacity of macrophages to exert extrinsic antiviral
activity. The mechanism by which macrophages exert this activity remains unresolved
although some aspects have been defined. Morahan et al. (31) indicated that the extrinsic
antiviral mechanism does not involve direct virus inactivation by extrinsic factors. Neither
macrophage supernatants nor lysates alone inactivated virus infection suggesting an
effector celktarget cell contact-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, the extrinsic antiviral
activity was unlike interferon-mediated inhibition since it was exerted against virus-infected
xenogeneic cells (36). Furthermore, Vero cells, which were used as targets in these
experiments, have been shown not to produce interferon (37). Thus, the macrophage

148

extrinsic antiviral activity was not species-specific in that the macrophages serving as
effectors were of murine origin while the virus-infected target cells (i.e., Vero cells) were
of primate origin. Other secretory products of macrophages, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1)
(38-41) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (42-45), have been shown to possess anti-viral
properties. However, the action of these molecules is neither dependent on effector
cell:target cell conjugation nor on cell contact as demonstrated for extrinsic antiviral
activity (36). Thus, it seems unlikely that interferon (IFN), 11-1, or TNF accounts for the
majority, if any, of the extrinsic antiviral activities attributed to macrophages. Nevertheless,
other secretory products such as neutral proteases and prostaglandins could be
responsible for non-specific antiviral effects of macrophages on virus or virus-infected
cells.
THC did not prevent any of the macrophage cell types from attaching to the virusinfected xenogeneic Vero cells. These results are in agreement with our previous studies
which demonstrated that THC, injected intraperitoneally into mice which were
administered Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). did not prevent peritoneal
macrophages from attaching to virus-infected cells or to tumor cells (46). Similarly,
macrophages treated in vitro with 10'5M to 10'7M THC remained unaffected in their ability
to attach to target cells (46). Thus, these observations indicate that THC affects
macrophage extrinsic antiviral activity at a step other than effector cell:target cell
attachment. The mechanism by which THC effects this inhibition, however, remains
unresolved. THC has been shown to affect macromolecular synthesis in a variety of
cellular systems (46-50). We have shown that the cannabinoid inhibits differential
expression of macrophage proteins in response to external stimuli, such as bacterial
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and P. acnes (10). These observations suggest that THC may
alter extrinsic antiviral activity by suppressing macromolecular synthesis and/or
expression by macrophages. Alternatively, THC may bring about a morphological
disruption of cellular membranes (51,52) or of cytoskeletal elements (53). Perturbations
of cellular membranes could alter cellular compartments of protein synthesis and/or posttranslational events and thereby suppress the synthesis of these macrophage factors
which block virus replication at the level of expression of the early to delayed-early virus
genes. It has been proposed that an intact cytoskeletal system is requisite for natural killer
cell and for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte cell contact-dependent killing of target cells. Following
conjugation of the effector cell to the target cell, a rapid reorientation of the microtubular
organizing center and Golgi apparatus complex occurs within the target cell. This
orientation is effected toward the target cell and results in the direction of secretory
vesicles containing cytolytic components along the cytoskeletal tracts to the target cell
(54,55). Thus, THC, in addition to suppressing protein synthesis, could bring about a
disruption of cytoskeletal elements within the effector cell with the consequent failure in
transport of effector molecules to the virus infected cell. We have shown that THC
administered in vitro elicits membrane perturbation of cell surface and cytoplasmic
membranes in rat neuroblastoma cells (53).
The THC-induced inhibition of macrophage extrinsic antiviral activity was shown to
be reversible. J774A.1 and P388D! macrophages treated with THC for 48 hr, and then
incubated in drug-free medium for 48 or 120 hr, regained extrinsic antiviral activity in a
time-dependent fashion. These observations are indicative of an ongoing "repair" process
by which macrophages gradually regain their functional competence against virally-

Section I. Physiopathology

149

infected cells following removal of THC from the environment. The results showing the
reversible effects of THC on macrophage extrinsic antiviral activity may be attributed to
macrophage regeneration and "sloughing off" of putatively drug-damaged cell
membranes. A similar process has been shown to occur in rat neuroblastoma cells (53).
Ejection of membranous structures was most evident when cells were treated in vitro with
10'5M and lO^M THC. The rat B103 neuroblastoma cells were shown to express surface
blebs following exposure to drug. Scanning electron microscopy revealed extracellular
globular membranous bodies surrounding the drug-exposed cells. In addition,
transmission electron microscopy demonstrated cytoplasmic membranous inclusions
seemingly in the process of extrusion from the drug-treated cells. Similar extruded
globular structures and surface blebs were observed by Nomarski optics microscopy for
macrophages treated in vitro with THC, especially at higher drug doses (i.e., 10'5M). While
these effects elicited by 10’5M THC could represent the outcome of exposure to a
relatively high drug concentration, they nevertheless may depict the upper limit of a
continuum of THC-induced effects which bring about repair of drug-damaged
macrophage membranes. The elimination of damaged membranes following removal of
the drug from the extracellular environment may allow for cells to regenerate cellular
membranes with a consequent temporal-dependent reestablishment of extrinsic antiviral
activity.
The THC doses which were employed in this in vitro study are achievable in
humans. Agurell et al. (56) have shown that serum THC peaks at concentrations as high
as 500 ng/ml within 30 min of smoking marijuana. This peak period is followed by an
equilibrium phase during which concentrations of THC may range from 0.5 ng/ml to 0.25
ng/ml in one to two days. Wall et al. (57) measured baseline levels of THC of
approximately 1 ng/ml in regular marijuana users. The rapid early decline of THC in
plasma is a consequence of extensive metabolism of the drug (58) and of uptake by
tissues due to its highly lipophilic nature (59). For example, relatively high concentrations
of THC could be anticipated in lung alveolar macrophages as a consequence of direct
exposure to marijuana smoke.

(Table 4).
T h e second explanation is that case m others w ere sim ply m ore open
and honest than the control women. This is a form o f recall bias, and for
som eth in g as sen sitive as ille g a l dru g use, could be sig n ifica n t factor.
A fte r all, the case m others are much m otivated to help than are control
m others. F u rth erm o re, the fig u re o f 1 c o n tro l m o th er in 204 u sing
m arih u an a is m uch lo w e r than w e w ou ld expect, based on o th e r U.S.
su rveys o f m arihuana use. One w ay to test this is to com p are the case
m others to the mothers o f children with other cancers - that is, a different
control group, recall bias should not be a factor here, since both the cases
and "con trols" are eq u a lly m otivated. F ortu n a tely, w e had data from
severa l oth er CCSG studies o f childhood cancers, in w hich ex a ctly the
same question had been asked.
It can been seen from the data in Table 5 that the mothers o f the A N L L
cases used m arihuana sig n ifica n tly m ore fre q u en tly than m others o f
ch ild ren w ith oth er cancers. Th e m arihuana-exposed cases sh ow ed a
high frequency o f cytogenetic abnormalities, specifically those in volvin g
chromosomes 8 and 11.
W e conclude that, although the association o f m arihuana exposure in
u te ro and su bsequ ent d e v e lo p m e n t o f A N L L has n ot b een fir m ly
established, the evidence is strong enough to ju stify further study. In our
current case-control study o f A N L L , w e w ill include many m ore children
(approxim ately 630), and w ill include a much more detailed section in the
questionnaire on all aspects o f illic it drug use. We are w o rk in g closely
w ith behavioral psychologists who have experience in surveys o f drug use,
and expect that the revised interview w ill substantially reduce the extent o f
under-reporting.
I f marihuana does have anything like the effect on A N L L risk that our
study suggests, it can be calculated that a substantial fraction o f the cases
o f A N L L in the U.S. could be attributed to this exposure.

Twenty cases o f advanced head and neck cancer in young patients, who were
regular marijuana users, are presented.
Numerous carcinogens, as well as
respiratory irritants, are found in marijuana smoke. The active euphoria-producing
agent, £ i-9 tetrahydrocanabinol produces altered T-cell function in some in vitro
systems and has been implicated in altered DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and
consequent chromosomal aberrations.
Key perturbations may be in altered
arginine metabolism resulted in disturbed nuclear histone synthesis and perhaps the
unmasking o f oncogene suppression.
KEYWORDS
Marihuana; Cancer : Head, neck, tongue; Young adults; DNA.
Malignancies o f the upper aerodigestive tract are uncommon tumors, with about
55,0 0 0 to 60,000 new cases reported per year in the U .S. (Silverberg, 1984).
This anatomical region includes the pharynx, larynx, oral cavity and sinonasal
tract.
Squamous cell cancer makes up the majority of these cases, and is
characterized by slow growth and a trend toward regional metastases to adjacent
lymph nodes. This is in contrast to many other tumor types throughout the body
such as malignancies o f the blood and lymph systems, carcinoma o f the lung, and
melanoma that tend to be more systemic in their behavior. The predominantly
regional nature o f squamous cell carcinoma makes it more amenable to control by
local resection and or radiation therapy. Unfortunately these tumors often present
with subtle symptoms, often suggestive of benign disease processes. If the patient

166

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

is given a somewhat cursory examination, they are tragically too frequently treated
as such. The symptoms invariably persist and the tumor is often quite large when
finally diagnosed, necessitating wide-field resection possibly combined with
postoperative radiation therapy. The result o f resecting these lesions, especially
the large ones, may leave the patient with devastating cosmetic and functional
impairments.
The average age at which patients with squamous cell carcinoma o f the upper
aerodigestive tract present is 64. Tumors o f this type are exceedingly unusual in
anyone under the age o f 40. The principal etiologic factors in the genesis o f these
tumors is the use o f tobacco and the excessive consumption o f alcohol. Smokeless
tobacco seems to have a carcinogenic effect equivalent to that when smoked.
Whether these factors act as a primary progenitor or trigger other factors that then
act in concert to produce this disease is unclear at this time. The suppression o f
local immune mechanisms has been demonstrated and some form o f genetic
predisposition may be significant.
In 1986, the author first reported what was felt to be an association between
smoking marijuana and the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
neck region (Donald, 1986). It became suddenly apparent after a 32-year old
patient asked if he thought his smoking of marijuana was the cause o f his tumor.
I then reviewed my total experience with these lesions in patients under the age o f
40 and identified seven patients. O f these, only one had not used marijuana in the
past or at the time o f presentation. Parenthetically, she had irradiation to the face
during adolescence for the therapy of acne and one could possibly invoke this as
the most likely etiological factor.
Stimulated by this apparent association, I conducted a review o f the literature
searching for evidence of factors that could implicate marijuana as a possible cause
of the disease. Abundant evidence became available from numerous research
efforts indicating marijuana as a possible carcinogen and thereby as a cause of
upper aerodigestive tract malignancy in the young.
Marijuana has an abundance o f primary irritants and carcinogens. C*-9 Tetra­
hydrocannabinol (THC) has been found to cause chemical aberrations in DNA and
RNA, resulting in perturbations in chromosomes. It has also been found to cause
alterations in T-cell function.

Methods and Materials
In a review o f the author’s 20-year experience of over 3000 head and neck cancer
cases, only 22 were identified who had squamous cell carcinoma and were under
the age o f 40. Those with adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and sarcoma were not
included in the study. The tobacco smoking, alcohol intake, and marijuana
smoking activities were researched. Their course o f treatment and treatment
outcomes were recorded.

Results
Table I describes the patient population who were marijuana smokers. Their
average age was 26 .2 years. Table II describes their treatment and eventual
outcome. O f the 13 patients under age 40, only two were not marijuana smokers.
The first patient was 38 years of age when first diagnosed with her extensive
maxillary sinus tumor. She was not a marijuana smoker and did not use tobacco
or alcohol. As previously described, she was treated as an adolescent with
irradiation to the face for acne. The other non-marijuana user was 32 years o f age
at presentation with his relatively small (2 cm in diameter) carcinoma o f the lateral
tongue. Six months following wedge resection of the tongue, he developed a
metastasis to the neck for which he underwent radical neck dissection. Pulmonary
metastasis occurred four months later; and he succumbed to his disease within the
following six months. He and patient #1 were the only deaths in the series. One
patient is alive with disease four years postoperatively and is being maintained on
chemotherapy. All others are alive and well without disease, for a 81.8% tumor
free survival rate with only three patients followed for less than two years. One
patient who was free o f his original tumor for 15 years has now a second primary
carcinoma o f his temporal bone.
O f the marijuana smokers (Table I), only 50% (four patients) were also tobacco
smokers and three patients were heavy imbibers of alcohol. In this group, only
one patient died, one patient is alive and well with disease, while the others remain
free o f cancer (Table II). The vast majority o f head and neck cancers recur locally
between one and two years postoperatively. We have one patient who is disease
free at one year, and another at two years. One patient has a small local
recurrence, but refuses further surgery because o f probable loss o f her remaining
eye. She has been maintained on chemotherapy for two years. The remainder are
alive and well between three and ten years postoperatively.

Because o f the extensive nature of the tumors in these patients, only one individual
was treated by surgery alone. One other had radiation therapy because he was
considered inoperable and incurable; and he died two months following
presentation. The remainder were treated by a combination o f radical surgery
followed by a full course of radiation therapy. An illustration o f the radical nature
of this type o f surgery is exemplified by the patient in Figure 1. This is basically
the type o f surgery employed in patients 2, 4, 5, and 6. To follow are some case
reports demonstrating the mode of presentation and outcome o f some o f these
patients.
Case Reports
Case 1. A 19-year old Vietnam war veteran was seen in January 1971 with a sixweek history of a rapidly enlarging, painless mass in the neck. An incisional
biopsy (by another surgical service) led to a diagnosis o f squamous cell carcinoma.
On referral to the EN T service at the Veterans Hospital and the University o f Iowa
Department o f Otorhinolaryngology and Maxillofacial Surgery, examination
revealed a rock-hard, slightly tender, 10 x 6 cm mass in the right side o f the neck,
which was fixed to the underlying structures, including the paraspinous muscles.
Indirect examination revealed a large, fungating mass in the pyriform fossa. A
biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma. Further inquiry revealed that the patient
had smoked cigarettes since his early teens and began smoking marijuana while in
the service. He as a heavy consumer o f the drug, and recently had taken to
smoking "joints" dipped in embalming fluid. Despite vigorous treatment with
radiation therapy, he died within two months.
Case 3 . A 27-year old white man was first seen with an enlarging lesion in the
lower lip in January 1984. In June 1984, a wedge resection incompletely removed
a squamous cell carcinoma that was a little more than 2 cm in diameter. In
September 1984, the patient was seen again with a 2 X 2 .5 cm hard nodule,
extending from the vermilion border o f the lower lip into the skin o f the chin. The
tumor was not fixed to the mandible (Fig. 1). Bilateral cervical adenopathy was
palpable. The patient had smoked one package o f cigarettes per day for 12 years,
and had smoked two "joints" of marijuana per day for "many years." In Septem­
ber 1984, an extended resection o f the lip and a bilateral conservation neck
dissection were done. The margins surrounding the tumor in the lip and chin were
clear, and the enlarged lymph nodes in both sides o f the neck were uninvolved
with cancer. The patient is alive and well without disease, five years after
surgery. (Fig. 2).

Case 4 . In May 1984, a 34-year old man was seen with a neck mass of seven to
eight months duration in the right jugulodigastric region. He had no other
symptoms and no weight loss, and felt perfectly well. Although the head and neck
examination was negative (aside from the 3 cm neck mass), panendoscopy revealed
a 4 .5 cm endophytic tumor of the right tonsillar fossa. Biopsy led to a diagnosis
o f squamous cell carcinoma. The patient had never drunk alcoholic beverages or
smoked tobacco, but he had regularly smoked three to seven "joints" of marijuana
per week for many years. In early June 1984, he underwent a composite
resection, with a lingual split o f the mandible and right radical neck dissection.
A postoperative fistula developed, and postoperative radiation therapy had to be
discontinued at 2700 rads because of the onset of osteoradionecrosis of the
mandible. This eventually cleared, and the patient is at present free of tumor.
Case 6 . This 38-year old man first came to an outside facility in October 1983
with a rapidly growing mass in the left jugulodigastric area of the neck. The mass
was excised in January 1984, and a "cyst with a cancer in it" was found. A
panendoscopic examination (done two days later) revealed no evidence of primary
neoplasm. The tonsils were not removed at this time and did not appear to be
abnormal. The patient underwent radiation therapy for two weeks, but a CAT
scan revealed further adenopathy and a radical neck dissection was immediately
performed. The patient refused postoperative radiation therapy. The patient was
referred to the Department o f Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery at the
University o f California, Davis in November of 1984 with a left neck mass o f six
weeks duration. He had a history of dysphagia and odynophagia for 11 weeks, as
well as hoarseness and stridor. He had experienced left otalgia since the radical
neck dissection of February 1984. There had been a 14 lb weight loss. Physical
examination revealed a massive ulcerating neoplasm in the left lateral pharyngeal
wall, extending from below the torus tubarius almost to the vallecula. Two masses
were discovered in the left neck. One, measuring 5 cm in diameter, fixed to the
skin with possible carotid fixation deeply, and a smaller, 1.5 cm in diameter,
mobile mass just below it (Fig. 3). The patient had never smoked tobacco and was
only an occasional social drinker. However, he had smoked one to two pipes of
marijuana daily for many years. Panendoscopic examination revealed tumor
extension from the superior pole of the tonsil to the ipsilateral ary epiglottic fold.
Biopsies led to a diagnosis o f squamous cell carcinoma. An exploratory operation
was performed in November 1984. The tumor was found to be fixed to a long
stretch o f the internal and common carotid arteries. A wide debulking o f the neck
tumor was done, the pharyngeal neoplasm was untouched, and the skin involve­
ment was resected. The neck wound was closed with a pectoralis major flap. The

patient was sent home after an uncomplicated postoperative period. He was given
a combination of cis-platinum and 5-fluorouracil, and a full course o f irradiation
therapy. The response has been complete, and there is no evidence o f gross tumor
at the present time.
Case 8 . This 35-year old medical student was first seen with a mass in the right
neck and a complaint of sore throat in November o f 1988. On examination he
had a slight "hot potato" voice. He had a 2.5 cm. mass in the right jugulodigastric
area and a moderately large ulcerating tumor in the right tongue base measuring
approximately 3.5 cm in diameter. The larynx was not invaded by tumor. He
was a nonsmoker and nondrinker, but had been a "weekend user" o f marijuana
while in college. A panendoscopic examination revealed no evidence o f other
neoplasms.
Biopsies of the lesion revealed a diagnosis o f squamous cell
carcinoma. He was treated with tongue base resection, removal o f the preepiglottic space and radical neck dissection. Postoperative radiation therapy was
given at a dosage o f 6500 rads to the primary and 4000 to both necks. The patient
made an excellent recovery, has excellent speech and swallowing, and is back in
medical school. He is disease free at 18 months since his surgery.
Case 9 . This 33-year old checker at a food store first presented with nasal
obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain in 1986. Physical examination revealed a
mass in her left nasal fossa. Radiographs revealed a mass lesion in her right nasal
fossa, upper maxillary sinus, ethmoid bloc, and orbit. The tumor’s geographic
center appeared to be in the ethmoids with extension to the sphenoid sinus and the
floor o f the anterior cranial fossa. She had a long history o f drug abuse, being a
frequent user o f marijuana over many years, as well as cocaine and methamphetamines. Biopsy of the mass showed poorly differentiated mucoepidermoid
carcinoma. An anterior craniofacial resection
was done. This was
followed four weeks later by 6500 rads to the tumor bed. About one year
postoperatively, she developed a small mass near the medial aspect o f the right
eyebrow. A CAT scan revealed a mass in the region of the frontal sinus with
extension intracranially into the right orbit and under the forehead skin. Further
resection would require exenteration o f the remaining eye and repeat craniotomy.
She has been maintained on chemotherapy and to this date has declined further
surgery.

Discussion
These data are presented because o f the surprising coincidence o f marijuana
smoking and head and neck cancer in this group o f young patients. With the
exception o f nasopharyngeal carcinoma in young Chinese, in my experience with
more than 3000 head and neck cancers, there have been no other carcinomas seen
in persons o f this age group other than this cohort o f patients. The average age
in this group when the tumor first appeared was 2 6 .2 years, with a minimum o f
19 and a maximum o f 38 years. This is in contrast, for example, to the average
age o f onset o f pyriform fossa carcinoma, in our experience, (Donald, 1980)) o f
6 4 .6 years, which is generally representative o f squamous cell carcinoma patients.
The frequent association of head and neck cancer with tobacco and heavy alcohol
consumption is well known. In these patients, some had never smoked tobacco
and were either occasional drinkers or nondrinkers. Some studies suggest that
smoking marijuana and tobacco may have a synergistic effect, one that is greater
than the effects o f each individually (American Thoracic Society, 1975). Recent
experimental work has shown that greater amounts o f primary irritants to the
tracheobronchial tree are found in marijuana smoke than in tobacco smoke
(American Thoracic Society, 1975; Fehr, 1972; Fehr, 1983). These include
ammonia, hydrocyanic acid, acrolein, and benzene. Fehr and Kalant (1983) found
that the smoke condensate - or tar - from marijuana smoke had a 70% higher
concentration of naphthalene than tobacco smoke. It also contained an especially
abundant amount of benzopyrene, a definitive carcinogen. Other carcinogenic
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzanthracene, are 50% higher in
marijuana (American Thoracic Society News, 1975). Nitrosamines are found in
equal concentrations in both kinds of smoke. A further distressing fact is that
these carcinogens may be concentrated by the paraphernalia used to enhance the
euphoric effect o f marijuana by increasing the actual amount o f drug in the smoke.
Herbicides such as Paraquat may exist as contaminants and may be carcinogenic.
Numerous experiments have been carried out on tissue cultures (and in vivo) in an
attempt to ascertain the effect o f marijuana smoke and its active euphoriaproducing hydrocarbon c2i -9-tetra-hydrocannabinol (A -9-T H C ) on cellular DNA,
RNA, and protein. Experiments by Leuchtenberger et al (1973 a & b) have shown
that the tobacco and marijuana smoke markedly alters cellular morphology,
mitosis, and DNA synthesis in fresh lung explant. They have also demonstrated
atypical proliferations o f cells, as well as alterations in DNA content and
chromosomal complement. Other studies, quoted in the review by Fehr and Kalant

178

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

(1972), showed reduced DNA and RNA synthesis in cell cultures exposed to
cannabis smoke. This results in the production of chromosome breaks, the
synthesis o f hypoploid cells (cells containing a reduced number o f chromosomes),
and cells with micronuclei (Leuchtenberger, 1973).
A fascinating theory concerning the mechanism of action of c2i-9-THC is its effect
in depletion o f cellular arginine. This results in a deficiency in nuclear histone
synthesis. Nuclear histones are the central core material around which the double­
helical strands o f DNA are wound. Changes in nuclear histones produce charac­
teristic ultrastructural alterations. Many of the enzymes responsible for DNA and
RNA metabolism have arginine at their specific site o f action. With the arginine
depleted because o f the influence of A -9-TH C , these enzymes are partially or
completely inactivated (Fehr, 1983). This is especially manifested in spermatids
and leukocytes.
Chromosomal abnormalities, growth retardation, disturbed
gametogenesis and function, as well as Cushmanimmunosuppression, can all be
explained on the basis of arginine deficiency.
The search for the possible
depletion or masking of an oncogene suppressor that may thus result in oncogene
expression is in progress.
There is abundant definitive evidence in animals that marijuana smoke and £>-9THC decrease both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. However, the evidence
in human beings is somewhat conflicting. Petersen et al (1975) found lowered Tcell counts in chronic marijuana smokers compared to non-smokers, as well as less
effective phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation of lymphocytes. Additionally,
their polymorphonuclear leukocytes were less able to phagocytose yeast cells,
compared to nonsmoking controls. However, no alterations in immunoglobulins
were noted. In a study by Morishima and Nahas (1975), marijuana smokers
demonstrated impairment of orderly T-cell replication, and this was duplicated in
vitro by the addition o f £>-9-THC to lymphocyte cell cultures o f nonsmokers. A
more recent report by Nahas (1989) describe both cellular and humoral immune
suppression in mice who were exposed to marijuana smoke or received A -9-TH C
parenterally. Perturbations o f monocyte and macrophage function were found as
well. Zimmerman (1989) et al found a dose dependent depression of both the
inductive and productive phases o f humoral immunity in mice exposed to
enantiomeric cannabinoid.
Cushman et al (1975, 1976) showed a marked
reduction in T-cell function when compared to either tobacco smokers or
nonsmokers. Although the exact clinical significance o f rosette formation is
unclear, there is an association o f suppression o f this phenomenon and the altered
immunity often found in cancer (Hong, 1975). Specter (1989) found a dose

Section / . Physiopathology

179

related suppression of natural killer cells of human peripheral blood mononuclear
cells when exposed to A -9-TH C in concentrations o f 7.5 gm/ml or greater. Waltz
et al (1977) found that £i-9-TH C and cannabidiol, when introduced to the blood
o f healthy non-drug taking volunteers, caused suppression o f interleukin-1,
interleukin-2 and cytokine secretion. Analysis of a group of our patients who had
stopped smoking marijuana but had contracted head and neck cancer showed no
T-cell abnormalities.
On the other hand, Rachelefsky et al (1977) found no effect on the DNA synthesis
o f resting lymphocytes or on PH A stimulation when A -9-TH C was added. This
was supported by the study o f White et al (1975) who found no difference between
the in vitro responses to PH A or pokeweed mitogen on lymphocytes from 12
healthy marijuana smokers compared to 12 age-matched controls. However, in
this study the smokers used the weed for only 30 days.
The disturbing fact is that, although the effect of THC on the immune system is
controversial at the present time, this may simply be a reflection o f its
concentration. The concentrations of this euphoria-producing chemical are much
higher in the products o f hybrids of cannabis plants that have been more recently
produced. It has been estimated that some present day marijuana has a 600%
higher concentration o f THC than the product seen in the 1960’s. Concentrations
o f THC seen in some o f the sinsemilla hybrids reaches as high as 7 %, equally high
to double that level that is seen in hashish.
Only scant evidence exists suggesting the direct carcinogenic effect o f marijuana
smoke or tar. Marijuana smoke has been found to produce squamous metaplasia
of ciliated respiratory epithelium in dog trachea when the animals were exposed
to four marijuana cigarettes daily for 30 months (White, 1975). This was a far
greater effect than when the dogs were exposed to tobacco smoke. Rosenkrantz
and Fleischman (1979) demonstrated precancerous changes in the bronchial
epithelium o f rodents that were exposed to marijuana for months on a smoking
machine. Magus and Harris (1971) demonstrated premalignant alterations in the
cells of the sebaceous glands of rodent skin when painted with marijuana "tar."
Hoffman et al (1975) actually produced tumors with a similar experiment.
Montour et al (1981) showed a statistically increased incidence in the production
o f irradiation-induced tumors in rats that were injected with marijuana extract. In
human subjects, Henderson et al (1972) showed atypical cells (in bronchial biopsy
specimens) in chronic hashish smokers.

Information directly implicating marijuana in the genesis of human malignancies
was virtually nonexistent prior to 1986. Since that time a few reports have
emerged suggesting the association. Colon (1980) discovered 129 oral papillomata
in 105 young male inmates in three federal prisons over a ten year period. Their
ages varied between 20 to 36 years, with 71 patients being in their twenties. A1
patients admitted to heavy use of marijuana o f at least once per day for two years
or more. No histologic evidence of malignancy was found. Endicott (1989)
describes a series of 50 youthful patients with cancers of the head and neck
collected from the South Florida area. All of these individuals were users of
marijuana.
Ferguson (1989) and Taylor (1988) have reported on the possible relationship of
marijuana to cancer. Ferguson (1989) described a young man of 27 who died of
widespread metastatic carcinoma of the lung who was a heavy marijuana and
hashish smoker. Taylor (1988) reported on ten cases of carcinoma in youthful
marijuana smokers, two of whom had primary carcinoma of the lung and the
remaining eight with tumors in the upper aerodigestive tract. All the patients were
less than 40 years old. Three of the ten patients went on to die o f their disease.
A further study by Neglia (1990) showed that pregnant women who smoked
marijuana had a 10.6 times greater chance of giving birth to a child that would
eventually develop acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
A remarkable feature o f the group o f patients in our series is the rather high
survival rate they enjoy. O f the marijuana patients who had resectable cancers,
only two have had a local recurrence and the remainder are alive and well without
disease. Only two patients had small T1 (2 cm or less in diameter) lesions. Most
o f the remainder had T3 & T 4 lesions, many of them with lymph nodal metastasis.
The survival rate for these large tumors is usually around 25-35% . It is interesting
to speculate what may be the reason for this high success rate other than the factor
of age. However, an important caveat at this point is that five-year tumor free
survival is the bench test by which we gauge results, and some o f the patients
presented here have not gone five years. On the other hand, local recurrence of
tumor usually appears at one to two years in 80-90% o f cases.
Disquieting information concerning the effects of marijuana smoke on cellular
genetics and the immune system raises the level of suspicion, suggesting the
implication o f this drug in the genesis of cancer. Certainly the incidence of
marijuana smoking in this series of 20 patients with head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma intensifies the suspicion.

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

INTRODUCTION
Cannabis is a plant that belongs to the genus cannabaceas, a family that
comprises only two genera Cannabis and Humulus, the genus of hops. Many workers
are of the opinion that three species of cannabis can be delimited: cannabis sativa,
cannabis indica and cannabis ruderalis. Cannabis is the source of hempen fibers, an
edible akens, an oil of industrial value, some popular medicines and various
psychotropic preparations. The genus is thought to be native of Central Asia,
especially the Turksmenkaya and Uzbezkaya ex-Soviet Republica near the border with
Afghanistan. Undoubtly it is one of the oldest psychomimetics used by man and today
the hallucinogen most widely disseminated around the world. It was known by the
Chinese several thousand years BC and used in religious ceremonies by Assyrians,
Iranian Zend Avesta and Greek civilizations1.
The psychotropic use of cannabis have been also known for thousands of
years by the inhabitants of India, the Near East, the southoriental countries of Europe
and Africa. Many years later since Muslim faith -prohibited alcohol there was
immediate and considerable interest in a substitute that could produce pleasant
experiences without incurring in mortal sin84. The Arab invasions of the Minth to the
twelfth centuries into North Africa, from Egypt to the north of Tunisia, Algeria and
Morocco, introduced cannabis to these territories. The Spaniards did not use it, they
were Christians and wine was not forbidden to them.
Soon after the discovery of America the Spanish Crown directly fomented
the diffusion of cannabis, as the raw material for hemp rope, cord and sandals2. In
1554 officials of the Seville Company advised to the Council of Indies that flax and
hemp seeds should be sent to the New World. Nine years later (1563), Phillip II openly
ordered hemp sown in various parts of the American Empire3. However most attempts
to establish a hemp fiber industry failed. They were tried in Peru, Chile and Mexico,
but few enterprises succeeded Even in Peru hemp production was very limited and
rope had to be imported from Spain4. Only Chile maintained and developed the
capacity to export fiber5.
One of the earliest psychotropic uses of cannabis in Latin America seems
to have occurred in Brazil. West African slaves introduced cannabis smoking to that
country18. The ritual use by some Brazilian indigenous groups indicate an early
diffusion to the aboriginal civilizations6’11,14. In Mexico, cannabis was cultivated
immediatly after the first trip of Cortez. It seems that the aztecs soon learnt about its
hallucinogenic properties because by 1550 an ordinance passed prohibiting the
cultivation of that plant. However crops continued to be harvested and cannabis
adquired religious importance, sometimes substituting the sacred payote, which for
centuries had been used by chichimecas and Toltecs7.
Jamaica, discovered by Columbus in 1492, also received slaves brought by
Spaniards from West Africa, to replace the dying Arawak Indians. After 153 years of
Spanish domination it was invaded by British forces and many more black slaves were
imported to work in the agricultural fields. Probably these negro tribes brought
cannabis smoking as part of their religious or recreational activities. When indentured
labourers from India introduced to the island stronger forms of cannabis (ganga), its
use was diffused to extensive areas of the population, as occurred in Egypt and
Morocco. Cannabis was introduced to the Atlantic ports of Colombia by African
slaves or labourers who came from Jamaica or the Bahamas8. Soon it apread to the
Northern provinces of the country so when Jacques Joseph Moreau in 1840 used
hashish to observe its mental effects, they were very well known in the major and lesser
Antilles, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. Even in Peru, a physician described in 1856
the phantasies produced by hashish9.
By the end of the Nineteenth Century the femals cannabis plant was
smoked by coolies working in the Atlantic Area of Costa Rica. At that time the word

coolie was used to describe mixed individuals of Chinese, Indian or Negro descent.
Fighting and disorder had been observed among these labourers and it was attributed
to the smoking hemp. It must be also remembered that Jamaicans were also imported
to Costa Rica as labourers to complete the Limon-San Jose Railroad. Many of them
were also definite ganga smokers8.
few decades later travel and migration facilitated the spread of cannabis
use from Mexico, Jamaica, Colombia and Brazil to the Southern and Western
territories of the United States of America.

Before marihuana use adquired epidemic proportions in the
United States, there was considerable concern in South America about its toxic effects
and the serious social problems observed in the abusers. In Mexico, it was written that
many crimes were committed by persons addicted to marihuana. Use was very
extensive in jails but also in persons of high social classes18.
In Chile, the plant is known as "pito depango" and in a few years it spread
to the youth population. In a survey it was found that since the spring of 1968 there was
massive marihuana consumption by Chilean adolescents19. In Brazil in 1900 it was
discovered that "the Brazilian negro smoked, chewed and ate a drug prepared as pills
or the material was cooked". This drug was cannabis which in Brazilian language is
named maconha. A paper published in 1958 by several authors17 came to the
conclusion that cannabis abuse represented a serious social problem due to the great
number of affected persons, the huge quantities of drug used and the criminal activities
associated with its consumption, trafficking and commerce. In 1957 only is one city
(Sao Paulo) of 326 subjects investigated for maconha abuse 322 resulted positive.
During the same year 1381 men, 95 women and 150 minors were imprisonned for
offering, transporting or selling cannabis.
Jose LUCENA16 studied the great diversity of hallucinations experienced
during acute marihuana intoxication which he attributed to the several compounds
utilized by the consumers. He also observed individuals who were chronically
intoxicated by maconha and subjects who developed psychotic disorders characterized
by
schizophreniform,
confusional,
depressive,
paranoid
and
delirious
symptomatology. In the psychotic individuals he thought that there were complex
interrelationships between external precipitating factors and endogenous etiological
conditioners which made difficult the differentiation between schizophrenia and
schizophreniform reactions in some of these subjects.
Pacheco E. Silva18 documented schizophrenic disorders in subjects
intoxicated by marihuana. Some of those had certain schizoid manifestations which
developed into the full schizophrenic psychosis by use of the drug. He did not find
cases with dementing evolution as had been described in Oriental literature.
In Colombia the social problems of marihuana smokers were described in
the second largest city of that country55. As that time the illegal traffic and smoking of
marihuana was Colombia’s worst social problem affecting thousands of persons. He as
a pharmacologist described the effects of oral and intraperitoneal administration of
cannabis to dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs and ice. After a short period of stimulation he
registered a state of depression which lasted several hours. Catalapsy was observed
when the extract was administered intraperitoneally.
In 1962 an investigation was done of 50 former hashish addicts in Bahia
(Brazil)22. All wee men, treated in a sanatorium and 177 were prisioners (106 men and
11 women) sentenced for various crimes. In that city abuse of hashish usually began in

210

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

late childhood and during adolescence. The smoking of hashish was practiced mainly
by people with an abnormal personality, strongly conditioned by constitutional
factors. Familiar, social and economic factors were also important. Doubts about the
existence of a mental syndrome during acute hashish poisoning were probably the
result of insufficient research. These symptom were conditioned by the plant itself, by
the method of smoking or by the constitution of the addict. Hashish intoxication lead
to changes in a person’s instincts, feelings, activity, conscience and sensory
perception. The mental symptoms were mostly an expression of excitation of the
cerebral cortex or of the release of the subcortical formations and, rarely in a
secondary phase, of depression of the cortex. So far there were no evidence of any
permanent mental changes due to hashish, at least not in the material examined. In
prisoners investigated abuse of hashish was more frequently associated with theft and
murder. Though the causal role of the plant in these crimes had not been proved the
authors thought that it was possible that the disinhibition of desires facilitated crimes.
It must be admitted that hashish intoxication can predispose to other crimes on
account of the mental symptoms and this is the case with many other drugs and
intoxications22.
By the year 1969 physicians became aware of the cannabis epidemic in
Peru23. In Chile another practitioner19 two years later conducted an investigation of
drug use in young people. He came to the conclusion that since the spring of 1968 there
was massive consumption of marihuana bychilean youths (once 39.3 %, daily 1.5 %).
During the same year three Peruvian psychiatrists25 described clinical features of
36 children, adolescents and youngsters who used illicit drugs, mostly for a period of
2-4 years. They were mainly referred due to behaviour disturbances, compulsive drug
use, acute psychotic intoxications, anxiety attacks and suicide attempts. The main
drug of abuse was marihuana which was used alone or combined with other drugs
(LSD, alcohol). All of them had personality or behaviour disturbances before using
drugs. The six patients who developed psychoses showed profound thought
disorganization, paranoid ideation in clear consciousness which resembled
schizophrenia. Four recovered promptly (2-3 weeks) but 2 remained psychotic after
one year of follow up. The authors concluded that the effects of cannabis are dose
relatied, depend on the material used, previous personality and previous brain
pathology. In this group of patients it was documented that marihuana alone or mixed
with other drugs could precipitate acute, subacute and chronic psychotic disorders.
When the World Health Organization convened a meeting in Geneva of
health autorithies of 33 countries20 about alcohol and drug dependence, Chile
reported massive cannabis consumption by adolescents, apart from Chile, Mexico
answered that cannabis at that time was the main drug for high school studens of
middle an upper classes (regular users were 3.8 %). Venezuela responded that the most
commonly used drug was marihuana, especially among teenagers and délinquants.
A few years later drug use by dependents and members of the Peruvian
Armed Forces were reported26 indicating that use of illicit substances had increased
considerably in the last decade (1966-1976). This paper was based on the clinical
observations of 79 drug abusers: males 86.0 %, females 13.9 %; ages 15-35, mostly 1520 (79.7 %). In this group 94.9% came from regular homes and 5.0% from broken
homes. The economical level was high in 20.2 %, medium in 56.9 % and low in 22.7 %.
There was familial psychopathology in 71.0% of the subjects. The main reasons for
referral were school failure 35.4% , suicide attempt 17.7% , acute psychotic
intoxication 15.1 %, job desertion 13.9 %, depressive reaction 11.3 %, repeated fugues
7.5% . The great majority of persons abused marihuana (86.0% ). Other chemicals
ingested were LSD (36.7 %), emphetamines (22.7 %), coca or cocaine paste (8.8. %)
and cocaine hydrochloride (5.0 %).
Three years later buccal examination of drug abusers in Buenos Aires27
showed a connection between oral diseases and certain types of substances,
particularly amphetamines and marihuana. Male 20 year old patients had numerous

Section IL Epidemiology

211

caries, obturations and extractions. Thirty four percent suffered from gingivitis, 63 had
a saburrhal tongue, 8 % presented with leukoplakia and 5 % had dental prosthesis. All
these conditions were related to consumtpion of cannabis or amphetamines and poor
oral hygiène.
When the syndromes produced by coca or cocaine paste were described,
for the first time in the literatu re, it was noted that this substance, when dried, was
mixed with tobacco or marihuana so that it may ignite.
In another small series of polydrug abusers studies in Peru, it was
discovered that of 26 drug addicts 53.8 % used marihuana28.
A group of researchers studies chronic marihuana use in Costa Rica29.
The original sample consisted of 84 users and 156 non users, which after a year was
reduced to 41 users and 41 non users carefully matched. Users smoked the substance
mostly on a daily basis, for more than 10 years previous to their selection. Mean
marihuana consumption for 41 users was 9.6 cigarretes per day. All subjects were
male, living in the city’s working class residential areas. Users learned less money, had
more arrests, had been in jail or in the reformatory and had been reared bysurrogate
parents. They also changed jobs more frequently, worked in part time jobs or were
unemployed. Thirty nine effects were discribed by users, most were pleasant. Some
developed panic reactions, others euphoria (68.2% ). Unpleasant experiences were
also reported when mixing marihuana with alcohol. The great majority of users had
serious adjustment problems long before they began to use marihuana. They also
suffered from urinary and gastrointestinal symptoms. On examination they had lower
weight and showed more cases of pterigion and atrophy of one testicle, had more
surgical scars, lower levels of hemoglobin and signs of irritation of the anterior segment
of the eye. They had some EEG changes during sleep but no significant univariate or
multivariate differences were found on sixteen variables in a psychological test battery.

Following guidelines suggested by the World Health Organization many
epidemiological studies have been done in Central and South America to establish the
magnitude of the problem, the changing patterns and the corrective measures to be
applied. Thus in a survey done on 648 Peruvian university students87 it was found that
55 % had used marihuana at least once, occasionaly 37 % and frequently 15 %. Similar
results were found in high school students21. Once more cannabis was the most used
illicit substance: 16.43 % answered that they had tried at least once, 11.57 % were
occasional users and 4.85% were habitual consumers. Two other peruvian
researchers23 in a group of addicts admitted to public and private hospitals found that
marihuana (27 %) was only second to sedatives and barbiturates (36% ). Comparing
samples from four cities Negrete73 found that cannabis was used much more frequently
inToronto (31.3 %) than in Medellin (24.0 %), Sao Paolo (9.2 %) or Mexico (6.4 %).
In a home survey done in Lima marihuana was consumed at least once by
3.18% , also less frequently than sedatives66, a figure similar (3.0 %) to what was found
in high school students some years later58. In 1986 several investigations were done in
South America. De Carvalho60 applied an anonymous questionnaire to 2475 university
students of the Sao Paolo and discovered that cannabis had been employed by 41.2 %
of them at least once, 13.8% were occasional consumers and 4.2% were regular
macaonha smokers.
Several Government officials assembled in 1986 in Quito found that
cannabis was the illegal psychoactive drug most used in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia
and Peru33'34 until 1983, but after that year cocaine paste surpassed marihuana in

212

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

Bolivia, Peru and the northern sector of Colombia 42_43. Three years later the situation
had not changed much, marihuana continued to be the most used psychotropic
substance in Costa Rica, Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, The Bahamas, Peru
and Bolivia. However street children in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Peru began
drug experiences with inhalants followed by coca (cocaine) paste in Bolivia, Colombia
and Peru, while in Mexico marihuana followed the use of inhalants, and later heroin or
cocaine hydrochloride70'77.
In 1990 several Latin American epidemiologists met in San Antonio,
Texas, to compare recent investigations in their own countries. Brazil reported that
high school and university students preferred inhalants, benzodiazepines,
amphetamines and cannabis40. Some used syntetic cholinergic but very few used
cocaine66'78'82. Brazilian street children preferred inhalants, cannabis and
anticholinergics40. Comparing student and addicts it was found that the former
smoked maconha (2.9% in 1987 and 3.4% in 1989) while people in hospitale were
mostly depend on cannabis (31.1 %) in 1987 and 29.4 % in 1989).
In emergency Rooms in Buenos Aires37'38 cocaine and marihuana (10%
each) citations were only secondary to alcohol (65 %).
Another epidemiologic investigation conducted in Ecuador77 interviewing
6000 individuals found outlawed drug used at least once in the following proportions:
marihuana 4 %, inhalants 2 %, native plants 1 %, cocaine 1 %.
In Mexico several surveys done in schools, factories, prisons and homes
showed in the seventies predominance of marihuana everywhere68. Home surveys done
in 1974 - 1985 demonstrated that the commonly abused substances were barbiturates
and marihuana72. Heroin and cocaine was abused in Northwest Mexico80. In 1986
marihuana was the main drug of abuse in Northern mexican students. Between 1986
and 1988 national rates increased significantly for inhalants, amphetamines and
marihuana80. Another group also found, in the same country, that the most common
illegal drug used was marihuana71.
In Peru several surveys also showed that the predominant drug of abuse
was marihuana from the sixties to the eighties 21>23>25. After 1980 the preferred illegal
substances were coca (cocaine) paste and cocaine hydrochloride39'86.
In Venezuela a high school survey (sample 21 842 students, 9 456 males,
12 386 females) showed that the most frequently abused substances by the 11 -13 years
old were glue and solvants. Use of marihuana, cocaine and basuko (coca paste)
increased with age. Marihuana 11-13 years old 0.6% , 14-17 years 2.2% , older than
18 years 5.6 %. In the last six months marihuana was consumed by 3.3 % in males and
by 1.3 % in females 65.
In over 600 peruvian addicts to coca (cocaine) paste and cocaine
hydrochloride it was found that before using those substances 305 patients (49.5% )
had smoked marihuana. When dependent on cocaine twenty six individuals preferred
using paste mixed with marihuana, while 18 usually combined, in one session, cocaine
hydrochloride with coca paste mixed with cannabis. Thus 44 subjects continued to
smoke marihuana while addicted to coca paste or cocaine39.
A home survey done in 1988 in Peru (5 195 houses) showed that
marihuana had been tried by 4 % of the urban population of 12 to 50 years old being
particularly preferred by man (10.7 %) than by women (1.3 %). Most consumers were
20-39 years old and had university education (12.6% ) superior non university
education (5.3 %), high school education (4.5 %) and elementary education (1.3 %).
Though marihuana was the most consumed illegal drug it seemed that it was becoming
less fashionable, according to the authoress79, when comparing the results of the 1988

Section IL Epidemiology

213

survey with the 1986 investigation69. In 1986 it was used at least once by 8.3 % of the
population, in 1988 it had descended to 5.3 %.
Recently teenagers were selected by mexican investigators41 from a file of
the National Addiction Survey and identified 1 475 subjects 14-17 years old. Most
consumed marihuana (63.5 %) and inhalants (33.3 %). The use of two or more illicit
drugs was reported by 24.2 % of the subjects. Of these individuals who consumed two
drugs 71.4% employed marihuana and inhalants and almost a third (28.6% ) used
cocaine and marihuana. Teenagers 16-17 years old consumed drugs twice as much as
those aged 14-15.

Though cannabis sativa probably originated wild in the level grounds of
the Altaj Mountains in Central Asia, it was cultivated by the Chinese and Indian
peoples and soon its use, as a ceremonial and religious incense, was extended to many
oriental territories. Later it was discovered that its many preparations could be eaten,
smoked and drank. Conquest migration and travel spread its use to the Middle East
and to Northern and Western Africa. When America was discovered cannabis was
introduced by the Spaniards to the new colonies (Mexico, Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica,
Colombia, Peru, Chile) with the purpose of establishing the hemp industry. The
Portuguese very early in the sixteenth century, brought thousand of slaves from Guinea
to Brazil. These people (Malinka, Yoruba, Balante, Fulani, Mandyako, Pepel and
others) brought their religious costumes and practices, including cannabis smoking
which was called maconha from thence.
Cannabis need w warm dry climate and adequate moisture in the soil.
Thus it had been cultivated in the Lower Himalayas, the Rif sector of Morocco and
Mount Lebanon. In the new world it was extensively grown in almost all Central and
Northern South American countries (the Antilles, Mexico, Colombia and Brazil).
Hundred of years before its use was extended to the west and south em
regions of the United States, cannabis was smoked in Mexico and Brazil. In the
nineteenth century marihuana use was prevalent in the Atlantic coast of Honduras,
Jamaica, Haiti and Santo Domingo.Finally the inhabitants of those countries, when
they emigrated to Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama and California, they introduced the
habit to Black Americans, musicians and performers, as is well Known.
In south America the psychotropic effects of cannabis smoking were well
known by the middle of the nineteenth century9, but it was by the clinical work of
Brazilian physicians that the acute and toxic disorders produced by marihuana were
reported to the rest of Spanish speaking doctors of Latin America11'1 .
Before the marihuana epidemic of the sixtees acquired explosive
characteristics, cannabis used increased considerably in Brazil, Central America and
Mexico. Intensive users developed many types of mental disorders in those countries,
as well as in Colombia and Peru.
It is very difficult to compare clinical work of different physicians, in
different countries, with different patients. However some results are similar in diverse
environments. For example M. Souief, Professor of Psychology at the University of
Cairo, did a psychosocial study of 850 hashish users and 839 controls84, he found
among hashish users that there was a definite pattern of oscillation of temperamental
traits, swinging between two opposite poles: that of social case, acquiecence and
elation under the immediate effects of the drug; and that of ascendancy, seclusiviness,
negativism, depression and pugnacity when the subject was deprived of it. Concerning
the various tests given to the volunteers it was found that the more educated the user,

214

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

the greater the impairment caused by the drug. While an illeterate peasant might
perform five percent less efficiently than a non smoking control of the sam educational
background, a man with equivalent of grade school education might do thirty percent
less well than his smoking counterpart. It seemed therefore that the drug was more
taxing on those who have most to lose.
In another cosmopolitan setting, children and adolescents who had high
intelligence and special abilities, representing a group whose potential was of greatest
jersonal and social value, rapidly showed inhibition of learning, thought
iragmentation, loss of fluency of verbal expression, alienation, lack of motivation and
direction, depression and confusion31. The tendancy to employ other drugs after the
inicial encounter with marihuana was also confirmed, as well as the development of
acute and chronic psychoses. In a smaller town at least five different kinds of
psychoses associated with marihuana were documented30.

f

In areas where heavy cannabis consumption is prevalent, in dispossed
and illiterate people,toxic psychoses are frequent. In Morocco for example one
clinician reported on 140 cases of toxic psychotic reactions. These mental disturbances
were very short, with autonomic symptoms and changes of mood varying from
euphoria to depression, sometimes with agresive outbursts and associated with vivid
hallucinations23. More elaborate work, done in South Africa, comparing 20 psychotic
men who had urinary cannabinoid levels on admission with 20 psychotic men free of
cannabis, showed in the former significant more hypomania and agitation and
significantly less affective flattening, auditory hallucinations and incoherence of
speech than did the controls. After one week the cannabis group showed marked
improvement whereas the controls remained virtually unchanged. They concluded that
a high intake of cannabis may be related to a rapid resolving psychosis manifesting
marked hypomanic features, though often presenting as schizophrenia like illness32.
In our report we observed six psychotic disorders in 36 children and
adolescents. Four psychotic patients recovered rapidly, while two remaided psychotic
for over a year. The paranoid psychoses resembled schizophrenia25. Acute and chronic
cannabis psychoses have been also documented by brazilian, and Colombian
investigators.
In Costa Rica 41 chronic users who smoked marihuana for at least ten
years, about 9 cigarettes per day, showed no significant mental changes, as judged by
a neuropsychological battery of 16 variables, when compared with 41 controls. They
admitted that acute psychotic reactions could occur with heavy consumption but
doubted that chronic use could affect the higher cortical functions29. The tests were
applied by three psychologists. These results are contradicted by clinical and
comparative studies done by many investigators16,22,24'26,30'32’34’40. Carter excluded
users who had any physical or psychological disorder and he commented that
sociocultural and idiosyncratic conditions may contribute to pathological findings in
other studies.
Clinical investigators regularly take account of genetic, constitutional,
environmental, physical and characterological conditions of every subject, as well as
the psychoactive substances consumed. But irrespective of economical, cultural or
social factors, it has been demostrated repeteadly that high doses of cannabis,
ingested acutely or chronically, can produce objective psychopathological disorders22'
26,30-32,37,40

Carter also wrote that his chronic cannabic users were not interested in
other drugs29, apart from tobacco and alcohol, but this assessment is against
contradicted by the patients seen by many clinical investigators11'26,30'32. In fact, it is
well known by any person who has experience with drug dependent patients in the last
30 years, that cannabis is frequently the first psychoactive substance followed sooner

Section II. Epidemiology

215

or later by LSD, heroin, mescaline, cocaine or designer drugs, whatever is the current
fashion in the subculture21,25’35,39,40,46,51,59.
Concerning basic research, 31 years ago a pharmacologist considered
that Colombia’s worst social problem was cannabis smoking. He administered
marihuana extracts to several small mammals and found that after a period of
stimulation followed a period of depression, which lasted several hours. He described
catalespsy when the extract was administered intraperitonsally55.
In Panama three researchers injected several concentrations of
marihuana extracts diluted with sesame oil to 2400 hen eggs and only sesame oil to
2400 control eggs. Embryos injected with cannabis showed a 90 % developmental
delay, 80 % had malformations of the spinal cord and 70 % damage to otocytes and
eyes, 15 % developped as double monsters. Higher concentrations produced more
malformations. They concluded that marihuana has teratogenic effects in the
development of chick embryos52. In these experiments there was no possibility of
maternal toxicity53 nor were they limited to a few days of observation54.
Five per cent of emergencies seen recently at three general hospitals in
Buenos Aires were associated with psychoactive substances of abuse: alcoholic 65 %,
cannabis 10 %, cocaine 10 %. Marihuana and cocaine were often found in combination
with alcohol and with other drugs37. Lack of education, unemployment and marital
separation were important factors for men to abuse drugs, while for woman personal
crises predisponed them to over doses38. In Mexico the Information Reporting System
(Health and Justice) found that the most common used drugs were marihuana (6475 %) and solvent inhalants71.
In the same country the surveillance system of addictions was applied to
three high risk groups: teenagers, juvenile délinquants and people living in slums41.
The most consumed drugs were marihuana (63,5 %) and inhalants (33,3 %) in the first
group. In juvenile reformatories marihuana was the first drug of choice, ages of
onset 9-19 for 51 % of the subjects. Marihuana and inhalants were also predominant in
the shantytowns.
These studies, as well as those done in general and psychiatric hospitals,
probably mean that home and school surveys, done by questionnaires, are
underreporting the current drug use in Latin American countries. However even today
use of drugs by those nations probably is less prevalent that what occurs in the United
States, Canada65,79'82 and Europe.
In the future it would be convenient that all countries should adopt a
similar procedure to assess drug abuse patterns and trends at yearly intervals,
considering a variety of sources such as: (1) Drug related deaths reported by medical
examiners, morgues, local coroners and public health agencies; (2) Drug related
emergency room episodes in general and specialized hospitals; (3) Primary substances
of abuse reported by patients at admission to treatment facilities; (4) urinary drug
analysis done to people arrested by the Judiciary System for delinquent activities,
disordered
conduct
or
bizarre
behaviour;
(5) Seizure,
price,
purity,
prescription/distribution and arrest data from national, state or local law enforcement
agencies; and (6) Other city specific data gathered from ethnographic research,
surveys, criminal justice and correctional sources, public health sources, and other
sources unique to local areas85. Reports of drug abuse in general were summarized in
Brasil18 and Peru83. Recent reviews of cannabis use in Brasil were published a decade
ago45, an excellent study on the health effects followed two years later47 and a study on
the epidemiological surveys done in 12 Latin American countries44.
In conclusion, it can be said that cannabis has been used in Latin
American for several centuries, that it was introduced to the United States in the

The Epidemiology of Adolescent Drug Use
in France and Israel*
D e n i s e B. KANDEL, Is r a e l ADLER, a n d M y r i a m

SUDIT**

Abstract - Based on samples of adolescents residing in urban areas in France and in Israel, cross- cultural comparisons of adolescent use of alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and illicit drugs are re­
ported. Lifetime and current prevalences of use of all substances are higher in France than in Israel.
The relative ranking of the prevalence of use of the various drugs is identical in the two countries,
and is similar to that found in American samples. In both countries, drug use is more prevalent
among males than females, and among older than younger adolescents. There are no differences
among different socio-economic groups. Religiosity affects of non — alcoholic substances and the
amounts of alcoholic beverages consumed in Israel. Differences in the prevalence of substance use
across culture decrease as overall prevalence of use increases( Public Health 1981 ; 71 : 256-265.).
Drug use in adolescence has been extensively studied from epidemiological, sociological and psycho­
logical perspectives in recent years. The number of studies reflects the growing social concern with
substance use and its presumed causes and consequences. While such concern is growing in many
countries, few epidemiological cross-cultural data are currently available. This paper presents data
from two surveys of adolescents in France and in Israel.
Analyses carried out earlier in the United States indicated that the uses of legal and illegal
drugs*** are closely interrelated1-2 and that involvement in illicit drugs is preceded by the use of legal
drugs3. Alcohol was found to play a crucial step in the developmental sequence of adolescent drug
involvement from non-use to use of illegal substances with beer and wine as the entry drugs, fol­
lowed by cigarettes a n d /o r hard liquor. Some individuals progress to marihuana : and almost no ad­
olescent progresses to other illicit drugs without having used marihuana. An important issue, there­
fore, is whether differences also in the use of other drugs in cultures where wide differences exist in
the use of alcoholic beverages. France and Israel were selected for comparative analysis because of
the apparent striking differences in patterns of alcohol consumption in the two countries. Although
no systematic cross-cultural epidemiological data exist on general populations self-reported patterns
of alcohol consumption, such as sales volume of alcohol and indicators of alcohol-related disabilities.
Israel has one of the lowest rates in the Western world; France has one the highest rates4-5. In 1972,
France had an apparent consumption of 23.43 1. of absolute alcohol per capita, as compared with
3.25 1. in Israel in 1974, and 10. ,48 in the United States in 19756.
For both Israel and France, there exist almost no epidemiological data on drug use (whether to­
bacco, alcohol or illicit drugs) either by adolescents or by adults7 9. To the best of our knowledge, to

*** The use of certain substances is illegal throughout the western world, and includes drugs used for
recreational purposes, such as marijuana, LSD or heroin, or psychoactive drugs, such as the tranqui­
lizers, stimulants and barbiturates, when used without medical prescription. Alcoholic beverages
and cigarettes can be legally used bu adults and are usually classified as “ legal” substances, even
when restrictions exist for adolescents. The legal age for alcohol use in France is 18. There are no age
restrictions on alcohol use in Israel.

date only two studies o f adolescent drug use have been carried out in France. In 1971, Davidson 10 11
examined smoking, drinking, and the use of medically prescribed psychoactive drugs among 2,339
high school students aged 16-19 in three regions of France. A survey of drinking practices was con­
ducted on a representative sample of 1,535 French youths 15 — 19 years old by the Institut de Recherches Scientifiques Economiques et Sociales sur les Boissons (I R E B )12 a private association of
manufacturers of liquor interested in promoting safe drinking. None of these studies asked about the
use of marihuana or other illicit drugs*.
In Israel, two adolescent studies have reported about the use of cigarettes and hashish. Peled ques­
tioned 3,000 students, randomly selected in 1971 from 20 high schools in the four major urban cen­
ters of Israel13’ 14. In 1973, Shoham, et al, contacted 416 students in four high schools in different
parts of Israel15. In neither study were questions asked about drinking. A still unpublished study by
Shuval and Javetz inquired in 1979 about the use of legal and illegal drugs by over 6,000 seventh
through twelfth grade students.
Three epidemiological studies of drinking practices among adults were carried out in France in
1955-195916. Since then, however, among adults only one departmental survey17 and an unpublished
national study by I R E B 18 have been carried out, despite the fact that alcoholism is one of the fore­
most public health problems in France (see also reference 19). Similarly, despite the long standing
interest in the low rates of alcoholism among Jews, there is But one recent limited survey of drinking
in the general population in Israel20.
A major goal of the current research was to obtain epidemiological data on substance use by ado­
lescents in France and in Israel.

M ETHODS
SAMPLES

Two adolescent household surveys of urban youth 14 to 18 years of age were carried out. The French
sample includes 499 French adolescents representative of 14 through 18 years old youths in the Pari­
sian metropolitan area (Paris and suburbs) interviewed in Spring 1977. The field work was carried
out by the Institut Français d’Opinion Publique. The Israeli sample included 609 Israeli adolescents,
14 through 18 years of age, residing in the four major urban centers in Israel (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv,
Haïfa, and Beer Sheba) interviewed in Spring 1979. The field work was carried out by the Israel In­
stitute of Applied Social Research, in Jerusalem. Both samples are urban, and as such not selected to
be representative of the countries as a whole. The completion rate in the Israeli sample is about 90
per cent. The French sample was collected as a quota sample, based on respondents age, sex , and
student status. Various demographic characteristics of the sample (including parents occupations)
were similar to those in the the target population. In both samples, data were collected with struc­
tured interview schedules administered in households. The schedules are based on an instrument
developed for an earlier American adolescent study22. Efforts were made to include identical ques­
tions in both instruments, although modifications were introduced to incorporate country-specific
conditions. The list of alcoholic beverages included certain beverages available in one country but
not the other. Religiosity was measured by a different question in each country. Translation and
back-translation were carried out to ensure standardization across cultures. Pre-tests of 18 and 30 in­
terviews were carried out in France and in Israel, respectively.
Both samples are almost equally distributed on sex (53 per cent males in the French sample and 49

* A new study by Davidson43 appeared after the present article was accepted for publication. The
survey was carried out in 1978-79 on 2,088 high school students drawn from the same three regions in
France as in the earlier 1971 survey. Questions were asked about the use of tobacco, alcoholic bever­
ages and “ drugs”. Seven percent of the high school students reported any lifetime experience with
any illicit drug.

cent. Since adolescent drug behavior is strongly age-related23, the data were age-adjusted. All obser­
vations were weighted so as to create a uniform distribution for each category on the age variable in
each country. All sample sizes in the Tables are the unweighted totals.
OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS

We focus upon three dimensions of drug use :1) ever use, 2) current use, i.e ., use in the month prior
to the interview, and 3) lifetime frequency of use for each drug. With the exceptions noted below,
the same questions were asked for all drugs in both surveys. The drugs inquired about are listed in
Table 1.
The pertinent items in the Israeli and the French questionnaires were :l)«H o w frequently have
you ever used... ?» with categories ranging from “never used” to “used 60 or more times” for alco­
hol and marihuana, and to “used ten or more times” for other illicit drugs ; and 2) “How frequently
have you used... in the past month ? ” with categories ranging from “never used in past m onth” to
“ used more than once daily. ” Because a pilot study in Israel had revealed very low rates of lifetime
prevalence of illicit drug use, the Israeli questionnaire did not contain questions regarding the cur­
rent use of these drugs. The smoking question was phrased somewhat differently and asked : “ How
often do you smoke cigarettes ? ” with categories ranging from “ never smoked,” “only smoked once
or twice,” “used to smoke but stopped,” “smoke occasionally,” “smoke less than a pack a d ay ,” and
“smoke a pack a day or more. ” The last three categories were combined to arrive at estimates of cur­
rent smokers.

Although the same drugs were asked about in each country, adjustments were made in the alco­
holic beverages to reflect the range of beverages consumed in each country. In France, questions
were included about cider ; and “ apéritifs” and "digestifs” were specified among distilled spirits. In
Israel, “white beer” was specified to avoid confusion with a non-alcoholic beverage known as “black
beer.”we also distinguished ritualistic and non-ritualistic uses of wine in Israel. Our reporting will be
confined to non-ritualistic use.
Both measures of use were dichotomized into “user” and “ non-user” categories. Comparing re­
sponses to these two items provides a measure of reliability. As in American samples
we find a
very high degree of correspondence between the two sets of responses. The French sample includes
only one case (0 ,2 per cent) with discrepant responses to the two items on any of the drugs. In the
Israel sample, the rate of inconsistent responses ranges from 1,5 per cent for hard liquor to 7,2 per
cent for wine.*

RESULTS
The data pertain to two major topics : 1) epidemiological trends in lifetime and current prevalences,
and extent of life-time experience with various classes of drugs : and 2 ) the socio-demographic corre­
lates of patterns of use.
LIFETIME AND CURRENT PREVALENCES

From the rates of reported lifetime prevalence of drug use for the total age-standardized samples in
Table 1, several trends are readily apparent. First, for all drugs, the rates of reported use in France
exceed those in Israel. These differences are relatively small in the use of beer and wine, are larger
with respect to hard liquor and cigarettes, and are highest in the use of illicit drugs, except tranquiliz­
ers. With one exception, the relative magnitude of these differences is inversely related to the overall
prevalence of use of the various drugs : the higher the reported rate of use. the smaller the difference
between the rates reported in each country. For cigarettes, however, the difference is somewhat
higher than one would expect on the basis of its overall prevalence.
The relative prevalence of use of the various substances is very similar in the two countries. Beer
and wine** are reported to have been used by more young people than hard liquor, and the reported
rate of use of all legal drugs exceeds that of all illegal drugs. The only difference between the two
countries pertains to cigarettes. Whereas in France the use of cigarettes is higher than that of all alco­
holic beverages except cider, in Israel the rate of cigarette use is lower than that of all alcoholic bev­
erages. In this respect, the order of the various drugs in Israel resembles that in the United States23 25
(see also Table 6 ). The lifetime prevalence of use of the illegal drugs in Israel is exceedingly small
and is nil for three drug classes : psychedelics, amphetamines, and heroin***. In France, the use of
marihuana is almost four times as great as use of the next illicit drug, replicating trends in American
surveys23. Combining the use of one or more illicit drugs into a single variable, “ever use of any illicit
drug”, clearly confirms the patterns noted above across the two countries and within each country.
In both countries, the use of any illicit drug is less prevalent than the use of any of the licit substan­
ces, and the differences are larger in Israel than in France.
In line with definitions used in American studies, “current” use was defined as any use during the
past 30 days preceding the surveys.
For all drugs, the proportions of youth who have used the drug in the past 30 days is much smaller
than the proportion having ever used it. The relative rankings in current prevalence (see Table 1).

* In line with analyses of inconsistent responses in earlier American studies, respondents who repor­
ted currently using a given drug were classified as having ever used it.
** In Israel, the proportion having used wine for ritualistic purposes (83 per cent) is higher than the
proportion using non-ritualistically.
***T he percentages (3 per cent) of Israeli adolescents reporting having used hashish and/or mari­
juana in 1979 is similar ta the percentages of users (5 per cent and 4 per cent) identified in two earlier
Israeli studies carried out in 197114 and 197315.

The French data illustrate also that current use of illicit drugs is much lower than current use of the
licit substances.
The cross-cultural differences observed between Israel and France in the lifetime prevalence of all
drugs persist and are accentuated in the measures of current use. On all drugs in which a comparison
is possible, the reported rates of current use are at least twice as high in the French sample as they
are in the Israeli (see the ratios of current to ever users in Table 1)
The lifetime and current prevalence data presented above include in the user category adolescents
who have experimented with a given drug once or twice, as well as those who have used it more fre­
quently. The number of times French and Israeli youths have ever used each of the various drugs is
presented in Table 2, with response distributions among the total samples in each country, as well as
the conditional distributions among those who ever used each substance. Since the information re­
garding ever use was supplemented by information on current use, as described above, the percen­
tages of “ never use” in Table 2 are not always the complements of the proportions of ever use re­
ported in Table 1.
In France, about one-fourth of tho§e who have ever used the various alcoholic beverages have
used them only once or twice : between one-sixth and one-fourth have used these substances 60 or
more times. These result stand in sharp contrast to those observed in the Israeli sample, where one
observes a much lower percentage of heavy involvement in alcoholic substances (see Table 2 ). Sim­
ilar cross-cultural differences appear with respect to cigarette smoking : 63 per cent of the adoles­
cents who ever smoked are no longer smoking in Israel as compared to 24 per cent in France, 3 per
cent vs 12 per cent are currently smoking a pack or more a day, and 12 per cent vs 35 per cent smoke
less than a pack of cigarettes a day.
In France, the use of marihuana is more experimental than the use of legal drugs. A very low per­
centage of adolescents report the use of marihuana 40 or more times. The use of illicit drugs other
than marihuana is rare and the most experimental of all. Among Israeli adolescents, use of marihua­
na a n d /o r hashish is less experimental than the use of wine and hard liquor. However, the size of
the groups reporting use of other illicit drugs is very small, so that any inferences based on these sub­
samples must be very tentative.
These results suggest that , for those drugs for which prevalence rates make a comparison possible
(i.e ., the various alcoholic beverages, cigarettes and marihuana), not only do French adolescents
experiment with these drugs more extensively than the Israelis, but also once they start experiment­
ing with a particular substance, they are more likely than the Israelis to remain users. A similar con­
clusion was reached in a discussion of results on an earlier United States sample : “ Substances with
the highest overall rates of ever use are also those which are used most recently and most regularly,
except for a reversal between marihuana and hard liquor”26.
DEMOGRAPHIC CORRELATES

A ge. In both countries, for almost every single drug, rates of use increase monotonically with age
(see Table 3) While slight reversals in these trends occur, the highest rates of use are consistently ob­
served in the oldest cohort and the lowest rates in the youngest one.
The cross-cultural differences in prevalence of drug use observed in the total youth samples pre­
vale in all age groups. Furthermore, the differences in rates of use of illicit drugs between Israeli and
French adolescents increase with age. Whereas in the younger cohorts (14 and 15 year olds), the re­
ported rates of ever use are about 2.4 times larger in France than in Israel, the rates are 3.5 and 4.0
times larger in the older cohorts (17 and 18 year olds, respectively). The rate by which use of any
illicit drug increases with age in the adolescent years is much larger in France than in Israel.
Sex. Consistents sex differences exist with regard to use of all drugs (Table 4 ). With two excep­
tions, in both countries, the reported rates of lifetime experience with all drugs are higher for males
than for females. The exceptions involve the use of barbiturates and tranquillizers, where sex differ­
ences either completely disappear (tranquillizers in France, barbiturates in Israel). Consistent with
this trend is the finding that in France the sex differences in the use of barbiturates are smaller than
for any of the other illicit drugs, except the tranquillizers.
The same cross-cultural trends appear for the sex differences as were described for the age differ­
ences. The sex differences are greater in Israel than in France, and they are inversely related to the
overall prevalence of use of the various substances.

respondent’s family of origin and was dichotomized according to whether or not the father had com­
pleted high school. There is no consistent relationship between adolescent drug use and father’s edu­
cation in either country. Whatever differences are observed between the two educational levels are
extremely small (data not presented).
Religiosity* — Much has been written about the role of religious affiliation and relieiosity in
modulating drinking patterns and alcoholism rates21*27 31. The drinking behavior of Jews in particular
has been the subject of intense analyses. One popular thesis is that Jews as a distinct sociocultural
group are characterized both by low rates of abstinence from alcohol and low rates of alcoholism and
problem drinking21-30-31. In addition, there may be variations among Jews that are associated with re­
ligious orthodoxy, the more orthodox exhibiting lower rates of abstention and of alcoholism than the
less orthodox. These findings first reported by Snyder,21 however, were not replicated by Knupfer

• Analyses were also carried out among Israeli adolescents of different ethnic backgrounds. There is
an ethnic differentiation in the types of substance used rather than the overall prevalence of use.
Youths with fathers bom in Israel are characterized by relatively high rates of use of wine and
liquor ; those with fathers from Asia / Africa by beer ; and those with fathers drom Europe / Am e­
rica are slightly higher in the use of cigarettes than the other two groups. The proportions having
consumed beer, wine, hard liquor or cigarettes are respectively : 64 per cent, 71 per cent, 59 per cent
and 41 per cent, in the Israel group ; and 74 per cent, 57 per cent, 49 per cent and 43 per cent in the
Asia / Africa group ; and 70 per cents, 63 per cent, 51 per cent and 46 per cent in the Europe / Am e­
rica group

and Room30. In neither study was a distinction established between drinking for ritualistic and for
non-ritualistic purposes.
Because France and Israel each are characterized by a single religion, we could only investigate
the role of religiosity on substance use by adolescents in each country. The cross-cultural consump­
tion patterns discussed above illustrate that as a group Israeli adolescents have much lower rates of
use of all substances than the French, except as regards the drinking of wine for ritualistic purposes.
If such drinking is taken into account, the lifetime experience with wine is more prevalent among Is­
raelis than among French adolescents.
The lifetime and current rates of use of substances by religiosity are presented in Table 5. In the
Israeli sample, religiosity is indexed by type of school attended;* in France, by frequency of attend­
ance at religious services. French adolescents who report attending services more than once a month
are classified as religious. The data clearly demonstrate the inhibiting effects of religiosity on the use
of all drugs in France.
A more complex pattern is displayed among Israeli adolescents. Religiosity appears to inhibit the
use of cigarettes, hashish/marihuana and other illicit drugs, as well as beer. The differences are
smaller as regards the drinking of wine for non-ritualistic purposes, and they are completely reversed
as regards the use of distilled spirits : a higher proportion of religious than of non-religious Israeli ad­
olescents report having consumed hard liquor ever in their lives or within the last month. The effect
of religiosity in Israel manifests itself most strongly not in the frequency of drinking experiences but
in the amounts of alcohol consumed at any one sitting. These differences appear for each of the three
alcoholic substances, including hard liquor. Religious youths consistently consume fewer alcoholic
beverages than the non-religious. On any one occasion, 12 per cent of the non-religious as compared
to 5 per cent of the religious report having consumed more than one can of beer : 25 per cent vs 14
per cent drank more than one glass of wine : 12 per cent vs 6 per cent drank more than one glass of li­
quor.
Thus, within the broader cross-cultural differences in which Jews as a group are less likely to re­
port use of any kinds of substances than the French, including alcoholic beverages, religiosity ap­
pears to modulate drinking experiences along the lines suggested by previous investigators : among
Jews, religiosity is associated with lower rates of abstinence of those alcoholic substances that are as­
sociated with religious observances, such as wine and hard liquor, but lower consumption of any al­
coholic beverages at any one sitting. In both countries, religiosity is associated with reduced experi­
mentation with illicit substances.

DISCUSSION
Patterns of drug use among adolescents in France and Israel display both differences as well as close
similarities. The overall order in the lifetime and current prevalences of use of the legal and illegal
drugs is identical in both countries. The legal drugs are used by a larger proportion of the youth pop­
ulation than the illegal drugs, marihuana is used much more frequently than any of the other illicit
drugs, and females are more likely than males to use tranquillizers and sedatives. However, while all
four legal drugs have been tried by similar proportions of the French adolescents, the Israeli adoles­
cents are much less likely to have smoked or to have drunk hard liquor than they are to have drunk
beer or wine.
The most striking cross-cultural differences, however, appear in the overall lifetime and current
use prevalences of use of all drugs, in the extent of use, and in the age-and-sex-specific rates of use in
Israel and in France. French youths uniformly report higher lifetime and current use of all the sub­
stances investigated in the study, as well as more extensive drug involvement, than the Israeli youths.
In comparing cross-cultural rates of use of various drugs, two alternate consumption patterns
could emerge. The high rate of use of one substance, especially alcohol, in a culture could indicate a
general positive attitude about the taking of drugs that would be reflected in all aspects of drug tak-

* The Israeli educational system, which is under government control, consists of two parallel subsys­
tems : a religious and a non-religious one. Students are free to choose the type of school attended in
any place in the country ; those in religious schools attend services daily in school.

ing, such that rates of use of all drugs would be uniformly low or uniformly high. On the other hand,
in a culture characterized by a low rate of use of a particular substance, there could be a process of
compensation such that the low rate of use of that substance would be paralled by a high rate of use
of another substance. If only the French and Israeli data were available for consideration, the first
interpretation would appear to be supported. For every substance that was investigated, the French
adolescents have higher prevalence of use than the Israelis. Thus, there appears to be an “ addition”
rather than a “substitution” effect. Sulkunen first developed these contrasting concepts to interpret
the uses of various alcoholic beverages in different societies.4. In particular, he drew upon the results
of the classic social experiment in Norwegian rural areas, where the introduction of new low alcohol­
ic beverages constituted additional opportunities for use that became superimposed on former drink­
ing patterns rather than replaced them.32 The same general principles may be extended to other sub­
stances than the different alcoholic beverages.
However, the introduction of the United States as a third comparative case illustrates the com­
plexity of the phenomenon. France, Israel, and the United States represent three especially interest­
ing cases for cross-cultural comparisons. Each country falls into a different category in the various
typologies of drinking cultures that have been developed. According to Pittman’s typology of cul­
tures based on attitudes about drinking,33 Israel is classified as “permissive,” . France as “over-per­
missive,” and the United States as “ ambivalent” In the typology suggested by Sulkunen, based on
the preferred alcoholic beverage,4 Israel is characterized as a distilled spirits culture, France as a
wine-consuming country, and the United States as a beer culture. Our data suggest that each coun­
try, in turn, appears also to display different patterns of adolescent substance use.
American data are introduced for comparison from a study carried out in 1978 by the New York
State Division of Substance Abuse Services on a sample of New York State high school students,25
in an historical period comparable to the French and Israeli studies (see Table 6 ). The New York
State-wide American sample, however, includes adolescents from a variety of ecological areas.
In the same period, French adolescents exhibit as high (o r even higher) rates of use of licit drugs as
the Americans but much lower rates of illicit use. The American sample has much higher rates of il­
licit drugs than either of the other two countries. The national differences are striking. For example,
64 per cent of American adolescents had used marihuana in 1978 as compared to 23 per cent of the
French in 1977, and 3 per cent of the Israelis in 1979. Thus, all cultures cannot be unambiguously or­
dered with respect to overall prevalence of drug use. Countries may be at various stages of evolution
as far as specific drug use patterns are concerned. Because of the much higher prevalence of the use
of legal drugs in France in Israel, the prospects for further large increases in the use of illicit use
would seem to be much more favorable in the former than in the latter.
These data also suggest that the same ethnic or cultural group may behave quite differently in dif­
ferent social contexts (see also Room9 for a similar point). While Israeli adolescents have the lowest
overall prevalence of use of all substances among all three nations, in the United States, Jewish ado­
lescents have the highest rates of use of illicit drugs1*22, and Jews have the lowest abstaining rates for
alcohol27-30*31.
Irrespective of overall levels of use, in every culture the uses of legal and illegal drugs are highly
interrelated. In France, as in the United States, *•2 marihuana users are more likely than non-mari­
huana users to have used each of the legal drugs (see Table 7 ). In addition, there is a direct and strik­
ing relationship between degree of involvement in legal drugs and involvement with marihuana.
Thus, the proportion of French adolescents who report having used hard liquor at least 40 times in
their lifetime ranges from 13 per cent among those who have never used marihuana to 86 per cent
among those who have used it 40 or more times.
We conclude that despite wide marginal differences in the use of drugs in various cultures, unifor­
mities appear in the relationship of drug use to sociodemographic variables : drug use increases
through the adolescent years, there are more male than female adolescents using each type of drug,
and there is no consistent association between drug use and the adolescent’s socioeconomic status34.
These uniformities, appearing in societies characterized by widely divergent patterns of use, indicate
that drug use shares certain basic features that are not affected by cultural specifics.
Trends appearing in these epidemiological findings suggest important policy implications. There
may be a systematic relationship between overall prevalence of drug use in a culture and certain re­
lated aspects of drug behavior.In particular, overall prevalence of the use of drugs in a culture ap­
pears to be associated with two social processes : 1) a greater and more persistent involvement in
drugs, as reflected in the proportion of adolescents who remain current users among those who ever

started experimenting with a drug (Table 6 ), and in the frequency of lifetime use among users of
each drug (Table 2 ) ; and 2) in addition, increased overall prevalence appears to be associated with a
spread of the phenomenon throughout all groups in society, such that group differences in drug ex­
periences are attenuated, as witnessed by the decreased sex and age differences in drug use patterns
in France as comp'ared to Israel.
The implications of these findings are reminiscent of the distribution model of alcoholism. Origi­
nally proposed by Lederman35 ,the distribution model assumes that the number o f alcoholics or
heavy drinkers in a society is related to the overall consumption of alcohol in that society and in­
creases multiplicatively with per capita consumption levels36 37. Although this model is not without
its critics38, it seems to be quite robust39-41. It must be stressed that the data presented in this paper do
not deal with the epidemiology of alcoholism, problem drinking, addiction, or problem drug use. It
is dubious that such cases can even be captured in any large numbers in epidemiological surveys of
general populations42. The measure of drug involvement that we analyzed, i.e, lifetime frequencies
of drug experience, is a gross measure of involvement. However, those cross — cultural data do
suggest a relatively conservative position with regard to accessibility and availability of substances.
Both for legal and illegal drugs, persistence and degrees of involvement may be directly related to
the overall prevalence of consumption levels in the society. Much remains to be learned about the
factors, especially the sociocultural factors, that may explain these broad societal differences in over­
all consumption patterns.

STAGE IN ADOLESCENT INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG USE

(Kandel ZX, Science, 190:912,1975)

This diagram illustrates the successive stages in adolescent drug
use observed in two follow-up surveys ("longitudinal”) o f 5,468 New
York State High School students between fall 1971 and spring
1972, and of 985 seniors 5 months after graduation. Students start
use of legal drugs, beer or wine, and go on to the smoking of
cigarettes and drinking of hard liquor. While 27 percent of students
who smoke and drink progress to marijuana within a 5 to 6 month
follow-up period, only 2 percent of those who did not drink or smoke
previously do so. Marijuana in turn is a critical step on the way to
other illicit drugs: while 26 percent of marijuana users will
experiment with L.S.D., amphetamines and opiates, only 1 percent
of non-drug users and 4 percent of legal drug users do so. This
sequence is found in each of the 4 years in high school and in the
year after graduation
A 1980 study confirmed the statistical progression of marijuana
to heroin and cocaine, "The linkage between marijuana use and
later heroin or cocaine use is ten times greater than the evidence of
linkage between cigarette smoking and lung cancer” (Clayton, R.
and Voss, H. U.S. Jour, of Drug and Alcohol Dependence, Jan.
1982).

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

As the Dutch Minister of Well-being, Public Health and Culture has not
accepted the invitation to speak at this conference, I am the only Dutchman to give
you a Dutch point of view. This is a pity, at it would be very interesting to hear a
member of the Dutch government explain their drugs policy, which to many nonDutch seems perplexing. I will therefore try to explain this policy as far as I understand
it myself, but I will also criticise it. I am sure our Dutch officials are fully convinced
that their approach is the best, but I am not an admirer of this policy. You may
therefore tend to believe that I am prejudiced and that the information I give you will
be biassed. Fortunately I can quote from some articles which have appeared recently
in several Dutch papers and which show that the rosy picture of Dutch successes in
dealing with drug, which is presented by Dutch officials, is not quite in keeping with
the true facts. The most revealing is a leading article in the issue of March 7, this year,
of a magazine called Elsevier, which is the Dutch equivalent of Time Magazine. I will
mostly quote therefrom.
You may remember that for many years Holland was regarded as the
black sheep, being too tolerant in its dealing with drugs. Our government took the
point of view that only the use of hard drugs, such as heroine, LCD and cocaine, was
really dangerous and should be discouraged, but that the products of cannabis, such
as hashish and marijuana are rather harmless, and that the fight against these so-called
soft drugs has no priority. Our so-called opium-law was even changed, so that the
possession of less than 30 grams of cannabis products was no longer a crime but an
offence. The main target ofour drug policy is to separate cannabis use from the use of
other drugs. Therefore our govemement allows the establishment of so-called coffeeshops, where an official dealer is permitted to sell cannabis products, provided he does
not sell them to minors and does not sell any other hard drugs. The official philosophy
that cannabis is harmless and not even causing addiction, makes us believe that the
use of cannabis can well become integrated in our nation’s life, which means that only
excessive use is discouraged and that moderate use is no longer seen as abnormal
behaviour. Cannabis is grown today in Dutch greenhouses and seems to be one of our
most important horticulture products. Only our adherence to the Single Convention
dissuades us from legalising cannabis.
But also the fight against what the govemement calls hard drugs is waged
with a sympathetic attitudes towards users., who are not seen as criminals, except
when caught stealing. Addicts coming to the municipal health authorities are officially
registered, so that they can receive a daily dose or methadone, distributed in a socalled methadone-bus, which circulates each day around the town and stops at fixed
points. In order to prevent infection, especially AIDS, used syringes can be officially
exchanged for sterile syringe and needles. Hopeless addicts are given morphine and
psycho-social help is available for users who still have a chance to be cured. Addicts
who want to kick the habit can be admitted to a rehabilitation centre, but are free to
leave as soon as they like. Even in some prisons drugs can be obtained.
When criticised by their non-Dutch colleagues, our officials used to
answer rather apologetically that we must acknowledge the fact that drugs are being
used. But in 1987 a new policy was adopted. At a United Nations World Drugs
Conference our former Minister of Justice began to tell the world how succesfull we
were in not only stabilising but even diminishing the use of drugs. He invited experts
from other countries to come and study our policy, which soon became known as the
Amsterdam model, or rather the Dutch model, as other towns, such as Rotterdam, are
even more tolerant than our capital.

Section II. Epidemiology

261

An indeed many countries are sending their experts to Holland.
According to the Elsevier-article, just mentioned, the Amsterdam health officials are
receiving 150 groups from other countries each year and are sending doctors, social
workers and police officers to all corners of the world to tell about our successes.
The Elsevier article takes as an example the German city Frankfurt am
Main, a town with 600,000 inhabitants, where so-called "rigid" policy of dealing with
drugs had resulted in a number of 9,000 addicts and a drug-related mortality of 143 last
year. According to the health autorithies the number o f drug-addicts in Amsterdam
(
300.000 inhabitants) has dropped to between and 6 and 8,000 and the drugrelated mortality to 40 per year. Three years ago in Frankfort a red-green coalition was
installed and the alderman for health went to Amsterdam to study our policy. In
November 1990 at a conference in Frankfurt the cities of Amsterdam, Frankfurt,
Hamburg and Zürich agreed on the so-called Frankfurt Resolution, which is almost
entirely a copy of the Dutch model.
Yet the article in Elsevier’s Magazine contains also doubt about the
government’s claim of success. The head of the drugs department of the Amsterdam
health authorities is quoted as saying that the drug-related mortality figure of 40 per
year includes only the victims of overdoses and that the real figure or drug-related
deaths per year in between 100 and 150. He is also quoted as fearing that besides the 6
to 8,000 officially registered users of heroine a new group of young addicts is rapidly
increasing in numbers. He cites the example of a 22 year old prisoner he saw that
morning, who did not consider himself to be an addict, but who takes heroine first
thing in the morning and again later in the day both heroine and cocaine. This boy is
not registered, like many others. Reading this, one may question whether the real
figures of Amsterdam with its tolerant policy are so much more encouraging than the
Frankfurt figures which were the result of the former so-called rigid policy. Apparently
the Frankfurt figures were more realistic than the Amsterdam ones.
What about the separation of cannabis and the other drugs, which was the
aim of establishing coffeeshops ? This separation is no longer maintained in the city of
Rotterdam, where you will see near a side-entrance of the Central Railway Station two
containers standing side by side, called "Platform Zero", which are used as barracks
where you can get, as the Elsevier article mentions, coffee in the one and where you
can take injections and even openly buy heroine in the other without any interference
by the police. When a few weeks ago some taxidrivers got infuriated by the drug-users
and wanted to set the containers on fire, the police rushed in to protect these so that
the heroine-use could go on undisturbed. One of the churches in Rotterdam is used for
receiving drug users, a coffee bar on the ground floor and a room where heroine users
can quietly inject themselves in a cellar downstairs. In many coffeeshops you may get
the addresses where heroine and cocaine can be bought. And minors can ask adult
friends to buy the drugs they wants, which means that the restrictions to the sale of
cannabis have no effect in reality.
What about the figures given by the former Dutch Minister of Justice in
Vienna 1987? He told the conference that the use of drugs in Holland had dimished
and mentioned that of the youngsters of 19 years and less 2.5% had ever used
cannabis. But an article on November 18, 1987, in the Dutch newspaper Trouw, which
many readers consider rather liberal, gave another picture. According to the Union of
Consultation Offices for Alcohol and Drugs the use of cannabis was increasing. The
figure used by the Justice Minister was the result obtained from an inquiry amongst

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

262

families in 1983. But an enquiry made in 1985, whereby pupils were asked to fill in a
form in class, had shown a percentage of 4% , and in the age group between 15 and
24 years the percentage was 12 % nationwide and 24 u in the big cities. Apparently the
Minister had not received these later results.
What about the number of coffeeshops? In 1987 every observer could
ascertain the fact that this number was rapidly increasing, both in the big cities and in
the smaller towns, especially on the borders with Germany and Belgium. According to
police reports today there are in the whole country between 1200 and 1500
coffeeshops, whereas a few years ago there were only 800. There are now
400 coffeeshops in Amsterdam alone, causing unrest among the inhabitants, who
recently started a demonstration forcing Amsterdam’s Mayor to come and speak about
his plan to deal with this problem. In Venlo, a small town near the German border, the
35th coffeeshop was opened in February this year. If the use of drugs is really
diminishing in Holland, this almost doubling of the number of coffeeshops in a few
years time is hard to explain. Dutchmen are not known to be foolish enough to open
more shops when the market is decreasing.
Also the yearly amounts of drugs seized by police hardly support the
theory that drug use is diminishing in Holland. Whereas the amounts or heroine have
not changed very much between 1986 and 1990, the amount of cannabis seized has
doubled from 48 a 110 tons. More recent figures on drug seizures are not yet available.
On march 7 this year, the Central Criminal Investigation Department published a
statement that the drugs trade in Holland had a turnover of 2.5 billion (=thousand
million) guilders a year. A few days later an international, mainly Ghanese, gang,
which had its headquarters in Amsterdam, was arrested. It imported drugs from Asia
and South America and exported them towards the United Stated, Canada and many
countries in Europe. According to the police the gang used 1500adresses where
10.000 Ghanese were living illegally. These figures seem incredible. But together they
do not suggest that our Dutch policy is leading to decreased drug use.
The article in the newspaper Trouw also mentioned the fact that cannabisusers have problems with learning, as memory and the capacity to think logically are
impaired. On September 13, 1991, the leftist Magazine HP/de Tijd gave an extensive
article on addiction to cannabis, and a similar article appeared on January 16, 1992, in
the Magazine Panorama, which is rather wellknown for its extremely liberal views.
According to the Consultation Offices for Alcohol and Drugs the number of registered
cannabis-users, who have asked for help has increased from 567 in 1988 to 913 in 1990.
We can conclude that slowly the truth is dawning even in Holland that cannabis is not
the harmless drug it was assumed to be.
Is there a solution?
I was asked to present a Dutch point of view. I do not agree with the
tolerant policy of the Dutch government. Neither do I agree with a policy that can be
described as rigid. I know little about Sweden, but as far as I understand, the Swedes
have worked out a strategy which not only aims at reducing the availability of drugs but
also tries to help the users to stop their habit and to dissuade non-users from
experimenting with drugs.

Section II. Epidemiology

263

To dissuade non-users means providing convincing information. I know
by experience both in Morocco and in Holland, that cannabis is in itself a dangerous
drug and that its use may lead to the use of heroine and cocaine. I think that all the
governments in the world should unite on a program to inform the public, and
especially parents and educators.
To help users means providing good treatment. If I am well informed
success with the treatment of addicts depends on the duration of this treatment (as far
as I Know not less than two years) and the complete absence of drugs during the whole
period of treatment.
You may say that the number of users in the whole world is enormous and
still increasing, so that it is impossible to treat all users. And you may be right.
Whatever we do must be done on a huge scale and will ask an enormous effort. But I
think there is no other way. The danger to humanity is too great. We must attack the
problem together. And together we should be able to win the battle, if we really see the
necessity to win.

CANNABIS AND THE LAW
Georges Lagier and Je a n Michaud

ABSTRACT
In France, cannabis, its flowering tops (marihuana), its resin
(hashish) and its dérivâtes, are classified among controlled
dangerous substances.
Their use is forbidden (except for scientific research), and
should be penalized.
Accordingly, French law is in strict agreement with the 1961
International Convention on "Narcotic Drugs" ("stupéfiants"). In this
convention cannabis is listed on Schedules I and IV. French law is
also in agreement with the 1971 International Convention on
psychotropic substances, which lists tetrahydrocannabinols among
Schedule II drugs, only to be used for scientific or medical purposes.
Implementation of this law has been difficult, because of its
supplementation by a new law of December 31,
1970, which
considers an addict as a patient in need of treatment. A magistrate
may enjoin an addict to accept treatment instead of a criminal
sentence. This process is called therapeutic
injunction, or
compulsory referral of the addict into a treatment center. However,
in fact,
com pliance
with this
injunction
is
not
always
systematically carried out by the addict. For such a scheme to be
effective, a very close cooperation between the judicial system and
the addiction treatment center must exist.

THE LAW

Georges Lagier, M.D.
President National Commission on Psychoactive Drugs, Paris, France.
In France,
cannabis flowering tops (marihuana) and its resin
(hashish) are listed among substances classified as narcotics, in
French
"stu p éfian ts."
So
are
their
activ e
ingredients,
tetrahydrocannabinols, their esters, their ethers , their salts and
the salts of their dérivâtes.
The use of these substances is forbidden in France, except in
the case of exceptional derogation by the Health Department when
the drug is used for scientific research.
According to these laws, French law conforms to the 1961
International Convention on Illicit Drugs, which classifies cannabis
and its resin in Schedule I and IV.
French legislation
also conforms to the International
Convention on Psychotropic Drugs of 1971, which requires a rigorous
control on the use of tetrahydrocannabinols. Since 1991, A-9tetrahydrocannibol (A-9-THC) and its stereoisomers (2 racemic and
4 stereoisomers, including dronabinol) have been transferred from
Schedule I to Schedule II in this convention. This change of class
allows their therapeutic use in countries, like the United States and
Canada, who have approved their use for medical purposes.
Dronabinol (N° CAS 1972-08-3; (-)-trans-delta-THC; Marinol®
and Deltanyne®) is the only product for which a therapeutic use as
an anti-emetic for cancer chemotherapy has been reported.
Therefore, all the stereoisomers have been changed in class because
of complex medico-legal considerations.
The French delegation to the United Nations unsuccessfully
opposed
this change of classification for A-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
and its stereoisomers from Schedule I to Schedule II in the 1971
convention. According to the French specialists, the therapeutic
application of dronabinol was too limited and inferior to other
medications, and increased the risk of diversion of the drug to
recreational use. No medication containing A-9-THC is sold in France
or continental Europe.

H. IMPLEMENTING THE LAW
Je a n Michaud
Magistrate, Cour de Cassation, Paris, France.
The drug problem is one of the most difficult to settle
according to the French criminal laws. I want to examine the
complexity of this problem before stating the solutions given by the
law concerning the drug user.
The law of December 31, 1970 and the Public Health code,
defines the judicial process in that field. The article of the code,
L.628, punishes with imprisonment and fine the person who uses
illegal substances or plants, classified as "stupéfiants." This point
is very unusual in French law, since it raises the possibility of an
infringement of individual liberty. Some critics have claimed that
such legislation is unconstitutional. According to The Declaration of
Human Rights: Article 4: Liberty consists in doing what is not
prejudicial to others. Article 5: Law can only enforce acts that are
not prejudicial to society. But does the drug user only harm himself?
There must be serious reasons to curtail our human rights by
repressing individual freedom. In short, we may state that there is a
philosophical justification for the refusal to penalize the drug
addict.
The use of drugs leads to several social dangers: spread by
users and dealers, it incites various crimes against which society
has to protect itself. The use of drugs also leads to the alienation of
individual liberty.
Should the drug user be punished as stated in article L.628 of
the penal code? This is repression. But there is an awareness of the
special problems of the addict. The drug user appears more and more
to be a medical patient in need of treatment.
In practice, there is a very thin line between law and medicine.
Holding the violation to be more of a symptom than a crime, some
experts advocate that the culprit should be treated rather than
punished. They feel that the penalty can only worsen the problem.
There is a general tendency today, to acknowledge that treatment
should sometimes be favored over punishment.

268

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

Indeed, for the punishment to be effective, two conditions are
required: 1) the awareness of being harmful towards others, and 2)
the possibility to avoid relapsing even if it is induced by the threat
of punishment.
In that case, the only awareness is one of self-destruction
(and the claim of having a right to it). The idea of relapse does not
hold out against the overwhelming drive which takes hold of the
addict in a state of withdrawal, or when he is tempted to take his
drug of choice. Medicine and justice are attempting to act in a
complementary way.
The law delineates the different categories of illegal drugs
according to Article L .628, substances or plants classified as
"stupefiants."
We are free to consider the notion of dependency. Fighting
against dependency justifies circumventing the individual liberties
of the user. This does not solve the problem entirely. There is still a
controversy about the comparable damages of legal drugs (alcohol
and tobacco) and illegal ones.
The legislator has attempted to protect against the influence
of drugs. This action takes place before any judicial decision. The
Public Prosecutor can inform the medical authorities about an
addict's case, in order to recommend therapy or medical assistance.
This kind of prevention is very specific, and the Public Prosecutor
acts outside the prosecution system. He commits the addict to the
health services.
The judicial authorities do not interfere in two other cases:
when the addicts are reported by social services, or when they go in
for treatment on their own accord.
The public prosecutor performs its function in other cases,
when it takes the prosecution initiative.
But even in that case, compared to the traditional procedure,
there is a possibility of mitigation. If the addict agrees to
treatment, the public prosecutor candismiss the case. But
if the
addict stops treatment, or if there is a relapse, the judicial system
follows its normal course. The case is referred to the examining
magistrate and then might continue on to judgement. But again, at
those two steps, different opportunities are offered tothe accused:
the examining magistrate can order treatment for drug addiction,
continued by surveillance measures. If the process is completed, the
investigation ends without prosecution (even though an offense
occurred). If the case goes to court, two alternatives are again given
to the defendant: first, a treatment for drug addiction, followed by
an exemption from penalty if it succeeds, or second, if the

Section II. Epidemiology

treatment is refused, a probationary suspended prison sentence
depending on the acceptance of treatment.
It seems that every effort should be made to spare the addict
from criminal sentences, and to offer him the medical assistance he
needs to overcome his condition.
In the case of the drug dealer, one has to resort to criminal
law. The point is not any more to repress personal behavior without
external consequences, but to fight and punish social delinquency.
The seller of illegal drugs is harmful to others just as any other
criminal. The serious consequences of those crimes lead the
legislator to be much more severe: sentences were raised up to
twenty years. Prosecutors were released from some prosecuting
restraints by extension of preventive detention, by allowing night
searches on personal premises and by encouraging informers.
There are two opposite tendencies in French criminal law. The
first one looks for social reinsertion of the drug addict, stopping the
degradation of his condition. In that perspective, cooperation
between medicine and justice is necessary. The second is a
reinforcement of repression. It is necessary to stop the drug traffic
which is at the same time a way of protecting the drug user.
But this blend of medicine and justice, therapy and penalty, is
not always effecive. If the addict does not accept treatment, or if he
relapses, the judge will have to interfere again. This means that an
unsuccessful treatment could lead to a penalty. What is the basis for
a penalty which would have been avoided, and consequently would
not have been deserved in case the addict was cured, or on the way
to being cured?
This shows the ambiguity of the law. It can be explained by the
fact that if the law tries to protect the person, and fails, then it has
to protect society.
Have these attempts been successful in curbing drug addiction
in France? Not really, according to the available 1991 statistics
from law enforcement and treatment centers like Marmotan. Then
what should be done?
Some recommend that so-called "soft" drugs
be legalized. Others recommend reinforcement of repressive
measures. It is difficult to make new proposals in this field at a
time when permissiveness is considered better than restraint.
We can at least consider that the French law, with its medicojudicial approach, is on the right course. We have to hope that it will
be effective in the long run. Times are gone when the names of
Baudelaire and Cocteau gave drugs an artistic legitimacy. Drugs are
no more a presumed stimulant of creativity, they damage the brain.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is an intergovernmental
organization within the United Nations system. A total of 168 countries are united in
WHO, working together for the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of
health. A target towards this goal is the attainment by all people of the world, by the
Year 2000, of a level of health that will permit to lead a socially and economically
productive life, popularly known as " Health for All by the Year 2000".

W H O AND D RUG A B U SE P R O B L E M

WHO has recognized that health problems related to dnig abuse are of
major public and political concern in a large number of countries. It is estimated that
there is a total of 48 million drug abusers in the world, including some 30 million
cannabis users1. Although a dramatic escalation in the abuse of cocaine and heroine
has occurred during the last decade, cannabis still continues to be the most widely
abused drug.
WHO’s Programme on Substance Abuse (PSA) was established and its
Strategy Document2 published in 1990. This new programme emphasizes the crucial
importance of demand reduction as part of a balanced approach to combat the drug
problem. WHO works in close collaboration with governments, non-governmental
organizations and all relevant UN agencies such as the United Nations International
Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) and the International Narcotics Control Board
5INCB), both located in Vienna, Austria.

E X T E N T O F CAN N ABIS P R O B L E M

According to the UN statistics, and despite increased expenditure on law
enforcement, the production, traffic and abuse of cannabis continue to be
widespread3'5.
The quantity of both herb and plants reported by weight increased in
1986-1987 but declined very sharply in 1989. However, the annual seizures of cannabis
resin (around 400 tons) have remained almost unchanged during 1989-1990.
According to the INCB5 cannabis is mainly produced in som African
countries such as Morocco, Sudan, Nigeria, Ghana, Rwanda, Zaire and Zambia.
Other important production areas are situated in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bekaja Valley
in Lebanon, Nepal, Mexico, Colombia, Jamaica and Belize. Also in the former USSR
drug-related problems continue to develop in increasing proportions. The drugs
frequently abused are mostly of local origin., namely opium ana cannabis. Cannabis
grows wild on approximately 4 million hectares in Kazakhstan, on 1.5 million hectares
in the far-eastern provinces as well as on vast lands of the lower Volga river basin, in
nothem Caucasus and in southern regions of the Ukraine. While many illicit poppy

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology , Detection

fields are destroyed by law enforcement squads, efforts to eliminate growth of wild
cannabis have little success.
In recent years, increasing cultivation of cannabis has been found in the
USA and the authorities have taken measures in order to control this important source
of domestic consumption, including identification of the distributors of the
equipments used by illicit growers.
Data from some Western European countries and the United States seem
to indicate that the number of abusers of cannabis is levelling off and in some instances
declining5. Meanwhile, cannabis abuse is beginning to spread to several Central and
Eastern European countries. There are signs of rapid development of organized traffic
in cannabis in Czechoslovakia and the former USSR. According to the INCB, in
December 1990, some 1.8 tons of cannabis resin seized in Germany were reported to
have been transported overland via USSR from Afghanistan5.

H A R M FU L E F F E C T S O F CAN N ABIS A B U SE

A number of speakers in this meeting have emphasized the harmful
consequences of cannabis abuse. In order to avoid repetition, I would only like to
summarize the point of view of WHO as follows:
- Based on discussions in WHO Scientific Groups, existing International
treaties on drug abuse control and resolutions of the UN Economic
and Social Council, the World Health Organization considers that
cannabis has both acute and chronic harmful effects on human
health.
- WHO recommends that all governments should intensify their efforts
to reduce the demand for cannabis and cannabis resin and limit the
licit use of cannabis products to medical and scientific research only.
- WHO further recommends that scientific research, especially long­
term investigations on the effect of cannabis abuse in human
organism, should be continued.
- Furthermore, WHO urges all governments to maintain or adopt
appropriate preventive measures towards the harmful health and
other consequences of cannabis use.
LEG A LISA T IO N N O T AN O PT IO N

Based on the UN Conventions6"7 and supporting the view of the INCB4"5
and the Council of Europe, WHO does not support the view which continues to be
voiced advocating the legalisation of the possession and use of some or all drugs for
non-medical puiposes. Such an approach might be interpreted by potential abusers as
sanctioning ana approving drug use. This can be expected to interfere with
programmes to reduce the demand for drugs and to promote life free from drug abuse.
Prohibition of the non-medical possession and use of narcotic drugs and
psychotropic substances represent specific obligations of the Parties under the
UN single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961), the 1971 Convention on
Psychotropic Substances and the 1988 UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.

DETECTION, IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF
CANNABINOIDS AND THEIR METABOLITES IN BIOLOGICAL
FLUIDS
Pierre Levillain
Hopital Fernand Widal - Laboratoire de Toxicologie

ABSTRACT
Identification of
cannabis use requires a screening test,
(immunoassay) for 11
THC carboxylic acid in urine. If the
concentration is higher than the cut off value, a confirmation test
must be used, gas chromatography/mass spectrom etry. The
conjunction of a positive immunoassay, a proper chromatographic
retention time and at leastthree mass ions with appropriate
intensities constitutes definitive proof of the presence of 11 THC
carboxylic acid in urine and of cannabis use. Quantitative analysis of
cannabinoids and their metabolites in blood plasma may be required
in case of intoxication or for determining time of ingestion.
Methods used for drug identification can produce erroneous results.
Endogenous substances andother drugs can interfere in
the
determination, giving cross reactions with immunoassay reagents or
identical retention times in chromatographic procedures. They can
also increase the detection limits of the various methods.
Cannabinoids and their metabolites must be extracted and separated
from the biological background before analysis, and during these
steps loss of material can occur. Such errors can produce false
positive or negative results. Because the use of cannabis is illegal,
the consequence of a positive test is important. Its identification
must be reliable and interpretation of the urine testing result must
be clear. For this purpose, the analyst must have a good knowledge of
all the methods used in terms of specificity, sensitivity, accuracy
and precision. He must define the limit of detection and be sure that
this limit is below the cut off value for the drug. The results must
be supported by intralaboratory control data and by external
proficiency testing. Standard quality controls practiced in clinical
laboratories must be applied to analyses for drugs of abuse.

INTRODUCTION
The low levels of cannabinoids in body fluids make their
detection and quantification difficult: A-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
blood concentration never exceeds a few hundred ng per ml in man.
Furthermore, the rapid diffusion and metabolization of these
compounds results in a fast decrease of their plasma concentration.
In addition, a large number of metabolites have been isolated and
complicates laboratory analysis. A rapid survey of pharmacokinetics
and metabolism of cannabinoids is helpful in addressing problems
raised by their detection and analysis. Use of cannabis is forbidden
by law and raises the possibility of legal action against users.
Consequently, results of drug testing must be as error free as
possible. This requires an answer to three questions. What
metabolite must be detected? In what fluid? What methods must be
used?
I - PHARMACOKINETICS AND METABOLISM
Cannabinoids in plasma
Among the numerous terpenic compounds of cannabis, three are
currently found in smokers blood: cannabidiol, cannabinol and
A-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The maximum concentration of THC
(the most active compound) is reached 10 to 20 minutes after the
beginning of inhalation and is currently about 100 ng/ml. This level
is influenced by the way of smoking (puff duration, retention of
smoke in lungs, etc.) as well as individual sensitivity. But the
lipophily of THC allows it to diffuse easily in various organs,
especially the brain, where it is responsible for the characteristic
euphoria, heart, with an increase in cardiac rhythm, liver, where it
is metabolized, and lipids, where it can be accumulated. This fast
diffusion step involves a deep fall in blood concentration; the
amount of THC is only about 10 ng/ml after one hour and around 1
ng/ml after 6 hours. At last THC is slowly eliminated from organs
over several days, which results in blood plasma concentrations
ranging from 1 to 0.1 ng/ml. Cannabinol and cannabidiol possesses a
pharmacokinetic behaviour similar to THC. Because of their low
polarity, cannabinoids are slightly soluble in water, so that in blood
plasma they are mainly adsorbed on lipoproteins, which makes their
recovery from this fluid more difficult. Garret and Hunt found that
the detection sensitivity for THC in dog plasma could decrease 10
fold after eating.

Section III. Detection, Identification and Testing

The main advantage of drug testing on blood lies in that the
specimen is taken by health professionals, which eliminates sample
falsification. But the small amount of specimen, the low level of
drug and its fast elimination, as well as the difficulty in separating
THC from endogenous lipids makes it difficult to use this fluid for a
large screening of cannabis users. Clean up methods, necessary to
obtain partial purification of THC from lipids largely increases the
complexity of the laboratory work.
Metabolism
The liver plays an important part in THC detoxification and
elimination. Cytochrome P450 is involved in hydroxylation which
occurs quickly in C n (11 hydroxy THC can be detected in blood 10
minutes after an I.V. injection of THC) but also, more slowly, in Cs
or in different carbon atoms of the pentyl side chain. Further
oxidation can result in the formation of a carboxylic group in C n or
in the side chain, or of a ketone in Cs* Some of the acids are found in
free form, but most are conjugated as glucuronide ester. Eighty
different metabolites of THC have been isolated. All of them are
more soluble in water than the parent molecule, which allows them
to be eliminated in gall (70%) or urine.
The major metabolite is 11 THC carboxylic acid. It is quickly
eliminated in urine as a result of metabolization. But the molecule
can be found for several days at low levels in urine, because of the
retention of THC in different tissues: duration of excretion can
largely vary (from three days for casual smokers to thirty days for
heavy marijuana users).
Urine appears to be the best fluid for identification of
cannabis users; the long period of excretion of 11 THC carboxylic
acid makes its detection easy. In addition, there is less interaction
between cannabinoids and urine components than in blood, so
extraction is easier. And lastly, large volumes can be readily
collected noninvasively.
Many drugs or metabolites can be found in saliva, which has
been proposed for detection of THC. But there are some
disadvantages in using this fluid: difficulty in obtaining the
specimen, and small sample size causes difficulties of confirmation
and quantification.

II - ANALYTICAL METHODS
Generally, testing urine for drugs of abuse includes a screening
test, used to rapidly, easily and inexpensively separate the positive
specimens from those that produce negative results. But because
these screening tests are subject to interferences, those specimens
that yield a positive screening require an additional confirmation
procedure, which may be slower and more expensive, but must
provide a more specific result. In some cases, cannabinoids and their
metabolites can be quantified.
Screening procedure
Thin Layer chromatography largely is a matter of controversy.
It may be a relatively inexpensive method for screening because
multiple specimens can be applied to one thin layer plate, but most
authors consider this technique to be obsolete and inadequate for
drug screening mainly because of its lack of sensitivity and
selectivity. Curiously, new papers regularly appear in scientific
reviews about this technique. Indeed, sensitivity can be increased by
extracting cannabinoids and their metabolites from large samples of
urine and concentrating the extract into a small volume before
chromatography. But it needs to hydrolyze glucuronides of carboxylic
acids before extraction, which makes analyses more complex.
Also,
staining the plates with Fast Blue B increases the color intensity of
cannabinoid spots. Detection limit as low a 2 ng/ml have been
determined, which favorably compares with immunoassays. Lack of
selectivity results from the nonreproducibility of Rf and from
substances that interfere with the detection. But separation of
interfering compounds and reproducibility of Rf can be largely
improved by usingover pressured layers for migration. Differences
in the methods used can explain the varying results of blind
comparison studies between thin layer chromatograpy and other
methods. In conclusion, thin layer chromatography can provide good
results only at the expense of simplicity of use; the manipulations
must be rigorously standardized and only executed by well trained
technicians. Thin layer chromatography is also used for cleaning up
samples for more sensitive techniques such as mass spectrometry
or RIA.
Immunoassay is by far the most commonly used technique for
screening 11 THC carboxylic acid in urine. Advantages of this method
are well known: it needs only small samples, allows direct detection
without preliminary treatment of sample and its sensitivity is high

Section III. Detection, Identification and Testing

(ng amounts of drugs can be detected). Furthermore, the reaction can
easily be automated, which increases precision and speed of
analysis. But immunoassay suffers from the lack of specificity of
antibodies, as different molecules (mainly other cannabinoids) can
react with them. This possibility of cross reactions requires that
positive results be confirmed by more specific methods.
Several
means are used to detect the immunochemical
reaction. The
most popular is the Emit or enzyme multiplied
immunoassay technique, which offers two advantages. It is a
homogenous assay, avoiding separation steps, and the final detection
is based on spectrophotometric measurement, which makes it easy
to adapt this technique to classical automates used in biochemical
lab oratories.
The Emit screening test compares the absorbance obtained for
each specimen with the value measured for a calibrator. This
standard contains a specified concentration of 11 THC carboxylic
acid that is considered as the limit for positive results (cut off
value). The comparison allows us to determine whether the specimen
level is lower or higher than the limit. Evaluation of the Emit test
(with a cut off value of 100 ng/ml) with radioimmunoassay and gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry has shown a 4% rate of false
positive and a 10% rate of false negative. Anything that modifies
enzyme activity (for ex temperature change or presence of enzyme
inhibitor) canproduce erroneous
results. Also, false positive tests
have been obtained with urines containing high concentrations of
antiinflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, nafroxen and fenoprofen),
ethacrynic acid, promethazine and riboflavine. These false reactions
have been eliminated by use of monoclonal antibodies. On the
contrary, melanin and indole compounds do not interfere. In the same
way, endogenous malate deshydrogenase can perturb a test when this
enzyme is used for labeling 11 THC carboxylic acid, so that glucose
6 phosphate deshydrogenase nowadays is currently used as a marker.
Different procedures have been successfully applied for the
analysis of cannabinoids in blood by the Emit method. They involve
protein precipitation and drug extraction by an organic solvent,
evaporation of the solvent to dryness and dissolution of residue in
buffer before analysis by immunoassay.
The cannabinoid radioimmunoassay
Abuscreen
is also
frequently used for urine screening. The
marker is a
radiolabelled cannabinoid which needs a counter for detection. The
method involves several steps, including physical separation before
radioactivity measurement, which is less favorable for high volume

283

284

tests. Comparison of positive and negative results with GC-MS are
good, but metabolites quantitations are rather different since RIA
detect several metabolites while GC-MS detect only one.
Flu orescen ce
polarization
assay
is
also
com m ercially
available, but needs a specific apparatus for detection, which limits
application of the method.
For all immunoassays, choice of the cut off value is important.
If it is too low, many positive responses can be found when the
metabolite is not present or at a concentration below the limit
value. Furthermore, passive inhalation of marijuana smoke can be
detected. But, if it is too high, some positive specimen will be found
negative. The U.S. National Institute for Drug Abuse recommends a
cut off value of 100 ng/ml.
Adulterants (salts, liquid soap, detergents, lemon juice,
household cleaners, etc.) can easily produce false positive or
negative results when used at relatively low levels. This must be
kept in mind during urine sampling as drug users can easily
adulterate specimens.
Confirmation and quantification
of cannabinoids and their
m etab olites
Confirmation of positive screening test and quantification of
cannabinoids and their metabolites are best performed by physical
methods which are more specific than the previous one.
They generally involve a pretreatment of biological fluids. In
urines, glucuronide esters of THC metabolites are hydrolyzed by
enzymic reaction or in basic media to obtain free carboxylic acids.
After urine adjustment to low pH (3 to 5), the metabolites are
extracted by organic solvents or adsorbed on a solid phase, washed
to eliminate interfering substances and eluted by an organic solvent
which is next evaporated. After dissolution in the proper solvent,
the residue is ready for analysis. In blood plasma, the cannabinoids
are first separated from lipoprotein by an organic solvent (methanol,
acetone...) in neutral or acidic medium.
Excellent separation can be obtained for cannabinoids and their
metabolites by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Reversed phase columns are nowadays the most often used for this
purpose, either in urine or in blood and saliva. The main problem is
detection. Owing to the small molecular absorptivity of these
compounds, U.V. detection lacks sensitivity. Furthermore, detection
occurs at wavelengths (mainly 210 to 225 nm) where interference

Section III. Detection, Identification and Testing

from biological compounds can occur. The detection limit can be
largely improved with suitable derivatization: post column reaction
with Fast Blue B allows the detection of cannabinoids at 490 nm. A

of cannabinoids. Transform ation
of these
molecules to highly fluorescent compounds by U.V. irradiation is also
possible. But the necessary reaction steps make the analysis more
complex.
Importance of electrochemical detection for cannabinoids
regularly increases in HPLC. Their phenolic group is easily oxidized
at a carbon electrode, either in the amperometric or coulometric
mode, which increases sensitivity for THC or THC carboxylic acid,
both in blood and urine.
Results of HPLC separation can be quantified by comparison
with standard curves or better, with an internal standard. But
identification is based on the retention time of the substance, which
cannot be considered as an absolute proof of identity. That is why
HPLC has found application in cleaning up extracts or separating
metabolites before mass spectrometry.
The most widely used analysis method for cannabinoids is
based on gas chromatography. Most applications are concerned with
identification of 11 THC carboxylic acid in urine, but a few are
related to the determination of cannabinoids in blood and saliva.
Good separation can be achieved with the free neutral cannabinoids
(THC, cannabinol...), but better results are obtained after
d erivatization.
D erivatization
is
unavoidable
with
acid ic
cannabinoids (mainly 11 THC carboxylic acid) as the free compounds
are less volatile and decarboxylate by heating. Methyl or
trimethylsilyl derivatives are currently used, but labelling with
fluorinated compounds (pentafluorobenzoate, pentafluoropropanoate,
bromopentafluorotoluene, etc.) allows a more sensitive detection
with electron capture based methods.
Conventional packed columns afford good separations, but
capillary columns are finding increasing applications. The stationary
phases most commonly used for coating these columns have low or
medium polarity (OV 1 or OV 17 for instance).
In gas chromatography, detection is easier than in HPLC. Good
sensitivity is obtained by using flame ionization methods (detection
limit around 10 ng/ml) but sensitivity is largely increased with
electron capture detectors (detection limit below 1 ng/ml), which
are currently used. Fourier transform infrared spectrometers can
now be interfaced with gas chromatographs, which allows

285

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

286

identification of cannabinoids in cannabis extracts, but this method
has not yet been used in biological fluids.
Combination of gas chromatography with mass spectrometry
provides the best level of confidence for identification of
cannabinoids and their metabolites. It is also highly sensitive, so it
allows the detection of quantities in the pg range, although
sensitivity is largely lower in biological media because of
perturbations
induced
by
endogenous
products.
Although
instrumentation design and cost have been improved recently, the
main drawbacks are the expense of the equipment and the necessary
clean up steps of samples before injection.
Several ionization methods (chemical ionization, electron
impact with different energies...) can be used, that results in a
variable number of mass ions. Detection can be operated in different
ways which produces spectral data of different types. In the
selected ion mode only a few selected ion mass, corresponding to
fragments of the drug to be determined are measured, which
increases sensitivity but involves a loss of selectivity. The full scan
mode, on the contrary, provides a record of the complete mass
spectrum, but with a loss in sensitivity. Identification as well as
quantification are best performed by comparison with an internal
standard such as a stable isotope of the cannabinoids or of their
metabolites. The usual standards are deuterolabelled cannabinoids,
but also A8 isomers, not found in natural samples.

ABSTRACT
The metabolic pathways of delta-9-THC, cocaine and opiates
are summarized, and their main urinary metabolites described. For
delta-9-THC: 11 nordelta-9-THC carboxylic acid. For cocaine:
benzoylecgonine and m ethylester of ecgonine. For opiates:
monoacetylmorphine (heroin), morphine, codeine. All opiates have
the same urinary catabolites: morphine and codeine. The latter
compound is a therapeutic agent. Detection of urinary cannabinoid
metabolites (exceeding 20 ng/ml) as a result of passive exposure to
cannabis smoke have been reached experimentally under conditions
which rarely prevail in real life situations. Opiate and cocaine
urinary metabolites may be detected 4 to 5 days after cessation of
their consumption. Cannabinoid urinary metabolites may be detected
3 to 5 days after occasional smoking, and up to 77 days after chronic
use (5 cigarettes a day).

Prior to the analysis of analytical results it is necessary to give a short
review of the metabolism of the main illegal drugs.
I. REVIEW OF METABOLIC PROCESSES
A. CANNABINOID DERIVATIVES
Approximately one hundred molecules can be isolated from extracts
of Cannabis sativa. The main psychoactive structure is delta 9tetrahydrocannabinol or A 9-TH C.
Preparations offered to consumers contain highly variable amounts
of active principle (1 to 40%) depending on the origin of the plant, on
the quantity of added products and on their form : leaves, flower tips,
haschisch, resin,
The metabolism of A9-THC is relatively simple. It is summarized in
table 1.
The active principle is mostly transformed in the liver :
-oxidation of the methyl group, in position 9, into primary
alcohol function
-oxidation of the alcohol function into carboxylic acid
-conjugation of the acid function by glucoronic acid
-urinary excretion of the conjugated derivative
B. COCAINE
Of the many chemical structures isolated from leaves of
Erythroxylon coca, the most important one is an alcaloid : cocaine.
It is sold on the market in various forms, from white powder to
mixtures containing various percentages of added products.
Cocaine can be administered in different ways :
-sniffed
-injected (shoot)
-ingested (chewed by Incas)
-inhaled as smoke : more recently, with the advent of crack.
Although more complex than that of A 9-THC the metabolism of
cocaine is relatively simple as shown in table II. The active principle is
mostly transformed in the liver and in the plasma. Under the action of
esterases two products are formed : (table 2).
-benzoylecgonine (35 to 54%)
-methylester of ecgonine (30 to 50%)

Aside from these two major metabolic pathways two substances can
be found :
-ecgonine (1 to 10%)
-nor-cocaine. The presence of a N-demethyled derivate of cocaine
is the sign of an acute intoxication by this alcaloid.

C. MORPfflN DERIVATIVES
Many alcaloids are derived from Papaver somniferum but only two
of them can induce drug abuse :
-morphine (5 to 20% ), main compound
-codeine or methylmorphine (0.5 to 1.5%)
Two neighboring structures should be associated with these natural
m o le cu les :

and
p h olcod in e
(morpholinethylmorphine) also used as anti-cough molecules.
When not used for therapeutic purposes heroin is a semi synthetic
substance obtained by simple acetylation of the alcohol and phenol
functions of morphine. It is considered as one of the hardest drugs
because it becomes addictive after it has been used for some time.
Drug addicts most often use it intravenously ("shoot") but it can also
be smoked or sniffed.
The major metabolic pathways are summarized in Table 3. They
show :
- a significant glucoconjugation of the alcohol and phenol functions
(approx. 70% ),
- a N-demethylation (approx. 20% ) with the production of nor
dérivâtes (nor-morphine, nor-codeine...),
- a dealkylation (loss of ethyl and methyl radicals) inducing the
endogenous formation of morphine in the case of codethyline,and
even more so of codeine, which complicates the interpretation of
analytical results obtained on biological samples.
It seems of interest to mention that bioactivation of codeine in
human hepatocytes is obtained through the action of polymorphous
mono-oxygenase, better known as cytochromous dbl/bufl, which also
catalyzes the hydroxylation of debrisoquine.
The O-déméthylation of codeine into morphine shows that there are
very active metabolizers (which create problems in the interpretation
of results) and subjects with a deficit in polymorphous mono­
oxygenase, whose urine never shows any morphine.

* carboxylic 11 Nor A 9-THC acid, unquestionably reveals the
presence of cannabinoid derivatives, evidence of the consumption
o f preparations containing Cannabis sativa.
* ecgonine, methylesterecgonine and/or benzoyl-ecgonine, show
that preparations containing extracts of Erythroxylon coca were
used.

B. MORPHINE DERIVATIVES
The situation is very different for morphine as the presence of this
molecule, even when it is perfectly identifiable, is no univocal proof of
drug addiction. As it has previously been mentioned, urinary
morphine can have several origins :
* morphine itself
* heroin, after reaction of désacétylation
* codeine and/or codethyline after loss of methyl and/or ethyl
radicals.
Even when morphine has been unquestionably identified in urine it
therefore seems possible to encounter problems of interpretation. The
reason for this situation is that a number of compounds have the same
urinary catabolite, morphine. This must constantly be remembered by
all those who may be involved in fitness examinations or who may
impose sanctions.
Table 4 summarizes all the various possible cases
that must be considered.

C. PASSIVE SMOKERS
Aside from problems relative to morphine derivatives, we should
also discuss the problem of passive smokers in the case of Cannabis.
Table 5 describes the experimental conditions implemented by CONE
and JOHNSON to show that cannabinoid derivatives can be present in
urines of subjects who passively inhaled smoke. These results are at
the origin of a heated debate still unsettled. However,
results we
obtained on several thousand assays call for certain restrictions to the
conclusions of these authors. The volume of the room where the
experiment took place was only 1 2 .5 cubic metres, which, for a
distance to the ceiling of 2 .4 0 meters, amounts to a groung surface of
5 .2 0 square meters. Placing five individuals in this room and making
them breathe one hour a day for six days at least the equivalent of
four cigarettes of haschisch containing 27 mg A 9-THC (very high
quality cigarettes) with no ventilation seems rather unrealistic. The
authors have the honesty to report that subjects had to wear goggles
to minimize eye irritation from the smoke. And even under these
conditions only 4.6% of all urine samples showed a positive reaction
at the 20 ng.ml-1 threshold after passive inhalation of four cigarettes,,
and none showed a positive reaction at the 7 5 ng.ml-1 threshold. This
means that under the most common conditions of use (party, piano
bar, night- club...), the threshold of 20 ng.ml-1, which is the smallest
available in immunology, is sufficiently high to preclude any
confusion with the tricky and irritating problem of passive smokers.
D. POSITIVE TEST READING TIME
Positive reading times for urine tested for illegal drugs are shown
in Figure 2. They indicate that a subject can be proved to have been a
Cannabis smoker more than two months after he (she) has stopped
using it.

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

INTRODUCTION
C an n abis in tox ica tion is m ain ly due to TH C , one o f the m any
pharmacologically active cannabinoids absorbed after smoking or ingestion
(Harvey 1987). Partly because of its extreme lipid solubility, blood THC levels
correlate only modestly with cannabis intoxication (Ohlsson et aL 1980; McBay
1988). Urinary levels of THC metabolites are present for weeks or months after
exposu re, and thus offer an even w eaker index o f current in take or
intoxication. Recently, the detection of THC in saliva has been demonstrated to
offer a sim ple, non-invasive index o f current exposure (Gross et al. 1985;
Thom pson and Cone 1987). This study reports the correlation betw een
subjective intoxication, heart rate, and salivary THC.

M A TERIA LS AND M ETHODS
Thirteen paid volunteers were used. All were male, ranging in age from 22
to 36 (mean 25.5 years) with average height = 184 cm and average weight = 84
kg. A ll were experienced cannabis sm okers, using the drug 2-12 tim es per
month, and had no other substance use other than moderate alcohol intake.
One w eek's abstinence from cannabis was required prior to the study. A ll
subjects were screened and judged fît on the basis of physical examination,
brief psychiatric interview, ECG and routine laboratory studies (haematology
screen, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests). Urine screening confirmed
the presence of THC metabolites in all but one subject
Subjects individually smoked one cannabis cigarette (500 mg) containing 11
± 1 m g THC. Subjective intoxication was measured at baseline and at various
intervals after smoking by asking participants to place a m ark on a 80 mm
linear visual analogue scale between "com pletely straigh t' and "the m ost
stoned I have ever been (on cannabis alone)." McBay (1988) and others have
indicated that subjective intoxication is well correlated with other behavioural
measures, such as cognitive task impairment. Supine heart rate was estimate
from the radial pulse over 30 s.
Pilot studies showed that expectorated saliva stimulated with chewing gum
(1 min, Wrigley"s Juicy Fruit) was substantially easier to collect and analyze
reproducibly than either unstimulated saliva or that collected with a dental
cotton roll or cotton bud-on-a-stick. Samples, collected in silanised screw-cap
vials (8 ml) containing sodium fluoride (40 mg) as a preservative, were stored
in the dark at 4° C until analysis. Food and drink w ere allow ed, but
monitoring showed these to have little effect on THC time curves.
Salivary THC was m easured using a m odification o f the G C-m ass
spectrometrie technique of M cBumey et aL (1986). An internal standard (12 ng
of the heptyl analogue of delta-8-THC in 5 |il ethanol) was added to 200 pi 8 M
urea in silanised glass tubes. Samples o f 20-200 pi saliva were added, vortexed
and then extracted with 4 ml pentane by rotating for 30 min on a turntable.
After centrifugation, pentane was recovered under nitrogen at 50° C. Extracts

Section III. Detection, Identification and Testing

301

were then derivatised by adding 50 pi hexane and 30 jjI pentafluoropropionic
anhydride (Pierce) and incubating at 60° C for 15 m in. A fter evaporation
again under nitrogen at 50° C, residues were dissolved in 40 jil heptane and 4
|jl volumes were injected into the GLC. A Hewlett-Packard GLC (5890) with
autoirgector (7673) and mass selective detector (5970), operating in a single-ion
m onitoring mode, were used w ith HP-UX software. Further details o f this
technique, including comparisons with HPLC, TDx immunoassays, and RIA,
are available from one of the authors (E.C.).
Statistical treatment of data included logarithmic transformation o f [THC]
and subsequent param etric (Pearson product-m om ent) correlation with
intoxication ratings and heart rate. In addition to such correlations for each
individual, these were combined into pooled estimates for all subjects. Because
inflated type 1 error is com monly overlooked in such repeated m easures
designs, a M ANOVA procedure (SPSS-X) was used to provide an unbiased
estim ate o f the overall correlation across tim e o f log [THC], subjective
intoxication, and increase in heart rate (O'Brien and Kaiser 1985).
RESULTS
Baseline testing showed five or seven subjects had detectable salivary THC,
ranging from trace (< 0.2) to 3.4 ng/ml (mean 0.36 ng/ml). Cannabis smoking
produced marked increases in salivary THC, subjective intoxication and heart
rate (Fig. 1). W ith one exception, these three measures all peaked at 20 min
and decayed monotonically thereafter. There was no relationship between
baseline measures o f [THC], intoxication (mean 2.8 out o f 80.0, range 0-7) or
heart rate and subsequent effects of cannabis smoking. All subjects reported
their "h ig h " was generally sim ilar to their usual social experiences o f
cannabis smoking.

TESTING FOR ILLICIT DRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE
Peter B. Bensinger 1
Former Director, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, D.C.

ABSTRACT
Testing for illicit drugs through urinalysis has had a dramatic
impact in the United States in reducing illegal drug use on and off
the job for employees and for individuals in professional and
amateur sports and in military occupations. Drug testing has been
increasingly utilized effectively to stem the widespread availability
of illegal drugs and the significant threat to safety, performance
and health. Illegal drugs can be most effectively identified by
urinalysis, although other testing methods under consideration
include blood, saliva, eye movement and hair. Drug testing by
urinalysis has been conducted accurately and legally in the United
States for the armed forces, employees in industry (both union and
nonunion), government agencies and in sports. The process utilized
has generally been to take a preliminary screen from a urine
specimen, either by enzyme immunoassay, fluorescent polarization
or radio immunoassay technology, and if the specimen is positive, to
confirm with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Blood testing,
while also accurate for -illicit drugs, has been viewed as more
invasive, painful and expensive. In addition, some drugs of concern,
such as marijuana, are not identifiable in the blood after one day,
while detectable in urine over a week or more depending on usage
ra te .

INTRODUCTION
Drug testing is a powerful deterrent to illegal drug use if
sanctions apply to individuals found to be positive. This has been
true in the military and for private and public employees, and for
professional athletes. Drug testing is also a valuable treatment tool
and is considered essential for recovering substance abusers
returning to work and attempting to stay drug free.
METHODS
The testing process using urinalysis on the preliminary test
can provide almost immediate reporting depending on the type of
test methodology used. A written printout of the results can be made
available. Illegal drugs that are normally screened include
marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, barbiturates, PCP, opiates,
benzodiazepines and methaqualone. A number of individuals and
organizations have challenged the use of drug testing as an invasion
of privacy and as scientifically inaccurate. The United States
Supreme Court has found urinalysis drug testing to be legal and
accurate, even on a random basis, for individuals tested in safetysensitive jobs in transportation and law enforcement occupations.
The court reviewed the purpose of the testing, scientific accuracy of
the methodology, invasiveness of the specimen collection procedures
and the consequences of the actions taken on positive results. Hair
testing and saliva testing have not been used on a widespread basis
in the United States, nor has blood testing for illicit drugs, although
blood and breathalyzer testing have been increasingly utilized for
the identification of alcohol.
The urinalysis drug test results can report quantitatively and
qualitatively. Established cut-off levels are selected for each drug
above which any test will be reported as positive. Urinalysis testing
costs depend on the volume and the methodology utilized. Employers
also may require physicians to review drug test reports to assure
that legal prescriptions are appropriately identified and confirmed
with the individual doctor.
RESULTS
The use of drug testing in the military was the principal factor
driving down illegal drug use by young sailors in the navy, over 40
percent of whom tested positive in 1981, as compared to less than 4
percent testing positive today. In private industry, the use of pre­

Section III. Detection, Identification and Testing

employment, post-accident and post-treatment drug testing has
resulted in dramatic decreases in the number of individuals testing
positive and using illegal drugs on and off the job. In the United
States, over 85 percent of the largest employers utilize urinalysis
drug testing as a means of preventing illegal drug use on and off
thejob. The options for drug testing must include questions such as
when such tests are performed, what methodology is used, what
drugs are included in the test panel, what cut-off levels are
selected, where the specimen collection takes place, what
laboratory does the testing and what action is taken with the
results. The effectiveness of drug testing depends on a well thought
out, carefully explained process, regardless of where or how it is
used.
Several studies have been conducted that examine work
performance of employees using illegal drugs compared with those
who have tested negative for such drugs. At the U.S. Postal Service,
accident rates, injury, absenteeism and disciplinary problems were
found to be far higher for illegal drug users. The U.S. Postal Service,
the biggest employer in the United States with 900,000 employees,
wanted to examine by means of a drug test whether people who may
have used drugs would have a major negative impact in the work
place. So they did a test for 4000 workers applying for jobs, since
they were taking urine samples anyway. 8.5% tested positive,
slightly over 300. And then they went to work for the Postal Service.
The Postal Service wanted to know what happened to those who had
tested positive for using illegal drugs, when compared to those who
had not used illegal drugs. After 8 months, those who had tested
positive for drugs, were absent (43%) more often that those who
tested negative (32% ). Those who had tested positive (and their
supervisors did not know it) had termination (because of rule
violations, problems on the job) and a turnover rate higher than
those who tested negative. After 16 months their termination rate
rose to 59%, absenteeism to 60% and the turnover rate to 50%. The
Postal Service decided to do pre-employment drug testing to save 62
million dollars a year, and decrease absenteeism, turnover and
accidents.

Negative impact of drugs in the workplace
(Postal Service)

The postal Service now requires everyone to pass a preemployment drug test before being hired, as do nine out of ten of the
other largest employers in the United States. Major companies and
government agencies use random drug tests for current employees
involved in particularly safety-sensitive jobs in the airline,
railroad, nuclear power, oil and gas pipeline, maritime, mass
transportation and trucking industries, as well as in law
enforcement agencies.

COMPANY RESPONSIBILITIES
-

Safe work environment
Clear policy rules
Conformity with the law
Protection of key company assetspeople as well as property
- Requirement to intervene when safety is compromised

Employers in the United States are saying: "We need a safe
work environment, clear rules, conformity with the law, protection
of our key asset - that is people, not the equipment." It is the people
that make the company - and the requirement to intervene when
their safety is compromised. Those are the responsibilities of an

employer. A policy in which drugs are available or tolerated
conflicts with safety, conformity with the law and protection of
people.

DRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE - KEY ISSUES
- Clear company policy
- Fitness for duty - condition of employment
- Education and awareness
- Management support
- Labor/Union participation/education
- Drug testing
- Employee assistance
- Supervisory training

In Europe you say: "Well, that is the U.S. experience, here it is
different." But let me just say that the jobs are the same: Driving a
truck, working in a warehouse, on a fork lift truck, on a construction
job, on a railroad, on a bus, in a watch factory. While the language
may be German, French, Italian or English, the type of work is the
same, and requires reasoning, judgement, coordination and memory.
And the drugs are the same: marihuana, hashish, cocaine,
amphetamines, heroin. The impact on health, on safety and
performance is the same. One of the compelling factors in the United
States which has decreased drug use, has been the crusade of the
parents movement. It has not been people like me, making speeches.
It has not been solely the arrests by the police. It has been the
parents and their children, acknowledging the truth of health
information as they saw their friends dropping out of society. And
finally, the knowledge that people looking for employment will not
be able to get any jobs if they use drugs.

DRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE EUROPE- USA
- Same type job assignments
factory
assembly line
construction worker
heavy machinery operator
- Same drugs
hashish
cocaine
amphetamines
- Same impact on performance

Some of the work place issues are: fitness for duty as a
condition of employment, union and management working together,
employee-assistance, drug-testing and education.
THE LIABILITY OF DOING NOTHING
- Safety of the work environment
- Security of plant equipment, company property and assets
- Health problems of employees

Safety of the work environment, security of plant and equipment and
health of the employees are jeopardized if one does not stem the
tide of drug abuse in the workplace. It is a major issue facing
W estern
industrialized
nations.
It requires
opposing
drug
legalization.
EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

Voluntary referral
Management referral
Management consult
Treatment follow-up

Programs that can help employees who have problems are
essential, and have been neglected. The earlier one intervenes, the
better the opportunity for individual rehabilitation.
CONCLUSION
Drug testing is no magic wand, nor a panacea, but urinalysis
testing for drugs has been found to be a valuable preventive,
informational and rehabilitative tool. I believe it will be
increasingly used around the world to fight the spread of illegal drug
use, and the damage such use can cause, not only to the user but to
society as a whole.

SCREENING STUDENTS FOR CANNABIS.

Richard H. Schwartz, M.D.
Department o f Pediatrics, Georgetown University, School o f M edicine,
W ashington, D.C.

ABSTRACT
When warning signs o f cannabis abuse occur in student, it is far
better to light a candle, by ordering tests for drugs o f abuse in urine,
than to curse to darkness. When clinically indicated, drug tests m ay
well foreshorten the clinical diagnosis of cannabis abuse by one year
or more. In private pediatric practice, such requensts ususally come
from the student's parents or guidance counselor in response to
marked deterioration in academic performance, serious problems
with cond u ct at h om e or sch oo l, and ep isod es o f observed
intoxication or possession of drugs. While obtaining a routine social
and m edical history, I have found that positive answers to four
questions alert me to a possible drug abuse problem. (1) Do you
sm oke cigarettes every day? (2) How m any tim es have you been
drunk and, if more than once, when was the last tim e ? (3) Did you
receive more than one D or F grade on your last report card? (4) Are
you into partying? Positive responses to several o f the above item s,
especially when there is a strong fam ily history o f alcoholism or
parental or sibling drug abuse. A series o f positive tests offers
eloquent testim ony as to loss of control over the drug in question. A
series of negative tests offers strong support to innocence and causes
other than drug use m ust be sought for. Im m uno-assay screening
tests for cannabis are today, acceptably accurate, rapidly performed,
and informative. It is necessaary for the clinician to understand the
specific terminology of drug tests and to be aware o f the pitfalls in
interpreting results of such tests.

TESTING FOR DRUGS IN THE MILITARY
AND TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY
Paul J. Mulloy*
United States Naval Academy, McLean, VA 22102

ABSTRACT
For the past ten years, the U.S. Navy has used a ten point
program to satisfactorily control alcoholism and illicit drug
consumption, which in 1980 involved 27.6% of all uniformed
personnel. These ten points comprise:
1) Assessment
2) Policy formulation
3) Policy communication
4) Counseling assistance and treatment
5) Training and education
6) Security
7) External support
8) Alternatives
9) Testing
10) Quality assurance
Success in the armed forces ensured a more productive and
effective military, and set an example for other organizations. The
regulated transportation industry and postal service experienced
similar benefits after initiating a similar policy based on employee
assistance programs, education and testing. Along with leadership,
testing is a key component, and recent studies correlate testing
results to performance prediction.

In 1990 the U.N. subcommittee on narcotics reported that the
international illicit drug trade approximated $500 billion and was growing. *
In addressing events that are occurring with regards to illicit drugs in
mass transportation in the United States, it is helpful to review the origin and
progress within the federal government. The first most comprehensive program
to combat illicit drug use began in 1981 in the military. An anonymous written
survey conducted throughout all services in 1980 revealed that 27.6% of all
uniformed personnel had used drugs in the past 30 days.^ The Navy validated
the written survey with a urinalysis-based survey of their young (18-24 year old)
members. It revealed that 47% of their young enlisted sailors had marijuana in
their urine.3
The Navy used a Ten Point Program which I have shared with federal
agencies, other governments and corporations over the past decade. It is a
reference for the program that the Department of Transportation has used for its
directive for all its administrations. These are the ten components:
1.
Assessment: Survey employees to evaluate their attitudes
towards illegal drug usage and to provide a foundation for the
formulation of an effective drug-free workplace policy.
2.
Policy Formulation: Work with employees to develop a
comprehensive drug-free workplace policy. Seek maximum
employee participation while encouraging compliance with
on-site drug testing as the cornerstone of an effective drugfree workplace program.
3.
Program and Policy Communication:
Provide each
employee with written and verbal instructions on the policy
and procedures that will be utilized by the employer to
conduct on-site drug tests to achieve the goals set by the drugfree workplace program.
4.
Education and Training: Emphasize educational and training
programs for employees so that each employee is fully aware
of 1) the manner in which the drug-free workplace program
works and 2) the value the program provides in enhanced
safety on the work site and improved productivity of fellow
workers.
5.
Counseling, Treatment and Rehabilitation: Provide access
to qualified professional counseling assistance and residential
treatment programs for any employee needing addiction
intervention assistance.
6.
Security Improvements: Establish an effective worksite
security program to protect workers from exposure to illegal
drug activities and protect them from an unsafe working
environment created by addictive behavior of a fellow
employee.
7.
External Support: Utilize government and private sector
substance abuse programs for employees needing treatment.

Section III. Detection , Identification and Testing

8.

Substance A b use A lte rn a tiv e s : Develop work site programs

which provide alternatives to employees who might otherwise
engage in substance abuse behavior.
9.
T e s tin g : Incorporate commercially available, state-of-the-art
urinalysis-based drug testing tools, including on-site devices,
to maximize work site safety while assuring maximum
protection for the individual rights of employees.
10.
Q u a lity A ssu ra n c e : Continuously reevaluate each segment of
the drug-free workplace program to assure employees are
provided the maximum protection and that the goals of the
drug-free workplace program are being achieved.
Success in the Armed Forces not only set an example for other
organizations, it ensured a more productive and effective military. The
regulated transportation industry has experienced similar benefits since it
inaugurated its program which has Policy, Employee Assistance Programs,
Education and Testing as bedrock components. Even so, from the beginning I
have stressed that waging and winning the War on Drugs is fundamentally a
leadership campaign wherein the top executive needs to take charge and be held
responsible but aided by experts in the legal, medical, clergy, scientific and law
enforcement professions. In gaining a drug-free workplace, I believe in a zero
tolerance policy. But it should be one designed to get rid of the abuse more than
the abuser.
Key provisions should include providing immunity from
prosecution for those who come forward for help with their substance abuse
problem while applying clearly defined and enforced sanctions for those who
continue to violate the law.
Along with leadership, testing is a key component and recent
significant studies correlate testing results to performance prediction.
In 1990, Dr. David Blank concluded a controlled urinalysis study of
1,000 Navy recruits/* The study comprised 500 recruits who tested positive for
marijuana use and 500 who tested negative. After 4 years, 70% of those who
tested negative were performing satisfactorily and were eligible for
reenlistment. However, only 46% of those who tested positive still remained in
the Navy. Significantly, 35% of those discharged were for performance and
substance abuse-related reasons.
Another study was conducted since 1987 by the United States Postal
Service^ which tested 4,375 applicants at 21 facilities throughout the country.
Those who initially tested positive were absent from work 66% more than non­
drug users. Members who tested positive were also fired 69% more frequently
than those who tested negative. Those findings resulted in a policy that no
applicants who tested positive would be hired.
What these illustrate is the significance of pre-employment testing.
However, there is a societal issue which needs examination in the decision of
not hiring - or hiring with such identification.
Proceeding to the transportation industry in 1987, an Amtrak train
accident resulted in 16 deaths, 174 injuries and $57 million dollars in damages.
The engineer at the controls tested positive for marijuana. That accident added
impetus to the Department of Transportation promulgating its very
comprehensive rules and regulations in 1988 which included a broad spectrum
of testing. These included: pre-employment for applicants, reasonable cause,
post-accident, periodic and random testing.
In Urban Mass Transportation (now the Federal Transit Ad­
ministration) the rules affect about 195,000 people and in the Federal Railroad
Administration about 90,000. The Federal Highway Administration covers
4,000,000 people and the Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for

329

330

over 410,000 people. The Department of Transportation requires testing for the
so-called NIDA (National Institute of Drug Abuse) 5 substances: Marijuana,
Cocaine, Amphetamines, Phencyclidine (PCP) and Opiates. They allow
employers to test for more where there is reasonable cause. This year by
Congressional direction, requirements are being expanded to include alcohol
and split sample specimen collection. Like the military, they also require an
extensive laboratory quality control proficiency and inspection regime with the
National Institute on Drugs.
Random drug testing in American railroads began a phase-in basis in
Januanr 1990. Based on 35,000 tests, a positive rate of 1.04% was reported for
1990.° 194 specimens were found positive for cocaine, 175 were found positive
for marijuana, 10 for opiates and 2 for PCP. FRA rules also require the
collection of blood and urine specimens following certain major train accidents,
collisions and employee fatalities.
In addition to random testing, the Federal Railroad administration has
also tested for drug use since 1986. Post- accident results are down from 5.6%
in 1988 to 1.1% in 1991, for reasonable cause from 5.4% in 1988 to 2.4% in
1990. For marijuana, the number of cases decreased for the following causes:
post accident decreased from 25 in 1988 to 6 in 1991, and reasonable cause
decreased from 222 in 1988 to 90 in 1990.
In the Federal Transit Administration (Mass Transit) a self-reported
survey published this past November^, employees in safety sensitive positions
reported illicit drug use as 29.1% having ever used, 7.2% in past year and 6.9%
in the past month. Significantly, employees indicated cocaine as the dominant
drug. Almost 7% of sensitive safety employees acknowledged drug use on the
day before or on the day of their work duty. Over 10% reported daily or weekly
use. Mandated testing of this industry will commence in 1993 under the FTA.
In aviation, the FAA announced the results of its first year of drug
testing for employees and applicants in July 1991.** 230,621 tests were
administered in 1990. Of these, 966 (0.4%) were positive. 46% were detected
in pre-employment and none was hired for safety sensitive positions. „ 520 or
54% of the positives were found in aviation safety security positions mainly
through random testing. They were removed from their positions. The majority
were maintenance or maintenance applicants. Flight crew members and
applicants accounted for 28. Approximately 340,000 aviation employees are
subject to drug testing.
These early results for drugs in all the transportation industries are
encouraging. As the coverage and reporting of mass transit systems expand, a
more comprehensive assessment will be made from a new information system.
However, I do caution that results currently reported throughout the
United States are based on what I consider to be high cut-off levels set, for
example, at 100 mg/ml for screening of THC marijuana, much higher than
needed to counter claims of passive inhalation. The U.S. Navy set this level in
1982 partly to allow service personnel an opportunity to change in a strategy of
deterrence more than detection. With the massive publicity and years of
expanding the effort, lower cut offs should be instituted as the military is doing
this year. As national and industry specific screening results show a downward
trend, I recommend in a program of deterrence and detection that the cut off
levels be correspondingly lowered. One laboratory director estimated that 60%
higher positive finding would result when screening cut off was lowered from
100 mg/ml to 20 mg/ml in a sample size of 1,000 specimens.^
Taking the lead, the military in January of this year lowered screening
cut offs for marijuana to 50 mg/ml and for cocaine 150 (from 300),
confirmations are at 15 and 150 respectively for each substance and the U.S.

Section III. Detection , Identification and Testing

Department of Transportation has indicated they will follow suit.
Unquestionably in the military and in industry as well as national, the trends are
encouraging. The military, as a whole, decreased to 4% since 1981. The Navy
is now below 1% usage. But with 49% of the high school seniors surveyed still
saying they have used drugs, and the rise in cocaine and heroin, the battle is still
on.
The latest report on emergency room admissions indicates a rise in 1991
in incidents of heroin and cocaine use. With these indices, without a doubt,
testing is still a very necessary deterrent and detection tool. In a survey I had
conducted in the Navy, 83% of the young people said testing was the #1
deterrent. Perhaps more significant, 27% said they would resume using drugs if
testing were halted! 11
In addition to laboratory testing, with technical improvements today, I
strongly recommend use of on-site testing. The screening devices currently
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing are
98% presumptive accurate or better; results are obtained in minutes; and they
convey significant cost savings in time and money compared to laboratory
screening practices by avoiding delays, chain of custody, and expensive
laboratory procedures.
For employees it reduces anxiety by providing
immediate results. It is especially useful in pre-screening applicants for
employment Of course on a presumptive positive test and to safeguard
individual rights, I recommend laboratory confirmation with gas
chromotography/mass spectrometry.
When one considers the average laboratory takes 24 hours to 72 hours
to report urinalysis test results and a pilot of a 747 or express train engineers,
school bus driver or dangerous machinery operator may be involved, why not
gain a highly accurate, timely, simple presumptive finding to remove hazard and
enhance public safety?
Procedures to protect confidentially, improper
disclosure, access to information and rigorously limit embarrassment can be
developed for even the most sensitive positions. Surely to protect the public
trust, greatly improve public safety and confidence we can accept such
provisions. We do it in many ways for lesser reasons and waiting for the next
tragic accident is hardly prevention oriented. On-site testing (with proper safe­
guards) helps achieves these objective now. And of course, to industry, the cost
avoidance can be significant. In the U.S., laboratory costs for processing a
specimen average $23-25, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget cites $5060; and an official with a major defense contractor told me that their accountants
estimate that total costs associated with collecting, processing and reporting a
specimen results amounts to $100/specimen. With on-site drug testing, plates
costing about $10 to detect four drugs is about ten recruits. Drug Screening
Systems, Inc. of Blackwood, New Jersey, a new on-site drug testing company,
offers a plate of four drugs called Mach IV for about $12 and reduced cost for
orders of 100. This capability should be universally examined and employed.
In the U.S., with surveys indicating that less than 20% of the workforce use
drugs, that predicates a potential 80% reduction in laboratory submission when
on-site testing is employed. In an incremental adaptation, on-site pre­
employment screening might be a good place to start.
Without question, the War on Drugs will be a long one. The enemy is
drugs but its purveyors are criminally brilliant in all spheres of a global
business: shipping, banking, law, accounting, terrorism and interlocking
financial and distribution systems. Recently liberated Eastern Europe and
former Soviet Union are prey to these enemies who have hard currency to offer
those who are in desperate economic straits.
Civilization, as we know it, is at risk from the scourge of illicit drugs.
Interdiction efforts are important but Demand Reduction is crucial. Conducting

proper surveys help overcome denial and sensitize leaders and policy makers to
the issue. Education, rehabilitation and testing are key to ensure there is
assistance available for users to counter addiction. The workplace should be the
focus to program success and the CEO should personally commit to this
leadership effort. The workers will respond and expose the dealers and users
from a comprehensive program which has both compassion and enforced
sanctions in its policy.
Properly implemented, the knowledge and
countervailing skills will flow back into the home and community. Emphasis on
the workplace will reduce demand and put the thugs (not lords) and gangs (not
cartels) out of business. We know the way, the question is do we have the will?
In my judgement, we must.

G EN ER A L CONCLUSIONS

An international colloquium on illicit drugs organized with the
assistance of the City of Paris was held at the National Academy of
Medicine in Paris April 8 - 9, 1992. The program dealt essentially
with human effects of cannabis consumption, and the following
general conclusions were drawn at the end of the colloquium:
1. The toxicity of cannabis is today well established,
experimentally and clinically. This drug adversely effects the
central nervous system, the lung, immunity and reproductive
function.
2.

Epidemiological studies have reported that the use of "hard
drugs” rarely occurs among subjects who have never consumed
cannabis.

3.

Consequently, the participants to this colloquium rebut the
distinction made between "soft" and "hard" drugs.

4. The trivialization ("decriminalization") of cannabis use, where
it has occurred, has resulted in a considerable increase of its
consumption and of its subsequent damaging effects.
5.

It is important to foster a campaign of information and
prevention bearing both on the legal aspects and the health
consequences of cannabis consumption.

HASHISH AND MENTAL ELLNESS: THE EXPERIENCE AND
OBSERVATIONS OF MOREAU 1

Hélène Peters
Macalaster College, Saint-Paul, Minnesota.

Jacques-Joseph Moreau (1804-1884) was born in Montresor, a small town in the
Loire valley. His father, an officer in the armies of Napoleon, fought in many
battles, and retired after Waterloo to devote himself to the study of mathematics.
Moreau first studied medicine in Tours, near his home town, hence the surname
he added to his own when he later went to Paris. His first teacher was a very
famous clinician of his time, Bretonneau. The period was still the prescientific era
of medicine, which was based primarily on the study of gross anatomy and
pathology. Physiology as a science did not exist. One man could still learn every­
thing that was known about medicine, and Moreau attempted to do just that.
Psychiatry had hardly emerged as a specialty.
When he was 20 years old he went to Paris to complete his studies and earned
his degree of doctor of medicine. At 22 he applied for the position of assistant
physician in the largest mental hospital in France, just outside Paris; L'Asile
d’Alienes de Charenton. The hospital director was Jean Etienne Esquirol, one of
the first physicians to consider mental patients as sick people who should not be
shackled, and should be treated with care, concern, and kindness. Moreau learned
a great deal from his master and his associates, including Pinel and Aubert.
At that time a prolonged voyage to a distant and exotic land in the company of
a psychiatrist was a customary treatment for mental illness among the wealthy
people of France and Europe. Moreau accompanied patients to Egypt and the
Orient. During his trips he observed that the Arabs used hashish as an intoxicant
as commonly as the Turks or Chinese used opium and the Europeans used alcoholic
beverages. Moreau was impressed by the unusual effects of this substance on the
mind and on the behavior of Oriental people. Back in Paris in 1840, the year of
Esquirofs death, Moreau was appointed physician of the Bicetre mental hospital.
He decided then to experiment systematically with hashish and began the first
recorded clinical experiments on the psychopharmacology of C annabis extracts.
Moreau seems to have prepared his own hashish. He used a crude preparation,
the fat-extracted material which the Arabs call “dawamese."
The flowering tops of the plant are boiled in water to which fresh butter has been
added. When this concoction has been reduced by evaporation to a syrupy liquid, it

1 condensed from "J.J. Moreau, Hashish and Mental Illness". H. Peters and G.G. Nahas,
Editors, Raven Press, New York, 1972.

is strained through a cloth. One thus obtains a butter of greenish color which contains
the active ingredient. This extract is never absorbed in its pure form because of its
obnoxious and nauseous odor. It is sweetened with sugar and flavored with scented
fruit or flower extracts. When freshly prepared the finished product is not too un­
pleasant to the taste, but it becomes rancid.

“However,” according to Moreau, “this extract keeps its intoxicating properties
for as long as ten years.”
Moreau might have prepared his own extracts in order to avoid the many additives
(ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and powder of cantharides) added by the Arabs. How­
ever, he had to start with imported plants of C annabis. His attempts, with his
friend Aubert, to grow the plant near Bicetre yielded a variant, which contained
minimal active ingredient, insufficient to produce intoxication.
Moreau claims that one has to ingest an amount of his hashish preparation equal
to a walnut (30 g) to obtain any results. Because such a large dose was necessary,
Moreau’s extract could not contain more than 0.5 % delta-9-THC: In 30 g this
would amount to 150 mg of the drug, a very large dose. With one-half or onequarter of this dose, says Moreau, “. . . one will feel happy and gay, and one might
have a few fits of uncontrollable laughter.” But it is only with much higher dosage
(which Moreau and his pupils ingested) that one obtains the profound effects
designated in the Orient by the word “fantasia.”
Moreau and his pupils went about their experimentation in a very systematic
way. They took many different doses of hashish. The pharmacist of the hospital,
after a specially high dosage (3 doses, or about 90 g), presented for 3 days a
psychotic episode, with hallucinations, incoherence, and great agitation. All the
experimenters took notes during their intoxications, giving detailed accounts of all
their symptoms. They observed each other carefully, and exchanged and discussed
their impressions, feelings, and thoughts during and after hashish intoxication.
As a result of this experimentation in the clinical pharmacology of hashish,
Moreau published in 1845 a book, H ashish and M ental A lienation. Alienation was
the common medical term to describe mental illness or madness. No better account
of the acute effects of C a n n a bis intoxication on mental function has been given
since Moreau’s own descriptions, which will be summarized here and which earned
the author one of the first prizes awarded by the National Academy of Medicine.

“Hashish Intoxication and Mental Illness”
Moreau candidly describes the purpose of his experimentation with hashish.
Most psychiatrists have carefully described the infinite variety of symptoms of the
many patients with whom they have lived, but I do not know one who, in speaking
of madness, has given us the benefit of his personal experience, or described it from
the point of view of his own perceptions and sensations. Only curiosity originally led
me to experiment upon myself with hashish. Later, it was difficult to forget the
exciting memory of some of the effects I owed to this drug. But, from the very outset,
I was motivated by another reason: 1 had seen in hashish, or more specifically in its
effect upon the mental faculties, a powerful and unique method of exploring the
genesis of mental illness.
Madness most frequently explodes without the afflicted being warned by any
appreciable impairment of the organism, and his physician is unable to relate it to any
physical malfunction. This is a first point of similarity between the effects of hashish

Appendix

345
and mental illness. The cause is obvious, but the origin remains unknown. This is
what most often happens when that cause acts directly on the organ of the mind. We
shall see that the manifestations of hashish intoxication are completely analogous to
those reported by mental patients. Mental patients and eaters of hashish express
themselves similarly when they want to convey their experiences; it seems that both
groups have been under the same morbid influence.
I have compared the principal characteristics observed in mental illness to the
symptoms caused in me by hashish intoxication. The insights provided by my own
study gave me a better understanding of mental illness.

Moreau next lists the eight cardinal symptoms which are either observed during
hashish intoxication or reported by mental patients. They are, in order of increasing
mental disorganization:
Unexplainable feeling of bliss, happiness
Excitement; dissociation of ideas
Errors of time and space appreciation
Development of the sense of hearing; the influence of music
Fixed ideas (delusions)
Damage to the emotions
Irresistible impulses
Illusions; hallucinations

Feeling of Happiness
It is a feeling of physical and mental comfort, of inner satisfaction, of intimate joy;
that you seek mainly to understand or analyze that for which you cannot find the
cause.
It is really happiness that hashish gives, and by that I mean totally mental joys, not
at all sensual as one might be tempted to believe. It is a very curious fact from which
one can draw strange conclusions: All joy, all contentment, even though their cause
is strictly mental, and our most spiritual, idealistic enjoyments could well be in reality
only purely physical sensations, developed in the core of our brain exactly like those
produced by hashish.

This is the first hint ever made at the existence of brain reward mechanisms
centered in the limbic area. They were described by Heath one hundred years later
(1954); they are chemically regulated and may be triggered by dependence-pro­
ducing drugs.
Freud, nearly a century later (1931), also suggested a similar mechanism of
action for “intoxicants," which when present in the blood or tissues directly cause
us pleasurable sensations. “The symptoms we have just described also occur fre­
quently at the beginning of mental illness: They are the feelings of happiness, of
intimate joy in which the sick find so much hope, so much confidence in the future
and which, alas, are only precursory symptoms of more violent insanity."
Moreau gives several examples of mental patients who in the course of their
illness experienced great joy with no apparent reason. It was a young woman of
fine, observing mind, convalescing from “a mania" secondary to childbirth who
told Moreau: “In the night, I woke up with a feeling of comfort I cannot describe.
I felt happy as I never had. My happiness, my joy, were overflowing and I felt a

346

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

need to share them with my surroundings. I waited impatiently for daylight to
announce the good news. I was wild with delight; I wanted to embrace everybody,
even my servants.”

Excitement: Dissociation of Ideas
One of the first noticeable effects of hashish is the gradual weakening of the power
that we have to orient our thoughts as we wish. Imperceptibly, we feel ourselves
overwhelmed by strange ideas unrelated to those on which we want to concentrate.
The action of hashish weakens the will— the mental power that rules ideas and
connects them together. Memory and imagination then predominate.
So long as the disorder has not gone beyond certain bounds, one readily recognizes
the mistake in which one is temporarily involved; there occurs an uninterrupted
succession of false ideas and true ideas, of dreams and of realities, which constitute
a sort of composite state of madness and reason and make a person seem to be mad
and rational at the same time.

Moreau compares the dream state of hashish intoxication with the twilight of
consciousness of the person who, while still asleep, is aware that he is dreaming
and wishes to prolong his dream. Superimposed on the dream state and the free
flowing of the stream of consciousness, there is a state of emotional lability and
an exacerbation of sensory perceptions.
The train of our ideas can be broken by the slightest thing; we undergo the most
contradictory influences. We turn in all directions. By a word, a gesture, our thoughts
can be directed in succession to a multitude of diverse subjects with a speed and yet
with a clearness that is marvelous. A deep feeling of pride takes hold of you with the
growing exaltation of your faculties which you feel are growing in energy and power.

Moreau concludes that this aspect of C a n n a bis intoxication, with its composite
mental excitement where "fragments” of the imagination constantly interact with
enhanced sensory perception, recalls the symptoms of "manic” madness in all its
details.
Under the influence of hashish, the mind can fall into the strangest errors concerning
time and space. Time seems at first to drag with a slow ness that exasperates. Minutes
become hours, hours, days. Soon, with more and more exaggeration, all precise ideas
of the duration of time escape us, the past and the present are merged. The speed
with which our thoughts follow one another and the resulting dream state explains
this phenomenon. Time seems longer than when it is measured by terrestrial clocks
because the actions or the facts contained in an interval of time, by virtue of their
intensity, extend the limits of this interval.
The phenomenon we have just described may be compared with certain extravagant
ideas that are sometimes encountered in psychotics. Some of them believe they are a
hundred, a thousand years old. The young women I mentioned earlier believed in the
first days of her manic illness that she had no age. She imagined that she had lived
in all the historical periods which she could remember. “I accused those who sur­
rounded me of stealing from me the measure of time; for me, it no longer exists. I
told them. My days and nights passed in an instant too rapidly for me to be able to
carry out all the vast plans that filled my mind. I refused to recognize my mother for
the reason that l could not have a mother younger than I was."

Appendix

347
The action of hashish could not cause impressions as distorted as those I have just
indicated. With the awareness of himself, one easily recognizes the illusion by which
psychotics are naturally deceived and one avoids drawing, as they do, extravagant
conclusions.

Development of the Sense of Hearing: The Influence of Music
Moreau first recalls, despite their poetic exaggeration, the words that Gautier
used to describe this phenomenon: “My hearing was fantastically sharpened. I
heard the sound of colors— green, red, blue and yellow sounds in perfectly distinct
waves.. . . An overturned glass echoed through me like thunder..
“I have observed these effects in several people," adds Moreau. “I have witnessed
their cries of joy, their songs, their tears and their lament, their deep depression or
their foolish mirth, depending on the harmonic mode in which sound reached their
ears."
Pleasant or unpleasant, happy or sad, the emotions that music creates are only
comparable to those one feels in a dream. It is not enough to say that they are more
vivid than those of the waking state. Their character is transformed, and it is only
upon reaching a hallucinatory state that they assume their full strength and can induce
real paroxysms of pleasure or pain. At that moment, the immediate, direct action of
the harmonics and the actual auditory sensations are combined with the most varied
and fiery emotions which result from the assocations of ideas created by the combi­
nation of sounds.
One day, I had taken a strong dose of hashish. When I had reached a sufficiently
high state of intoxication, in order to subdue the mettle of my ideas and feelings by
imparting to them a single direction, I begged a young lady artist to sit at the piano
to play a sad and melancholic tune. She chose a waltz by Weber. From the first notes
of this tune, so deeply imprinted with sorrow, I felt a chill go through my entire
body. The waltz evoked in me only sad thoughts and distressing memories. The faces
of several people surrounding me reflected the sinister mood of my imagination. A
sadness, a somber melancholy, a painful anxiety overtook me. The prayer from the
opera Moses gradually restored calm in my soul. I had that physical and mental feeling
of comfort that one experiences upon waking from a bad dream or that one enjoys at
the end of a bout of fever.
I had not been deceived for a moment of my illusions, although these illusions had
affected me like reality itself.

Moreau explains the causes of the rapture produced by music during hashish
intoxication. There is first a physical, “organic," basis to this condition, and
C a n n a bis must stimulate the organs associated with hearing. “The overstimulation
that hashish causes in the whole nervous system is felt most particularly in the
portion of this system concerned with the perception of sounds. Hearing acquires
an unbelievable sensitivity."
In the second place, Moreau stresses the power of music to stimulate the imag­
ination and to recall old memories, which confers to harmony its social significance.
“To feel music it must be understood, which is to say that sounds must be associated
with familiar ideas. Music plays a minimal part in the emotions you feel, memory
and imagination do most of the recollection." Stimulation of imagination by hashish
also explains the influence of music on the hashish experience. “Memories of

348

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology , Detection

mourning and death ally themselves immediately with sad songs, happy thoughts
with gay songs, religious memories with religious songs, and these thoughts and
memories exert an almost unlimited influence upon one’s judgment.”
“When conscious thinking is obliterated by hashish, the mind abandons itself to
impressons which are no more considered in perspective and assume a greatly
exaggerated importance.”

Fixed Ideas (Delusions)
“This ‘intellectual lesion,* so frequent in mental illness, is also caused by hashish,
but only when intoxication has progressed to an advanced stage, a stage which one
would seldomly reach deliberately.”
Moreau experienced delusions only once, when he was first experimenting with
the drug and might have absorbed too large a dose. The idea occurred to him that
he had been poisoned by his colleagues, and this idea progressively took hold of
his mind, dominating all other thoughts in the most absolute manner. He even
accused his colleague, Dr. Aubert-Roche, of being an assassin. The denials he
received only strengthened his conviction, and he could not recognize the absurdity
of his thought. Another delusion, much more extravagant, followed: He was dead,
his soul had left his body, and he was on the verge of being buried.
In the case of mental illness, delusions are essentially characterized by their total and
exclusive domination over the mind, as if they had absorbed the individual’s person­
ality. Delusions caused by hashish are similar. They can only exist with their distinctive
characteristics when the consciousness and the ego are impaired and involved in the
overall disintegration of the mind.
We all have fantastic ideas crossing our mind, of power, love, wealth, immortality;
in the waking state— in our state of reflective power and complete independence, of
self-power— we consider all of these fantasies playing in our mind as if they were in
some way alien to us. The slightest impulse of our will makes them change endlessly.
Like images from a kaleidoscope moved by the hand, we clear them away without
any effort.
If, as a result of the action of hashish, this intellectual capacity weakens and
disappears temporarily, the fantasy, that had only crossed our mind before, is trans­
formed into a conviction, a fixed idea, because our judgment, directed by inner
consciousness, cannot combat it, accuse it of error and discard it. With hashish,
unless intoxication is excessive, the delusions are very short-lived.

Moreau attributes the appearance and fixation of delusions in the mind to a
primary “excitement” of brain function which he “wishes eagerly to explain clearly.”
His insight leads him to define the cause of delusions in terms which modern
psychopharmacologists would not reject. This phenomenon of mental excitement
“which precedes delusion I would willingly call a dissolution, a m o lecu la r d isin ­
tegration o f in tellig en ce , if I dared explain it as I feel it. A delusion is the result
of this disintegration.”
When Moreau examines the circumstances under which delusions develop among
mental patients, he believes that these delusions are preceded by “a confusion of
all the elements of intelligence and a general disorder of the mind.”

Appendix

I call attention to the observations of physicians who have considerable experience
with psychotics. When their patients were in a condition to understand them, the
physicians often asked them: “How did your illness begin? How could you put in your
head such absurd, extravagant ideas?” Answer: “I became so sad, I was so sick that
I was completely confused; I was no longer normal; I had lost my bearings; my ideas
were all upside down; I did not know what I was saying or doing, and 1 imagined
th a t ...” This is the start of the delusion which will later dominate all thought
processes and will survive the general confusion, the upheaval of the faculties of the
mind. Delusions do not always rapidly overwhelm the intelligence of mental patients.
Sometimes delusions will have to struggle with the inner consciousness: this is the
moment of uncertainty, of indecision, of anxiety, of extreme flight of ideas. These
delusions follow patterns of waning and waxing, disappearing and reappearing with
still greater intensity.
Subjective observation by the inner consciousness of the mental processes in hashish
intoxication has also enabled me to establish that dissociation of ideas and the resulting
dream state were the primary source of delusions. Delusions can only be the result
of a general upheaval of our mental faculties. A delusion is not an error in thinking.
A psychotic does not make a mistake. He functions in an intellectual sphere essentially
different from our own. He has a conviction against which neither the reason of
someone else, nor his own, can prevail; no more than any reasoning, any thought of
the waking state can rectify the reasoning and thinking of the dream state. The same
difference exists between the psychotic and the sane man as between the man who
dreams and the man who is awake.
Delusions are only separated parts, temporary manifestations of a dream state that
extends into the waking state.

By a systematic analysis into the origin of delusions as they appear under the
influence of hashish or in the course of mental illness, Moreau became convinced
of the primary organic nature of mental disturbances.

Disturbance of the Emotions and “Swinging Moods”
Moreau first describes, by using his own “subjective awareness,” the labile
emotional state and “swinging moods” associated with C annabis intoxication.
With hashish, the emotions display the same degree of overexcitement as the intellec­
tual faculties. They have the mobility and also the despotism of the ideas. The more
one feels incapable of directing his thoughts, the more one loses the power to resist
the emotions they create. The violence of these emotions is boundless when the
disorder of the intellect has reached the point of incoherence.

The emotional instability induced by hashish explains the importance of set and
setting on the drug-induced experience.
Depending on the circumstances, on the objects that you see, and the words that you
hear, you will experience the most vivid feelings of happiness or sorrow, the most
contradictory passions with unusual violence. If something frightens us, we are soon
assailed by fears, unexplainable anxieties which cast a dark shroud on all our sur­
roundings. One day in the midst of a strong hashish intoxication my ears were suddenly
struck by the sounds of bells. This was hardly an hallucination but, being in a bad
mood, I associated to this sound the idea that it was sounding for a funeral.
Those who use hashish in the Orient, when they want to abandon themselves to
the rapture of hashish intoxication, exert an extreme care to eliminate anything that
might turn their madness into depression, or might arouse anything other than pleasant

350

and tender feelings. They take advantage of all the practices that the corrupt customs
of the Orient place at their disposal. In the depths of their harem, surrounded by their
women, under the spell of the music and the suggestive dancing performed by the
dancing girls they relish the intoxicating hashish; and aided by their expectations, they
are transported into the midst of the countless wonders that the Prophet has gathered
in his paradise.

Moreau believes that this unbalanced emotional state cannot be related to any
“main injury to the emotions/’ as many of his contemporaries thought. He attributes
the emotional lability of hashish intoxication to the primary “pathological state” of
the intellect created by the drug.
So long as the association of ideas is regular, so long as the uncontrollable speed of
perception does not disturb the mind, emotions— gay or sad, hateful or kind— are in
no ferment. They remain under the control of the will. The dream state which is the
necessary consequence of hashish intoxication unleashes all of the power of emotions.

Irresistible Impulses
Impulses, those instinctive urges which build up in us almost without our knowledge,
acquire under the influence of hashish an extraordinary driving power, one that is
irresistible if the toxic action is very strong. Impulses are like passions; they draw
their strength from the excitement, the mental disturbance that prevents regular, free
association of ideas. They have their periods of waning and waxing and are only
irresistable at the height of the excitement.

As Moreau recalls, “Seeing an open window in my room I got the idea that if I
wanted I could throw myself from that window. Though I did not think I would
commit such an act, I asked that the window be closed: I was afraid I might get
the idea of jumping out the window. Deep down in my fear, I felt a growing
impulse, and I had an intimate feeling that I might have followed it with a stronger
‘excitement’ .”
Moreau observed very similar manifestations in mental patients:
The actions of psychotics are not always irresistible, although in no case can they be
held responsible. Often these actions are only the logical consequence of false con­
victions. At other times, a particular disposition of his intelligence will thrust the
patient, without any possible resistance, to all his impulses. He will then act without
knowing or realizing what he is doing. These patients then act mechanically, as if
they obeyed a dream, according to their favorite expression.

Illusions and Hallucinations
Illusions and hallucinations, two serious manifestations of mental illness, derive
from the same basic mental change of cerebral excitement “which carries the seed
of all mental pathology as the trunk of a tree, its branches, its leaves, and its
flowers are contained in the grain.”
Progressively, as “excitement“ grows, our mind shuts itself off from external impres­
sions to concentrate more and more on subjective ones; as this kind of metamorphosis
takes place, we are drawn away from real life to be thrown into a world where the
only reality is the one created by our memories and our imagination; progressively.

one becomes the toy, first of simple illusions and then of true hallucinations which
are like the remote sounds, the first lights, which are coming to us from an imaginary
and fantastic world.
Illusions o f H a sh ish Intoxication

When any sort of thing, alive or lifeless, strikes our sight, or when a sound, such as
the song of a bird strikes our ears while the “excitement” is still weak, we feel that
two distinct phenomena are occurring in our mind:
1. We have seen, we have heard, clearly and distinctly as we do in the waking
state.
2. Then suddenly, as the result of certain similarities of which we may or may not
be aware, the image of another object and the sensation of another sound are awakened
within us. As a result of these intracerebral impressions, due to the action of memory
and imagination, the mind pauses, shortly fusing the two sensations into a single one,
covering over the real sensation with the imaginary one and projecting the latter upon
the external object.
Therefore, an illusion is made of two component parts:
1. a sensory impression
2. a cerebral sensation (immediately deriving from the former) and which is totally
due to the action of the imagination. There lies its essential psychic nature.
The external features of an illusion, with the numerous varied forms that it is likely
to assume, will be necessarily borrowed from the particular nature of the mood and
habitual thoughts of a person. It is understandable that images or ideas that have made
the strongest impression on the mind are the first to be awakened or that the cerebral
fibers that vibrate most often are more readily disturbed than others.
Visual illusions.

Moreau subjected visual illusions to analytic study.

We often see the face of a person totally unknown to us but which resembles the face
of a familiar person. This resemblance, however slight, is enough to recall from our
mind the memory of that person; this memory has all the vividness of the sensory
impression, for the mind perceives it in the same manner as it perceives in the dream
state.
From that moment, what we have seen with the eyes of the mind is put in the place
of what we have seen with the eyes of the body. The creations of our imagination
have taken the place of reality. And if all reflective thinking is denied to us by the
violence of the cerebral disturbance due to hashish intoxication, the two sensations
are fused into a single one, and the error is inevitable.

Moreau gives the following example of a visual illusion experienced under the
effects of hashish:
When the visage of the old woman evoked in me the youngest and most attractive
face, I felt perfectly that the subjective image which my overactive imagination had
made me see in a dream was taking the place of the real image. I told myself there
were two explanations to this illusion: (1) in taking hashish, I thought that all sensations
had to be pleasant, that I must see everything as if it was beautiful; (2) the image of
a pretty woman, by the admiration it creates and the emotion it causes, engraves itself
spontaneously and deeply in our mind and consequently may be reproduced with
great ease.
A uditory illusions.
According to Moreau, illusions of hearing are infrequently
caused by hashish intoxication. Rarely are sounds distorted. However, sounds may
be amplified, or give rise to emotions or thoughts which are colored by the

352

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection

prevailing mood. Moreau recalls going to a reception while he was under the
influence of hashish.
Hearing the bells ringing in a nearby church, I asked what it could be. Somebody
answered, “Someone has probably died.'’ Immediately, the last word echoed five or
six times in my ears, as if each person in the room had, in turn, repeated it in a more
and more dismal tone. At that time I was not completely sure of the innocuity of
hashish. 1 feared 1 had taken too high a dose, which explains the sad nature of this
illusion.

Moreau displays great insight as he analyzes the different component parts of
auditory illusions, which, like visual ones, include:
1. A sensory impression, which is the true physical sensation.
2. A second sensation that follows the first immediately, a sensation totally in the
mind and purely subjective.
3. A temporal error of the mind that confounds the two sensations— or, rather,
forgets the first one and only retains the second, from which results the distorted
perception.

This is the first definition known to this author of what psychologists today call
“temporal disintegration or disorganization” (Melges et al., 1970a,b). The mental
condition created by C annabis intoxication is characterized by an impairment of
immediate memory and a disintegration of sequential thought which is essential
for the proper interpretation of sensory perception.
As rapidly as these three phases of an illusion succeed each other, the mind perceives
them distinctly, not at the very moment the manifestation occurs but immediately
after; it is the impression of a dream that remains in the mind and which harkens
back to it. If we were to give a faithful account of this impression we would say, “I
dreamed that I heard .. . " a true statement that a psychotic changes to “/ heard,'’
because he is deprived of his awareness and necessarily confuses the dream state with
the waking state.
Illusions o f g e n e ra l sensibility (aw areness o f body im a ge).
Illusions of general
sensibility cannot be accounted for by the analytic study to which Moreau subjected
auditory and visual ones.

When 1 felt my body grow in size, inflate like a balloon, this sensation, however
unusual, could not be distinguished from ordinary sensations. It was impossible to
distinguish, as in the case of visual or auditory illusions, the actual sensation from
the creation of the imagination. Illusions of general sensibility are the result of special
sensory alterations as real as those that take place in normal sensations. Only the
origin of these changes differs. Contrary to what happens in ordinary sensations, it
is not in the peripheral parts of the organs or at the nerve endings that one first
instinctively locates the source of the abnormal sensation which forms illusion. This
sensation is concentrated entirely in the brain. It is in the central nervous system that
it first develops, and then irradiates to the organs.
Thus, when I felt my body inflate, I passed my hands over my body and I was not
able to confirm this sensation. My hands informed me that my body had kept its
usual size at the very moment that I felt it increase excessively. This contradiction
between my touch and my subjective perception created the strangest ambiguous
experience in me.

353

Appendix

The sensory illusions reported by psychotics are sim ilar, according to Moreau,
to those produced by hashish, provided the dose absorbed is large enough to create
a cerebral disturbance which obliterates awareness.
Supposing a degree of intellectual disturbance sufficiently intense to obliterate in me
all consciousness, as happens among psychotics, we may well imagine that my illusions
might have become the point of departure of delusions similar to those seen in
psychotics. 1 could have believed myself transformed into a bird or a balloon, afraid
of being carried away by a gust of wind or punctured by the slightest shock or burned
by a spark. If the intoxication was intense enough I might believe I had the power of
rising into the air, of flying through space like a bird.
It is exactly what happened to the young man who thought he had been changed
into a steam engine piston.
Several persons, after taking hashish, claimed that their brains started boiling and
the tops of their head rhythmically rose and dropped as if lifted by sprays of steam.
I myself felt a similar sensation. It is one of the sensations which most frightens those
not yet accustomed to hashish.

Moreau distinguishes illusions from delusions or fixed ideas, which need not be
triggered by sensory stimuli. He also distinguishes illusions from hallucinations. In
illusions, the mind is still on the border of a dream state, and the imagination has
not yet shaken off its dependence on external stimuli. The illusion is confined
within certain limits like the activity of the senses to which it is related: Imagination
acts within the limits of the sensory activity; visual and auditory impressions trigger
the appearance of the dream and of the resulting illusion.
H allucinations

By contrast, hallucinations include all the faculties of the mind; their only limits
are those that nature has placed upon the activity of mental functions. As a result,
all mental manifestations may be “hallucinated,” not only those related to the
perception of sounds or images. Hallucinations are the most striking manifestations
of the cerebral disturbance or “excitement” which is produced by hashish intoxi­
cation or by mental illness in which the dream state takes precedence over the
conscious state.
The “hallucinator” hears his own thoughts as he sees and hears the creations of his
imagination, as he is moved by the impressions he uncovers in his memory.
As the action of hashish is more keenly felt, one passes imperceptibly from the
real world into a fictitious world without losing consciousness of oneself. In a way
there exists a sort of fusion between the dream state and the waking state. One dreams
while awake.
One evening I was in a salon, with close friends. We played some music which
helped greatly to stimulate all of my faculties. There came a moment when all my
thoughts and memories carried me back to the Orient. I spoke enthusiastically of the
countries where I had traveled. As I was telling of my departure from Cairo to Upper
Egypt, I suddenly stopped and shouted. “Here! Here! I am now hearing the song of
the sailors rowing on the Nile: A1 bedaoui! A1 bedaoui!“ I repeated this refrain as I
had done in the past.
It was an hallucination because 1 heard clearly and distinctly the songs that in the
past had so often struck my ears.

354

Cannabis: Physiopathology, Epidemiology, Detection
This was the first time I experienced this manifestation in such a distinct and clearcut manner and despite the disturbance of my thoughts, which were whirling in my
mind, I applied myself to study this hallucination as precisely as I could.
This hallucination had only left in my mind the fleeting memory of a dream. I
perceived only a difference in the degree of intensity between the memory and the
impression itself.
I dreamed I heard: I believed that I was hearing with that full and complete
conviction that one has when dreaming. Such was the invariable response that I made
to myself when I sought to account for what I had felt. I responded with complete
presence of mind to the questions that were asked concerning the songs I said I was
hearing. Several times I had the occasion to assure myself that other hallucinators
experienced impressions of this type. They invariably described these same impres­
sions: “I dreamed that I saw; I dreamed that I heard; and yet I knew perfectly well
where I was, who was around me. It was unbelievable.”
Exactly the same thing happens in the dream state; it is our own thoughts that we
express and to which we respond when we converse with other people in dreams.
These are various impressions that we have formerly received which repeat themselves
and which we associate and combine in all sorts of ways. All these manifestations
derive essentially from the dream state, and one should not mistake them for the
hearing of voices when the intellectual faculties have not undergone a change.
At times it happens that wt are suddenly awakened by voices that we had been
hearing in a dream. And we are as keenly impressed by these voices as if they were
real, to the extent that we have to think for a few moments in order to convince
ourselves that we were dreaming.
Let us suppose now' that these manifestations recur intermittently and that in the
intervals we are perfectly lucid. We will then have an idea of what happens in hashish
intoxication and in other mental disturbances where hallucinations occur.

The Primary Organic Nature of Mental Illness
By a systematic analysis of the symptoms described by mental patients considered
in the light of observations during his own hashish intoxication, Moreau became
convinced of the primarily organic nature of mental illness. This conviction brings
him to point out “the little differences between the folly of the ‘demented’ (schiz­
ophrenic) and that of the manics. The difference in the two conditions being more
a matter of degree of the same basic lesion on the combined mental faculties." He
tries to define this abnormal cerebral condition “as a general state of excitement
of mental faculties, a rapid and confused agitation of ideas, a dynamic nervous
lesion, a kind of oscillatory movement of nervous activity." This functional lesion
cannot exist, according to Moreau, independently of the brain (Fig. 1). It is linked
to a completely material and molecular change, however imperceptible its nature,
“imperceptible as the changes that take place in the intimate texture of a rope upon
which one applies vibrating motions of variable intensity."
The existence of this organic change is revealed to us with complete certainty by
subjective observation; but how are we to discover its traces when life is gone from
the organs, even supposing that this change can leave traces? Take apart, piece by
piece, the keyboard that gives so discordant sounds when touched by inexperienced
hands, and you will look in vain for the cause of the disharmony that offended your
ears. Similarly in your search for the cause of a psychosis you would look in vain at
the inner texture (histology) of the brain which will have presented a functional
disturbance for some time.

And what are the causes of this primordial change in brain activity? Moreau
mentions the small number of known reasons such as physical, mental, and path­
ological changes which abruptly shock mental faculties and exaggerate their action.
In his opinion,
the psychological reasons that appear so frequently in the development of madness
are onl> secondary and have an occasional value. They do not contain in themselves
the po\wr necessary to cause the disease. There is almost always a latent, more or
less pronounced, organic predisposition. That is why one sees the most insignificant
psychological reason trigger the explosion of the most violent disturbances. Perhaps
this explains why, when we see “psychological reasons“ triggering so easily mental
disturbances, methods of the same nature are so ineffective in curing them.

And finally, Moreau recognizes our ignorance concerning the great number of
other possible organic causes of mental illness. He hints at some which will be
recognized more than a century later as probable enzymatic changes. “We com­
pletely ignore the greater number of causes, those which are hidden, and made
(synthetized) in the secret depth of our tissues, which are discharged from one
system into another and are transmitted by inheritance.”
Moreau’s generalizations created great controversies among his contemporaries,
who defined insanity as a purely functional disturbance of intelligence and classified
the manifestations of mental illness in a strictly symptomatic way according to the
different categories of the mind: There were the lesions of the emotions, the lesions
of the will, the lesions of the instincts.

356

To formulate his hypothesis of the primarily organic nature of mental illness,
Moreau utilized to the fullest possible extent all tools available to him in 1840:
C a n n a b is , the only drug known at the time to profoundly disturb mental function;
his own extraordinary insight; and his keen sense of clinical observation. Now,
some 140 years later, in spite of all the many investigative tools in neurophysiology,
neurochemistry, and psychopharmacology at their disposal, psychiatrists are still
pondering the basic nature of mental illness and the validity of Moreau’s theory.
And no one is ready to answer Moreau’s following query: "What is the lesion of
the brain, what is the disposition of cerebral molecules which may be correlated
with the false convictions, the erroneous ideas which are common to all of us,
from the most learned to the most ignorant?”

In man, social factors such as group formations among children and
adolescents, broken home situation, educational system and subculture,
each factor separately or in combination, are determinants for the
development of drug addiction. Group influences are also seen in be­
havioural manifestations of the drug effects themselves. Altogether,
the role of human society in the manifestation of drug abuse is very
important.
This is the main reason to test hallucinogenic substances in animals,
living together in highly organized communities - namely in insect
societies. We selected ants for these investigations, because they
live in high number in a limited space and because their reduced
flying capacity allows experiments under controlled laboratory con­
ditions .
We wish to point out here, that human society and an ant colony are
completely different in their structural organization. But as Edward
O. Wilson (1971) mentioned in his prospect for an "unified sociobiology", there are some functional similarities between them. Both
societies are characterized by an extensive division of labour, which
needs a good coordination of activities. The members of cooperative
groups have to communicate among one another, using signals percepti­
ble by the existing sensory channels: Man has his unique language
with its enormous potential and plasticity, transmitted through gen­
erations by learning. In contrast, the communication system of ants
is genetically fixed and highly stereotyped.
The social behaviour of ants is well known and was summarized e.g.
by Sudd (1967), Wilson (1971) and Dumpert (1978). However, pharmacol­
ogical experiments on the behaviour of ants are scarce. Kostowski and
his group (1965-1975) investigated the actions of many substances on
the aggressive behaviour of ants against beetles.
We examined:
(1) the behavioural and toxic effects of lysergic acid diethylamidetartrate (LSD) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in individual
ants (Frischknecht and Waser, 1978b).
(2) We investigated the uptake of LSD and THC into the ants' brain
(Frischknecht and Waser, 1978a).
(3) We established their effects on the social behaviour of ants,
which will be mainly discussed today. (Frischknecht and Waser, 1980)
Ants
All our investigations were done with ants of the species Formica
pratensis Retz. They were taken out of a colony 13 km south-east
from Zurich and kept in a formicar equipped with their genuine
nesting material. During this period in our laboratory, we made
sugar-water (250 mg/ml sucrose) available to them.
Drugs: Application and Dosage
In all our experiments reported here, the drugs were administered
to the ants orally in the food.
First, we evaluated in individual ants the suitable drug concentra­
tions to be used in the food,according to the toxicities.LSD was mixed
with sugar-water containing 250 mg/ml sucrose. A drug concentration
of 100 /ug/ml sugar-water seemed to be reasonable. A single uptake of
this food caused typical LSD-effects in a good many ants. These ants
often displayed fumbling movements with their forelegs in the air at
each step. The head was kept elevated and the antennae were stretched
out and agitated. In addition these ants often avoided the approach
or touch with a probe instead of showing threat-posture and seizing.
These drug effects eventually disappeared in almost all ants. Even in
ants having free access to this diet for 10 days, the mortality rate
was increased only slightly. Because of the low water solubility of
THC, we suspended this drug in sugar-water containing 10 vol.% of

Appendix

361

Tween-80 as an emulsifier.The uptake of a solution containing 1 mg/ml
THC was very good. But subsequently, no distinct changes in the indi­
vidual behaviour of ants could be observed, not even after repeated
drug administrations. Because of increasing difficulties to dissolve
the drug in higher concentrations, we used 1 mg/ml THC for further
experiments.
Drug Levels in Ant Brains
A fundamental question for a centrally acting drug is its rate of up­
take into the brain and the accumulation in the ceritral nervous
system. These mechanisms have not been examined before in ants. Simi­
lar investigations in other species, e.g. small laboratory mammals
are not compatible, because of the morphological differences in the
anatomy of the alimentary tract and of the blood-brain barrier.
At increasing time intervals from a single feeding with (3H)LSD, or
( n)THC, ants were taken for analysis of incorporated radioactivity.
The brains were dissected and their radioactive content evaluated by
means of a liquid scintillation counter. To obtain comparable results,
all values were normalized to one brain and a drug concentration of
100yug/ml food. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 1.
The (^H)LSD content in the brain increased gradually during 12 hr
after feeding to about 150 pg/brain. After 42 hr however, the drug
content decreased to 1/3 of its maximum value. After feeding with
( H)THC, the drug content in the brain increased steeply during
24 hr. The maxima, corresponding to about 800 pg THC per brain were
not reached before 24 - 48 hr. Subsequently, the drug content de­
creased to about 1/3 only after 6 days.

THC is taken up by the nervous system of ants to a larger extent than
LSD and remains there for a longer time. This finding corresponds
with results in mammals. The THC-molecules are lipophilic and cross
the blood-brain barrier much more easily than LSD-molecules with
their polar carboxy- and amino-groups. But it should be noted, that
a strikingly long time is required for the peak levels of drug con­
centration in the ant's brain to be reached. This might be connected
to some pecularities of the ants intestinal tract. .
Acute Drug Effects on Interactions of Ants
Taking account of these findings, we started our investigations on
the social behaviour of ants under the influence of LSD and THC.In a
first series of experiments,we always introduced one drug-or controlfed ant to ten hungry nestmates and noted its interactions during
10 min. The following patterns of social behaviour were observed:
aggressive behaviour (threat, seizing and biting), social grooming,
food-sharing behaviour (frequency and duration) and the number of
social interactions per encounter. At the beginning, we used sugarwater alone and sugar-water containing 100 ¿ig/ml LSD. At intervals of
2, 9, 18, 24 and 48 hr from feeding, always 10 drug and 10 control
experiments were done.
After introducing a control-fed ant to ten hungry nestmates,
aggressive elements were scarce and limited to the first encounters.
Soon the test ants calmed and began to share food among the hungry
nestmates. In experiments up to 24 hr after feeding, each food­
sharing behaviour took generally more than 10 sec. Subsequently, the
acceptors often groomed the donors. Later on, many acceptors pro­
ceeded in secondary food-sharing behaviour as donors.

Appendix

Table 1 shows the effects of feeding the introduced test ant with sug­
ar-water containing 100 pg/ml LSD, compared to sugar-water alone, on
their social interactions with hungry nestmates: 2 hr after drug in­
take, food-sharing behaviour of short duration was increased. At 9,18
and 24 hr after drug feeding, the ants often moved irritatedly and
showed the typical LSD-effects in locomotion mentioned before. In
addition, these ants often ceased, or even avoided social touchings.
This resulted at 18 and 24 hr after drug feeding in a decrease of
food-sharing behaviour lasting more than 10 sec.Likewise the duration
of food-sharing behaviour and the number of interactions per meeting
were diminished at 9,18 and 24 hr after drug intake. 48 hr after LSDfeeding, the drug effects faded, showing just a slightly decreased
number of interactions per meeting.
The period of most intense drug effects (9-24 hr after LSD-feeding)
coincided with the period of highest LSD-content in the brain. The
predominant alterations in social behaviour of worker ants included
a diminished food-flow among nestmates and a reduced number of inter­
actions per meeting. Aggressive behaviour towards nestmates was not
changed. In an other series of experiments, LSD-fed ants likewise
adopted queens from their own nest, from which they were isolated
2-3 months ago. At 9, 24 and 48 hr after intake of food containing
100 pg/ml LSD, the adoptions were even less dramatic compared to the
corresponding controls. This point contrasts with findings of Floru,
Ishay and Gitter (1969) in hornets, where LSD in a concentration of
10 ¿ig/ml glucose solution not only impaired locomotion and decreased
social activities, but also increased aggression towards members of
the same colony and towards foreign wasps. Kostowski, Wysokowski and
Tarchalska (1972), however, after injecting LSD (30 ^g/'g) into the
abdominal cavity of ants, couldn't find any significant changes in
intraspecific aggression, whereas attacks towards beetles were de­
creased at 1 and 3 hr following drug administration.
In an analogous series of experiments, where one fed worker ant was
added to 10 hungry nestmates, we used THC in a concentration of
1 mg/ml, and the solvent, sugar-water with 10 vol.% of Tween-80 as a
control. The occurrence of aggressive elements, social grooming,
food-sharing behaviour, and the number of interactions per meeting
were not altered at 2, 9, 24 and 48 hr after a single feeding with
THC, compared to their corresponding controls. Likewise, at 2, 9,
24 and 48 hr after intake of food containing 1 mg/ml THC*all
adoptions of queens in groups of worker ants were successful.
Acute Drug Effects on Group Formation
In a next series of experiments, we investigated the distribution and
group formation of ants in bipartite formicars, holding 50 worker
ants in either half. The ants in one compartment had free access to
control food (i.e. sugar-water, or sugar-water with 10 vol.% Tween)
for 1 hr, whereas those in the other half were fed with drugged food
containing 100 ^g/ml LSD, or 1 mg/ml THC. At 2, 9, 24 and 48 hr after
food intake, photographs were taken. To evaluate the localization of
ants, either compartment was subdivided into 16 squares.
With all 4 food qualities the ants preferred the 4 corner-squares
compared to the 4 centre-squares. Significant differences between
control- and drug-compartments were rare: 2 hr after THC intake the
gathering of ants in the corner-squares was increased compared to
the controls, and 9 hr after LSD-feeding the accumulation of ants in
the centre-squares was lower than with sugar-water. The mean number
of neighbours in the same square decreased from 9 - 24 hr after LSDintake and at 48 hr it was reduced compared to the sugar-water
controls. Altogether LSD diminished the tendency of group formation
1 and 2 days following drug intake, whereas THC had little influence
on the distribution of worker ants in a formicar.
*
LSD is 4 to 500 times more potent a psychotomimetic than THC. The
dose of the later drug administered in these experiments was only 10 times
larger than that of LSD.

Effects of multiple Drug Application to large Groups of Ants
Our next experiments concerned multiple drug application to large
groups of ants, consisting of several hundreds of worker ants and
a few queens. These investigations were done in a special arrangement
(Fig. 2), where the nest was spatially separated from the feeding
place in the excursion area.Between these compartments two connecting
tubes existed. Because of their construction (wide entrances late­
rally and narrow exits at the cover) a well functioning one way
traffieflow took place. Photocells were fitted immediately before
the exits to count ants interrupting the light beam. Repeated
readings from the counters yielded activity diagrams between nest
and excursion area and vice versa.

FOR

ACTIVITY-RECORDINGS BETWEEN NEST AND FEEDING PLACE

In a first experiment (Fig. 3), during period I of 4 weeks, the ants
had free access to sugar-water with 10 vol.% of Tween-80. Then, du­
ring period II of 3 weeks, the food contained 1 mg/ml THC in addition,
and during period III of 4 weeks,the ants were fed again with control
solution. Fresh food was supplied every morning at 9 o'clock, except
for weekends. Observations of behaviour and activity measurements
were obtained from 10 and 15 days of each test-period respectively.

The daily activity back to the nest from 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. was signifi­
cantly increased during drug feeding, compared to the preceding and
succeeding control periods (Fig. 3). Similar differences were found
from readings on the photocell between nest and feeding place. The
diagram above illustrates the diurnal activity of ants obtained by
hourly readings from the counter of the photocell between the ex­
cursion area and the nest. To compare activities during controlperiod I and III and during drug feeding (II) , the total activity

from 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. was taken as 100% and the relative activities
per hour are shown. During either control period I and III, the rel­
ative activities/hour increased gradually from 8 o ’clock until noon.
With THC (II) a large increase of activity above control-levels was
found for 1 and 2 hours respectively following the supply of fresh
food. In the afternoon, the relative activities/hr were slightly de­
creased during drug feedings. From observations of the ants' move­
ments it became clear, that foraging workers returned very promptly
to the nest after uptake of THC-solution. However, these ants lacked
distinct behavioural impairments, and the domestic workers nursed
eggs, larvae and pupae even after a drug period of 4 weeks.

In a similar experiment (Fig. 4), during period I of 4 weeks, the
ants had free access to sugar-water. Afterwards, during period II of
2 weeks, the food contained 100 ^ug/ml LSD in addition. Behaviour and
activities were observed for 16 and 8 days respectively.

The daily total activity from 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. was not altered by
changing from sugar-water to drugged food. The distribution of the
relative activities/hr in the day-time however, showed a distinct
shift: During control feeding (I), the activity increased by steps
from 8 a.m. until noon, and in the afternoon the activity decreased.
In contrast, during LSD-feeding (II) the activity did not increase
before 11 o'clock, and no distinct decrease from maximum occurred in
the afternoon. Behavioural observations showed, that domestic workers
proceeded to care for the queens and the brood during LSD-feeding
period. Foraging workers however, in the excursion area, often
showed distinct drug effects. The locomotion of these ants exhibited
sporadic periods of unsteadiness and sometimes they displayed fum­
bling movements with their forelegs in the air at each step. For­
aging workers with extremely filled gasters in part isolated them­
selves socially and didn't return to the nest. Altogether, a distinct
gradient of LSD-effects was found from foraging to domestic worker
ants. The following reasons might account for this observation:
Domestic workers don't procure their food themselves, but receive it
by food-sharing behaviour from foraging ants. Our experiments
suggest, that LSD influenced some foraging workers to return no more

367

to the nest, and LSD decreased food-sharing behaviour among worker
ants. Either effect prevented an equal distribution of the drug
among the whole colony. Nevertheless, feeding with sugar-water con­
taining 100 ¿ag/ml LSD has detrimental effects for the entire colony.
The amount of food available to the queens, larvae and domestic
workers decreased. This deficiency has to be made good by recruiting
additional foraging workers, which is achieved only by depleting the
number of nursing ants. This shift in group population stunts an ant
colony, even if their existence is not immediately endangered.

ABSTRACT
The use of the lognormal 'distribution in the study of drugs of
dependence has been debated, with some force, particularly in connection
with alcohol and Ledermann's theory relating the incidence of alcoholism
to the mean consumption of alcohol in a population (e.g.Davies,1977). It
has also been discussed in relation to psychodynaaic theories of the
aetiology of alcoholism. The association of a particular mathematical
pattern of drug use with theories which can have f ar-reachi;ig implications
for methods of social control presents a problem) for, depending on the
attitude to such control, it can lead either to an over- or an
under-estimate of the generality of the pattern itself, and of its
mathematical meaning.This paper is intended to provide a general context,
in which the pattern of drug use may be allowed to speak for itself.

KEYWORDS
Lognormal distribution, dispersion, alcohol, cannabis,
illicit drugs

Lognormality is an old concept in pharmacology and bioassay. It
underlies the procedure of probit analysis and bioassay that, following
Trevan's work, was introduced by Gaddum and Bliss. It was found that the
relation between the dose of a drug and the proportion of a population
responding to it that reached some defined endpoint was well described on
the basis that it was not sensitivity but the logarithm of the sensitivity
that was normally distributed. (A similar fit could often be obtained,
using the response of a tissue to a drug; and this contributed to the
widespread use of log-dose response curves). This "lognormal" relationship
meant that, with a suitable transformation of the response measure (the
probit transformation) the presence of a lognormal distribution could be
readily recognised by th-e linearity of a log-probit plot. Figure 1, from
Wilson and Schild's textbook of 1961, illustrates the construction of such
a plot in the context of clinical pharmacology. To apply it to patterns of
drug use, it is only necessary that data are available over the whole range
of rates of drug use for the whole of the population studied, even if the
subdivisions are few. In the first step, the construction of a cumulative
distribution, there is a choice whether to "cumulate* to the left or to the
right. In the present case, there is interest in the proportion of the
population with a given rate of drug use or higher, so that we wish to
examine the right-hand tail of the distribution and cumulate to the
left.Figure 2 (from Paton,1975) shows a number of such plots, for alcohol,
cannabis, illegal drugs as a group, tobacco, tranqui11izers, opiates, and
"narcotics", from a range of countries, (France, Canada, U.S.A., and
England),and a range of age-groups (schoolchildren, undergraduates, service
personnel, and general public).

Here the data are McueulatedN to the right. For analysis of drug use,
cumulation to the left shorns the proportion of high users.
Ledereann, probably the first to use this approach in considering the
use of a drug, used a sore complicated procedure. On the basis that there
is a dose of alcohol that Mill kill virtually any subject, he thought it
necessary to introduce a particular constraint on the plot, namely that the
line should pass through a particular point at the right-hand extreme of
the plot. This in fact resulted in some rather poor fits, and laid him
open to the charge of arbitrariness in allocating a particular lethality to
a particular dose. The simple plot outlined above, or a simple probit
analysis, avoids this difficulty, but it is also vulnerable! for it
suggests that there Mill be a measurable incidence of drug consumption,
hoMever high a level of consumption is proposed. The problem, hoNever, is
essentially that of extrapolation. It is not necessary to extrapolate!
alternatively procedures may be follomed appropriate for a "truncated"
distribution (v. Aitchison and BroMn,1969).

Inspection of Figure 2,with other such data, suggests that there are
two common patterns of drug use: that shown by alcohol, and that shown by
other drugs. This is best characterised in terms of the dispersion of the
log-normal distribution, i.e. its standard deviation. This will, of
course, be in logarithmic units. That implies, for instance, that if one
wishes to express the standard deviation directly in terms of drug use (not
the logarithm of it) then its value gives a dose-ratio (that which, applied
either side of the median rate of drug use, includes about two-thirds of
the population). In figure 2, therefore, are also shown the slopes
corresponding to standard deviations of 3x and 50x. More data of this type
are needed, but from the surveys available (including those cited in Paton,
1975 and Evans et.al,1974) the following have been calculated:
(a)
for alcohol, the values of the s.d. lay between 0.558 and 1.520:
mean =1.186. The standard deviation of the s.d. was 0.298,and
s.e.m.(n* 12)*0.086.
(b)
for cannabis consumption(including hashish), values of the s.d. lay
between 2.42 and 6.12: mean*4.293;the standard deviation of the s.d. was
1.302;s.e.m. (n * 13)=0.361.
(c)
for other drugs generally, there were insufficient data for
separate analysis; but for "glue", barbiturates, opiates, stimulants,
tranquillizers, LSD, and tobacco, the values of the s.d. fell between 2.56
and 5.28.
It must be remembered that logarithmic transformations generally tend
to minimise non-1inearities) yet the consistency of the two patterns is
notable, and clearly they are significantly different. Some care is
needed, however, in interpretation. Question may also be raised about the
reliability of survey data; these usually provide users' self-reported drug
consumption, which is known to be unreliable. It must be noted, however,
that some of Ledermann's data showing the typical pattern were, not
reported use, but alcohol blood-levels.
The question of special proneness to drug use. Experience of the fully
developed alcoholic or drug addict makes it easy to postulate a special
group of addiction-prone personalities. But it is equally the case that
there has been a consistent failure to find any physical or psychological
characteristic usefully predictive of addiction before it has developed.
Once developed, one may point to a special group of apparently vulnerable
individuals,but that vulnerability looks to be a result of drug use, not a
cause. The pattern of lognormality of drug use is consonant with this; for
if there were a separate substantial group, more liable than the norm to
take some drug, then there would be a discontinuity in the plot. Its
linearity suggests,on the contrary, that there is a continuous spectrum of
drug use; and if there is such a thing as predisposition to it, then that,
too, is smoothly distributed.
It was mentioned above that logarithmic transformations tend to minimise
non-linearities; so it should be noticed that if there were, for instance,
four or five distinguishable groups in the general population, each with
its own pattern of use, then an approximation to a simple linearity could
well be observed; for the distribution of the sum of a number of normal
distributions would not be easy to distinguish by these methods from
normality. The practical issue, however, is probably that of whether there
is a single substantial identifiable group, needing help. It seems that
none can at present be recognized; and a prudent conclusion might be,
“There, but for the grace of God, go we all"'

The possibility of predicting rates of use from wean use, Ledermann s hope
NAS that accurate estimates of alcoholism could be deduced from general
figures of consumption, facilitating social control. But it is sufficiently
clear from Ledermann s own data for alcohol, and from the data for other
drug use, that even if the pattern is consistent, there is sufficient
variation in the dispersion parameter to make the limits of error around
any estimate of alcoholism rates for a given mean or median rate of alcohol
consumption far too wide to be usable.The special difficulty is that fairly
small (say 207.) changes in dispersion parameter can lead to substantial
(c.lOOX) changes in size of the right-hand tail.
At the same time, the consistency of the patterns does support the
general view, that the higher the average rate of use, the higher will be
the incidence of over-usejand that to avoid an unacceptable burden of
alcoholism or drug abuse requires society as a whole to be temperate. The
pattern is too common to allow one to set aside any link between general
and individual use, even if that link cannot be quantified for legislation.
Loqnormality as a pointer to mechanisms of dependence.lt is not easy to
resist building models of the addicting process, when the linear log-normal
plot is encountered; and theories of infection, spread, or "contagion“ can
readily be formulated. But the normal distribution has a rather general
ongin;any quantity that is formed as the resultant of a number of small,
independent, random forces, will tend to fluctuate according to the normal
distribution. The pattern of distribution is evidence, not of mechanism,
but that the determinants of drug use are numerous; i.e. that drug
consumption is "multifactorial". That does not falsify any aetiological
theory that also predicts lognormality; it merely makes it redundant.
The fact that the distribution is logarithmic implies that the
variations that are occurring are not "arithmetical'* but "proportionate".
This seems reasonable to experience; for to a subject used to taking, say,
one glass of sherry a week, a second glass would represent a significant
change, yet such an increment would be negligible to a "bottle a day" man.
It appears that drug use follows the patterns of a good deal of
psychophysical data, as well as those of pharmacology generally.
The origin and significance of the differences in dispersions between
drugs.The variability in rate of use of a drug could be envisaged as
arising from many causes:- variations in income, in social milieu, in
sensitivity to the drug, and from the dose-response relation of the drug
itself. Further if a high degree of tolerance can develop, that could be a
major factor; equally, if there were a wide span between the dose producing
the first detectable effect and that producing the highest (but still
tolerable) intensity of action, dispersion would be increased. Variations
in metabolism would be another factor. It is not easy to see any very
cogent reason for the difference between alcohol and other drugs in any of
these directions, although it may be that the degree of tolerance achieved
in ordinary use is rather higher with cannabis,op 1 ates,and tobacco than is
obtained with alcohol.
The principal implication of the more gradual slope with cannabis and
other drugs, is that, for a given mean rate of use, there is a higher
proportion of users at high rates.lt could be argued that this brings in a
greater danger of adverse secondary effects, as distinct from any
consequences of the primary action of the drug .

Strategies for the control of over-use.A solution that light appeal to all
parties Mould be achieved if it Mere possible deliberately to narroM the
dispersion of drug-use, i.e. sake the plot steeper; for that Mould reduce
the incidence of heavy users Mhile possibly alloMing the same mean level of
consumption. For the case of alcohol, that eight appeal to tax-hungry
governments. But,in general, success on such lines looks difficult to
achieve. In Figure 2, there are a variety of rates of use, varying by a
factor of more than 100 for a given proportion of the population. Yet the
slope remains similar, Mith no consistent change. It is interesting to
examine examples from another lognormal distribution-that of incomes, in
Aitchison and Brown's monograph (1969). Figure 3 shows the consistency of
the slope (considerable but not perfect) over a range of occupations; and

Figure 3. An example of a lognormal distribution is that of income. The
pattern is consistent for various income levels. (From Aitchison fc
Brown,1969).
Figure 4 shows the consistency at the national level in the U.S.A. over
time.

Figure 4. The lognoreel pattern of distribution of incoee is consistent
over tiee. (Froe Aitchison fc Brown, 1969)
On the other hand, as noted above, quite seall changes in dispersion
can have a considerable effect on the proportion of high users} so perhaps
there is soae scope for eodulating use in this direction. The implications
of the two possible approaches, changing the aean consumption or changing
the dispersion, have not been studied fully, particularly as regards what
it would imply for other regions of the distribution} and we are almost
entirely lacking in specific knowledge of how selective change could be
brought about.
CONCLUSION
The lognormal distribution appears to characterise the pattern of use
of a wide range of drugs in a remarkably compact way. Lognormality in
itself says little about the causes of drug use and abuse} but the
difference in the pattern for alcohol from that for other drugs is
suggestive, and analysis on these lines defines two main approaches.
Further analysis and surveys to clarify how far the pattern of use can be
modulated would be of value.

TH E TIM ES, FRIDAY JU LY 24, 1992*1

The signatories to this petition call upon the Home Secretary to recognise
that the overwhelming weight of evidence demonstrates that the
prohibition of cannabis has promoted criminality, conflict and more harm
to the individual and society than its use ever has. On behalf of the citizen
and the community we therefore call on him to introduce a programme of
reform of the law which will include:
1. The abolition of the possession of cannabis as a criminal offence.
2. A thorough review to examine appropriate measures for the
establishment of legal and properly regulated sources for the supply
of cannabis.
