1. Introduction 
a b s t r a c t 
The present study describes a simple, efficient and one step regeneration system for rapid shoot prolifer ation and in vitro rooting of Cannabis sativa nodal explants using meta-topolin (mT), an aromatic natural cytokinin. The best response in terms of explants producing maximum number of shoots with maximum shootlength and percent explants producing shoots was recorded on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2  M mT. Shoots multiplied on the same medium for two sub-cultures were able to induce healthy roots within 4–6 weeks. A separate medium containing auxin was not required for root induction. Regenerated plantlets were successfully acclimatized and hardened off in the climatic con trolled grow room with 100% survival rate. Genetic fidelity of in vitro propagated plants was tested using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Our results show that all the ISSR profiles from in vitro propagated plants were monomorphic and comparable to that of the mother plant, thereby confirm ing the genetic fidelity. Qualitatively and quantitatively, cannabinoid profiles and the content, using gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC–FID), in mother plant and in vitro propagated plants were found to be similar to each other. Furthermore, regenerated plants were eco-physiologically and func tionally comparable to that of the mother plant. The maximized regeneration protocol using mT is thus effective and safe for large scale production of true to type C. sativa plants.

Cannabis is generally dioceous and occasionally a her 
marphodite, wind pollinated plant. For the production of 
Cannabis sativa L. a member of family Cannabaceae, is a valu able plant with both fiber and medicinal potential (Pertwee, 2014). Among 104 cannabinoids isolated from the plant till date (ElSohly and Gul, 2014), the major biologically active compounds are  9 tetrahydrocannabinol ( 9-THC, known for psycho-activity) and cannabidiol (CBD, a non- psychoactive compound with the potential for the treatment of epileptic seizures in children). Other major cannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabigerol(CBG) and cannabinol(CBN).

cannabinoids (or phytocannabinoids) female plants are preferred over male plants for several reasons; firstly, in comparison to male plants, female plants produce higher amount of cannabinoids; sec ondly, being highly wind pollinated, in presence of males, female plants produce lots of seeds at maturity whereas, seed free plants (sinsemilla, a Spanish word) are preferred to producehigher yield of secondary metabolites and thirdly, if several cannabis varieties are being grown together, cross pollination among the varieties would affect the quality (chemical profile) of the final product. To avoid these situations, removing male plants as they appear, screening of female clones for higher metabolite content and,their conservation and multiplication using biotechnological tools is a suitable way to ensure the consistency in chemical profile of a cannabis crop for the pharmaceutical interest.

In vitro propagation of plants can be influenced by a vari ety of factors that are categorized either as environmental or hormonal/plant growth regulators (PGRs). As a vital chemical component, PGRs regulate various physiological and develop mental processes during the micropropagation (George et al., 2008). There is a continuous effort aimed to identify new com pounds with the ability to stimulate better growth, and to alleviate in vitro-induced physiological disorders (Tarkowska et al., 2003). The recent biotechnological advances in the field of phytohor mones have significantly facilitated the search for new compounds (Strnad, 1997; Tarkowski et al., 2010). Thus, a new group of aro matic cytokines commonly referred as topolins has been identified (Strnad, 1997). Meta-topolin {6-(3-hydroxylbenzylamino) purine}, first isolated from poplar leaves, is an aromatic cytokinin, differing from isoprenoid cytokinins, such as zeatin and 2-iP, in its bio chemistry and biological activity (Strnad, 1997). Topolinshave been demonstrated to enhance shoot proliferation, maintain histogenic stability, improve rooting efficiency and alleviate various phys iological disorders in micropropagation (Aremu et al., 2012a,b). In C. sativa, reports have been available on the shoot regenera tion, proliferation and in few cases root formation using various growth regulators (Loh et al., 1983; Richez-Dumanois et al., 1986; Mandolino and Ranalli, 1999; Slusarkiewicz-Jarzina et al., 2005; Bing et al., 2007; Fisse et al., 1981; Feeney and Punja, 2003; Lata et al., 2009a,b, 2010). In the present communication, we report an efficient regeneration protocol for C. sativa using novel aromatic cytokinin, meta-topolin. Furthermore, the performance of in vitro propagated and hardened plants were evaluated and compared to that of mother plant based upon ecophysiology, photosynthetic pigment content, genetic integrity using ISSR markers and phyto cannabinoids content using GC–FID. 
2. Material and methods 
A step by step schematic diagram of experimental design for one step in vitro propagation of C. sativa is shown in Fig. 1. 
2.1. Plant material 
Plants of C. sativa were grown from seeds of a high THC yielding Mexican variety in a climatic controlled indoor cultivation facility at Coy–Waller laboratory, School of Pharmacy, University of Mis sissippi. On flowering, male plants were removed and vegetatively propagated cuttings of selected (based on chemical profile) elite female plants were used for study. This was achieved by a sys tematic screening process. After a desirable growth, cuttings from seedlings were made at vegetative growth stage. Seedlings were than subjected 12 h photoperiod for flowering till maturity while maintaining cuttings at the vegetative stage under the 18 h pho toperiod. On flowering, male plants and their related vegetative cuttings were removed. Samples of flowering female plants were collected and analyzed for their THC concentration using GC/FID. Based on chemical analysis, the elite, highest THC yielding female plant was identified and its related vegetative cuttings were used as high yielding elite ‘mother plants’ for the current study. 
Nodal segments containing axillary buds from selected mother plants were used as an explant for initiation of shoot cultures. Explants were surface-disinfected using 0.5% NaOCl (15% v/v bleach) and 0.1% Tween 20 for 20 min. and washed in sterile dis tilled water three times for 5 min each, prior to inoculation on the culture medium. 
2.2. Shoot regeneration, elongation and rooting 
In our previous study, we have reported the effect of differ ent growth hormones on shoot formation and rooting of C. sativa. 
Different concentrations of BA, Kn, TDZ and GA3 were tested for shoot formation, and IAA, IBA and NAA for rooting. Out of all the growth regulators, best shoot formation were obtained in MS + TDZ whereas, the best rooting were obtained in ½MS + IBA (Lata et al., 2009a,b). Therefore, in the present study,the effect of different con centrations of TDZ (0.05, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00 and 5.00  M) with MS medium and IBA (0.05, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00 and 5.00  M) with ½MS were tested and compared with similar con centrations (ranging from0.05  Mto 5.0  M) ofmeta-topolin(mT). 
Disinfected explants were inoculated on Murashige and Skoog’s medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) containing 3% (w/v) sucrose, 0.8% (w/v) type B agar (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and 500 mg L−1 activated charcoal supplemented with various concentrations of MS + thidiazuron (TDZ, a cytokinin) and ½ MS + Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA, an auxin) and compared with MS + mT ranging from 0.05 to 5.0  M adjusted to pH 5.7. Ster ile medium was dispensed (25 ml) in glass culture vessels (4-cm diameter × 9.5-cm height) with magenta B caps. 
All cultures were incubated at 25 ± 2 ◦C with 16-h photoperiod under fluorescent light with a photon flux of ∼52  mol m−2 s−1. All the experiments were repeated three times with ten explants, with one explant per jar. The parameters evaluated were the average number of shoots per explant, average shoot length, percentage of explants producing shoots, average number of roots per explant, average root length, and percentage of explants producing rooted plantlets. 
2.3. Acclimatization and ex-vitro propagation 
Well-rooted plants were carefully taken out of the medium, washed thoroughly in running tap water to remove all traces of medium attached to the roots. These plants were pre-incubated in coco natural growth medium (Canna Continental, Los Angeles, CA) in thermocol cups for 10 days before transferring in sterile potting mix-fertilome (Canna Continental) in large pots. All these plantlets were kept under controlled environmental conditions (light, ∼700  mmol m−2 s−1 with 16-h photoperiod, temperature 25–30 ◦C and relative humidity ∼60%)in an indoor cultivation facil ity. Mother plants and well acclimatized tissue culture raised plants were transferred ex vitro for further cultivation. 
2.4. Comparison of tissue culture raised plants with mother plants 
2.4.1. Eco-physiology 
Plants regenerated from tissue culture and their mother plant were compared for photosynthetic characteristics at peak veg etative stage. Measurements were carried out on three upper undamaged, fully expanded and healthy leaves of five randomly selected in vitro propagated plants (IVP) and mother plant (MP) using a climatic controlled portable photosynthesis system (Model LI-6400; LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). Throughout the experi ment, cuvette temperature and lightlevel were maintained at 25 ◦C and 1600  mol m−2 s−1 photon flux densities (PPFD), respectively, since these conditions were found optimum for the photosynthe sis and growth of C. sativa following our previous studies (Chandra et al., 2008). Four gas exchange parameters viz. photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpirational water loss (E), stomatal conductance (gCO2) and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) were measured simulta neously at steady state condition. Water use efficiency (WUE) of plants was calculated as a ratio of the rate of photosynthesis (Pn) and transpiration (E). 
2.4.2. Pigments content 
Leaves used for the photosynthetic gas exchange measure ments were later harvested for the determination of pigments content. Chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b) and carotenoid

comprising 0.1  M each primer, 1 unit of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, USA), 200  M of each dNTP (Promega Cor poration, USA), 1.5 mM of MgCl2, 20 ng of template DNA, and 1 × PCR buffer. Amplifications were carried out in heated lid M&J Research Gradient Cycler PTC-225 programmed at 94 ◦C for 3 min for initial denaturation, followed by 94 ◦C for 30 s, 50 ◦C for 30 s and 72 ◦C for 3 min for 45 cycles followed by a final step of extension at 72 ◦C for 7 min. After amplification, each PCR reaction was ana lyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% TAE (Tris-Acetate-EDTA) agarose gel and visualized under UV light. The sizes of the PCR products were compared to the molecular size standard 1 kb plus DNA lad der (Invitrogen, USA). Gels were also scanned with the Bio-Rad Gel Imaging System and ana-lyzed using Quantity One analysis soft ware version 4.3.0 (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., USA). 
Only clear and well-marked bands in the size ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 kb were scored as being present or absent for ISSR markers. Data for DNA band in each micropropagated and mother plant were scored in binary character matrices as 1 and 0 being present and absent, respectively. 
2.4.4. Cannabinoids profile and content 
Biomass samples taken from fully matured mother plant (n = 3) and tissue culture raised plants (n = 9) were compared for cannabinoids profile and content. Triplicate of each sample were used for the analysis of six major cannabinoids ( 9- tetrahydrocannabinol,  9-THC; tetrahydrocannabivarin, THCV; cannabidiol, CBD; cannabichromene, CBC; cannabigerol, CBG and cannabinol, CBN) using GC-FID following the method described by Ross et al. (1996) and ElSohly et al. (2000). 
2.5. Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis of the data was done by agricolae module using statistical software “R” version 2.2.1 (2005). 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. In vitro regeneration using meta-topolin 
The main aim of this work was to refine the existing protocol for the mass propagation of C. sativa. In our previous reports, we have reported two separate growth regulators for in vitro shoot formation (TDZ, 0.5  M) and rooting (IBA 2.5  M) in C. sativa (Lata et al., 2009a,b, 2010). However, in the present study, a simple one step protocol was established using MS with an aromatic cytokinin meta-topolin m T (Fig. 2). Table 1 shows the effects of different growth regulators used for shoot and root growth. Overall,the high est average number of shoots (13.44 ± 1.38 cm) was obtained in the treatment with MS + 2.0  M m T with maximum shoot length (11.44 ± 0.80 cm). All the explants (100%) inoculated in vitro with 2.0  M m T were capable of producing shoots (Table 1). In TDZ, on the other hand, of the different concentrations tested, high est average number of shoots (11.89 ± 0.93 cm) was obtained in MS + 0.5  M TDZ with average shoot length of 7.35 ± 0.58 cm (sim ilar to our previous report, Lata et al., 2009a,b). The average number of shoot production and shoot length was higher using mT as com paredto TDZ (Table 1). Similar to our results,the superiority ofusing aromatic cytokinin meta-topolin for shoot proliferation has been emphasized been by many researchers (Roels et al., 2005; Wojtania et al., 2004; Bairu et al., 2007, 2009Amoo et al., 2012). (Staden et al., 2010) have emphasized the role of meta-topolin in the production of morphogenically competent cells. Till date, there is no report on the use oftopolins in the micropropagation of Cannabaceae species. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on application of mT on C. sativa. 
Due to the vigorous growth in MS + mT medium (especially mT concentration ranging from 1  M to 4  M) plants were subcultured on the same fresh medium after 3 weeks. Roots started appearing within 3–4 weeks and fully developed healthy roots were formed by 6 weeks in culture. A separate medium for rootinitiation was not needed. Of various concentrations of mT tested, the best concen tration for rooting was MS medium supplemented with 2.0  M mT (Table 1). About 96% ofthe regenerated shoots were able to develop roots with an average of 14 roots per shoot and 18.68 ± 1.07 cm shoot length, within 4 weeks of transfer to fresh (MS + 2.0  M mT) medium. Roots induced at this concentration were thicker, robust and with lot of branches. Meta topolin concentrations higher than 4  M were inhibitory to rooting. Although, auxin alone has been a growth regulator for rooting (Gaspar et al., 1996), and specifically IBA has been used in plant propagation because of its efficacy in the stimulation of adventitious roots (Staden et al., 2010), however,the superiority of mT as compared to IBA was remarkably observed in the present study, especially at the lower concentrations. Of differ ent concentrations of IBA tested, the best rooting (about 5 roots per shoot with an average of 5.38 ± 0.33 cm root length) was observed in ½ MS + 3  M IBA. These results are consistent to those reported in our previous report (Lata et al., 2009a,b). However, the number of roots produced and average root length was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in MS + 2  M mT as compared to those in ½MS + 3  M IBA (Table 1). Furthermore, plants produced with mT rooted much bet ter during the acclimatization after transfer to soil in the indoor climate controlled growing facility than shoots produced with TDZ. Similar effects of mT have been observed byWerbrouck et al.(1996) in Spathiphyllum florigbundum . Working on Prunus (Prunus domes tica L. and Prunus insititia × domestica), Gentile et al. (2014) have reported a higher rooting percentage, root number and length in mT as compared to BA. Similarly, Westhuizen (2014) working on Eucalyptus species reported less vitrified shoots and better in vitro rooting in 0.2 mg L−1 meta topolin as compared to other concentra tion of cytokinins tested. In the present study, plantlets regenerated in MS supplemented with 2.0  M mT medium were successfully acclimatized and hardened off with 100% survival rate. 
3.2. Comparison of in vitro propagated plants with mother plant 
3.2.1. Photosynthetic characteristics and pigment content Acomparisonofphotosynthetic characteristics betweenmother plant (MP) and in vitro propagated plants (IVP) are shown in Fig. 3. Photosynthesis, rate of transpiration and consequently, water use efficiency play an important role in the logistics of survival, growth and development of plants. Most of the dry matter in live plants is reported to be derived from photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (Zelitch, 1975). Variations in photosynthesis in different plants species reflects their ability to grow and survive at a particu lar environmental condition. In the present study, gas and water vapour exchange parameters are used as a tool to compare phys iological functioning of mother and tissue culture raised plants. In general, average Pn (MP = 22.17 and IVP = 23.17  mol m−2 s−1), gCO2 (MP = 207.79 and IVP = 213.82 mmol m−2 s−1) and WUE (MP = 3.65 and IVP = 4.05) were slightly higher and, aver age E (MP = 6.19, IVP = 5.74 mmol m−2 s−1), Ci (MP = 234.33, IVP = 232.50  mol mol−1) and Ci/Ca (MP = 0.67, IVP = 0.66) were slightly lower in tissue culture raised plants as compare to the mother plant. These differences between MP and IVP plants, how ever, were statistically insignificant (Pn = 1.23, gCO2 = 8.65, E = 0.46, Ci = 6.01, Ci/Ca = 0.04 and WUE = 0.41; data represents LSD between MP and IVP at p < 0.05). In a similar experiment Bag et al. (2000) have reported at par or slightly better performance oftissue culture raised plants than mother plant in terms of their photosynthetic characteristics and morphological parameters.

Magnitude of photosynthetic and respiratory characteristics of plants is strongly related to variations in its pigment content (Todaria, 1990). In a plant species, variation in pigments and there fore, in photosynthetic characteristics while grown in different environmental conditions reflect its adjustment to the climatic rig ors (Anjum et al., 2011). Application of cytokinins is also reported to promote photosynthesis by enhancing total Chl content (Caers and Vendrig, 1986). In a dose response study on Raphanus sativus L., Unsal et al. (2002) reported an increase in total Chl content with 
the application of mT as compared to those of control plants. In the present study, in vitro propagated plants were grown in the same soil composition and in similar environmental conditions ex vitro as the mother plant. Our result shows no statistically sig nificant difference in Chl a (LSD = 0.45, p < 0.05), Chl b (LSD = 0.21, p < 0.05), total Chl (LSD = 0.58, p < 0.05), Chl a/Chl b ratio (LSD = 0.88, p < 0.05), Car (LSD = 0.12, p < 0.05) and total Chl/Car ratio (LSD = 0.21, p < 0.05) between mother and tissue culture raised plants.

recent years, different molecular techniques (i.e., restriction frag ment length polymorphism, RFLP; Amplified fragment length polymorphism, AFLP; Inter-simple sequence repeat, ISSR; Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA, RAPD etc.) are being used to confirm genetic integrity or somaclonal variations between mother plants and clones produced through in vitro techniques (Prasad et al., 2015). Eachtechniquehas its ownadvantages over otherdepending

on the purpose (McGregor et al., 2000). ISSR markers are reported to be simple, highly polymorphic and cover all the advantages of AFLP and RAPD markers (Reddy et al., 2002; Phulwaria et al., 2015), therefore, being used to testthe genetic fidelity of micropropagated plants in general and thus used in this study. Eight ISSR primers were screened with the DNA of mother plant and nine randomly selected tissue culture raised plants. Each tested primer produced clear andscorable amplificationproducts ranging insize fromabout 155 bp with UBC 845 to 2000 bp with UBC826 with an average of 6.6 bands per primer generating monomorphic patterns across all 10 plants analyzed (Table 2). No ISSR polymorphism was detected showing genetic integrity of micropropagated plants (Fig. 5). Our results corroborate with earlier reports of genetic fidelity of micro propagated plants based on ISSR analysis of C. sativa (Lata et al., 2009a,b, 2010), Balanites aegyptiaca (Varshney and Anis, 2013), Moringa peregrine (Khateeb et al., 2013), Psidium guajava (Rai et al., 2012), Dendrocalamus strictus (Goyal et al., 2015), Alhagi mauro rum (Agarwal et al., 2014), Ceropegia evansii (Chavan et al., 2015), Salvadora oleoides (Phulwaria et al., 2015). 
3.2.3. Phytocannabinoids 
Consistency in the chemical profile and useful metabolites con tent of raw material is of utmost interest in any plant based pharmaceutics. Direct organogenesis from shoot cultures repre sents an alternative system to vegetative propagation due to its consistency in the production of secondary metabolites and 
genetically stable plants as compared to indirect organogenesis or other micropropagation methods (Chandra et al., 2010; Amoo et al., 2013). Genetic stability and secondary metabolite production, however, in micropropagated plants can be influenced by several factors such as growth environment, choice and concentration of growth regulator used during micropropagation etc. (Dornenburg and Knorr, 1995). In the present study, micropropagated plants were acclimatized and grown till maturity with mother plant in identical environmental conditions. Biomass samples of mature buds/mature flowers (since buds contain highest amount of phy tocannabinoids) of mother and micropropagated plants were compared for cannabinoids profile and content. The average level of  9-THC (7.25 ± 0.15, n = 27) in IVP plants were found to be highly comparable to each other and to that of the mother plant (7.52 ± 0.04, n = 9). Similarly, CBD, a non-psychologically active compound with high pharmacological value (MP, 0.08 ± 0.01; IVP, 0.07 ± 001; LSD = 0.02 at p < 0.05) and other cannabinoid contents (i.e. THCV, CBD, CBG and CBN) in micropropagated plants were also comparable to the mother plant. Minor differences in different cannabinoids content between mother plant and micropropagated plants were found to be statistically insignificant (p < 0.05, Table 3). These results thus suggest plants propagated through the cur rent in vitro protocol appear to be ‘normal’ and identical to each other and, to that of the mother plant in terms of useful secondary metabolite content.

4. Conclusion 
In summary, the use of mT (2.0  M) provides a one-step pro 
tocol effective in promoting adventitious shoot formation and root induction in the same medium. The maximized regeneration protocol is simple and cost effective considering the high shoot pro liferation rate, the ease of rooting, and the 100% survival frequency of acclimatized plants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the successful application of mT on in vitro propagation of C. sativa . Our results confirm the clonal fidelity of micropropa gated plants and reveal that current protocol using mT is safe for large-scale production of true-to-type C. sativa plants.
