## Gameplay Flow

### Complete Pipeline Example

#### Phase 1: Harvest
```csharp
// Player harvests plant
HarvestResult harvest = harvestManager.ProcessHarvest(plant);
// → 150g fresh material at 85% quality

// System creates batch
ProcessingBatch batch = batchManager.CreateBatchFromHarvest(harvest, geneticHash);
// → Batch_GoldenGoat_20251009_143022
// → Stage: Fresh, 150g at 85% quality, 75% moisture
```

#### Phase 2: Drying (7-14 days)
```csharp
// Player starts drying in ideal conditions
DryingConditions conditions = DryingConditions.Ideal;
// → 21°C, 50% humidity, moderate airflow, darkness

batchManager.StartDrying(batch.BatchId, conditions);

// Day 1: 75% moisture → "Drying - Monitor closely"
// Day 3: 60% moisture → "Drying well"
// Day 5: 45% moisture → "✓ Drying well"
// Day 8: 25% moisture → "Nearly done"
// Day 10: 11% moisture → "✅ Perfect - Ready to cure"

// Quality: 85% → 87% (+2% from perfect conditions)
// Weight: 150g → 39g (74% moisture loss)
```

#### Phase 3: Curing (2-8 weeks)
```csharp
// Player fills jars
CuringJarConfig jarConfig = CuringJarConfig.Ideal;
// → 75% full, 62% target humidity, burp every 24 hours

batchManager.StartCuring(batch.BatchId, jarConfig, targetWeeks: 6);

// Week 1: Burp daily
//   - Day 1: Humidity 65% → Burp → 62%
//   - Day 2: Humidity 64% → Burp → 61%
//   - Quality: 87% → 89% (+2% week 1)

// Week 3: Burp every 2 days
//   - Quality: 91% → 92.5% (+1.5% week 3)

// Week 6: Burp weekly
//   - Quality: 95% → 95.5% (+0.5% week 6)

// Final: Quality 95.5% (Premium+) - 2.0x market value
```

#### Phase 4: Market Sale
```csharp
// Generate quality report
ProcessingQualityReport report = GenerateQualityReport(batch);

// Results:
// - Final Quality: 95.5% (Premium+)
// - Quality Gain: +10.5%
// - Potency Retention: 98%
// - Terpene Retention: 95%
// - Appearance: 9.5/10
// - Aroma: 9.8/10
// - Market Value: 2.0x base price
// - Achievements: ["Perfect dry", "Extended cure", "Ideal humidity"]

// Price: $30/g base × 2.0 multiplier × 39g = $2,340 total

## Integration Points

### Harvest → Processing
```csharp
// HarvestManager completes harvest
HarvestResult harvest = harvestManager.ProcessHarvest(plant);

// ProcessingBatchManager creates batch
ProcessingBatch batch = processingBatchManager.CreateBatchFromHarvest(
    harvest,
    geneticHash: plant.GeneticFingerprint
);
```

### Processing → Inventory
```csharp
// Processing completes
ProcessingQualityReport report = GenerateQualityReport(batch);

// Move to inventory (TODO: InventorySystem integration)
inventoryManager.AddProcessedProduct(
    strainName: batch.StrainName,
    weightGrams: batch.WeightGrams,
    quality: batch.CurrentQuality,
    geneticHash: batch.GeneticHash
);
```

### Processing → Marketplace
```csharp
// Calculate market value from quality
float marketValueMultiplier = ProcessingQualityCalculator.GetMarketValueMultiplier(batch.CurrentQuality);

// Base price × quality multiplier
float basePrice = 30f; // $30/g base
float sellPrice = basePrice * marketValueMultiplier;
// Premium+ (95%): $30 × 2.0 = $60/g
// Excellent (85%): $30 × 1.4 = $42/g
// Good (75%): $30 × 1.0 = $30/g
```

## Player Experience

### Invisible Complexity (Video Game First)

**What Players See**:
```
╔════════════════════════════════════╗
║  BATCH: Golden Goat #42            ║
║  ────────────────────────────────  ║
║  Stage: Drying - Day 5/10          ║
║  Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%        ║
║  Quality: 87% ✅                   ║
║  Status: "✓ Drying well"           ║
║                                    ║
║  [Adjust Conditions]  [Details]    ║
╚════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**What's Happening Behind Scenes**:
```csharp
// Real-time calculations
float moistureLossRate = 0.065f * tempFactor * humidityFactor * airflowFactor;
batch.MoistureContent -= moistureLossRate * deltaTime;

// Risk assessment
float moldRisk = (humidity - 0.65f) * 2f + (temp - 24f) * 0.1f;
float overDryRisk = (0.08f - moisture) * 5f;

// Quality effects
float conditionQuality = conditions.GetQualityScore();
batch.CurrentQuality += (conditionQuality >= 0.9f ? 0.1f : 0f) * deltaTime;
batch.CurrentQuality -= moldRisk * 0.5f * deltaTime;
```

**Result**: Players make strategic decisions (adjust temp/humidity) based on simple feedback ("⚠️ Too humid"), while complex physics/chemistry models run invisibly.
