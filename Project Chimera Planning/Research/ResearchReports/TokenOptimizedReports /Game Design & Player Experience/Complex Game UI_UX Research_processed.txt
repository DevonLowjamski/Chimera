UI design study (PC/console) notes user-friendly complexity presentation challenges. Suggests "console-first" design for potentially better general player experience; emphasizes adaptable cross-platform UI. "Pace" (speed of in-game actions/goal achievement) is critical, underscoring need for efficient info access/interaction.
*   **MMORPGs (e.g., World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV):** UI/UX challenges: inventory management, complex skills, quest logs, social interaction. Case study: custom MMORPG UX tools show industry effort for UX enhancement. Outdated venue location tool feedback indicates iterative UI/UX design needs. Research: storytelling in MMORPG UI enhances player empathy/engagement with intricate systems. "Flow" (deep focus/enjoyment) crucial; effective UI/UX supports with clear, timely info without breaking immersion.
*   **Simulation Games (e.g., Factorio, Dwarf Fortress):** Deeply complex systems, vast data (resource management, production chains, environment). Case study: MSP Challenge (complex simulation game) UX/UI redesign emphasizes understanding UI/UX decision reasoning. Redesign heavily player observation/feedback influenced, highlighting user-centered design value.

**2.2 Principles: Effective Information Hierarchy & Intuitive Navigation**
*   Prioritize essential, readily accessible info for quick, informed decisions; avoid navigating unnecessary layers.
*   Employ clear visual cues, consistent design language (icons, colors, typography) for rapid understanding.
*   Structure menus/navigation logically, user-friendly; vital for complex games to prevent player disorientation.

**2.3 Exemplary UI/UX Design Case Studies**
*   **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild:** Intuitive, exploration-driven; UI seamlessly blends with game world, empowers natural mechanic discovery. Contrasts intricate RPG UIs.
