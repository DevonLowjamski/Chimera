Research Plan: Compile comprehensive, scientifically rigorous list of Cannabis sativa L. parameters/characteristics. Target: authoritative resource for professionals, researchers, policymakers, public. Covers: botany, chemistry, cultivation, user effects, applications, legal aspects.

2. Defining Objectives and Scope
2.1. Overall Objective: Establish systematic framework for creating comprehensive, scientifically accurate, detailed list of cannabis parameters/characteristics, integrating diverse sources for in-depth understanding.
2.2. Specific Objectives:
1.  Identify/categorize Cannabis sativa L. botanical features: morphology (height, stem/leaf structures, flower/fruit characteristics, root systems); taxonomy (species, subspecies, varieties, historical context); growth stages (germination to harvest, environmental needs); sex determination (dioecious, sex chromosomes, monoecious, hermaphroditism); trichomes (types, distribution, function in cannabinoid/terpene biosynthesis, plant defense, maturity).1
2.  Compile detailed Cannabis sativa L. chemical profile: major cannabinoids (THC, CBD); minor cannabinoids (CBG, CBN, THCV, CBDV, CBC - properties, effects); cannabinoid acids (THCA, CBDA); synthetic cannabinoids; terpenes (aromatic profiles, effects, entourage effect); flavonoids (cannflavins); other constituents (hydrocarbons, phenolics, sugars, volatile sulfur compounds).6
3.  Document critical Cannabis sativa L. cultivation conditions (optimal growth/yield): environmental requirements (soil type/pH, nutrients (macro/micro), light (photoperiod/intensity), temp/humidity ranges per stage, airflow/ventilation, water quality/irrigation); hydroponics (nutrient solution management, system types, soilless environmental control); pest/disease management (common, IPM, biological/chemical controls, sanitation).19
4.  Detail cannabis use effects on users (psychoactive/physiological): short/long-term consumption effects (THC/CBD body/mind interaction); common cannabinoid responses; potential adverse health effects; evidence-based lower-risk use guidelines.17
5.  Outline established/emerging medical applications of cannabis/components: therapeutic uses (chronic pain, CINV, MS spasticity); FDA-approved cannabis-derived drugs; minor cannabinoid research (CBG, CBN, THCV, CBDV, others for various conditions).6
6.  Summarize cannabis legal landscape (focus: key US states): medical/recreational legalization status comparison; possession/cultivation limits; specific state regulations (CA, CO, FL, TX - cultivation licensing, testing); industry standards/QC (ASTM International, FOCUS, USP roles).23
7.  Investigate existing cannabis ontologies, data standards, QC measures: ontologies (DAO, CannabisO); conceptual terminology issues; cannabis data standards development (data privacy, lab quality systems); standards/guidelines from ASTM International, FOCUS, USP (testing, cultivation, QC).145
8.  Consider lower-risk cannabis use guidelines (evidence-based): key parameters (age of initiation, THC/CBD content, use frequency/intensity, administration routes, driving post-consumption, pregnancy/breastfeeding use, risks of combining with other substances).191
9.  Identify authoritative sources/scientific community consensus on cannabis parameters/characteristics: USP publications; consensus statements/guidelines from expert panels/research initiatives; establish foundation of accepted information from credible sources.24
2.3. Scope Limitations: Primary focus: Cannabis sativa L. (predominant species). Other species/subspecies (indica, ruderalis) for comparison or unique parameters (e.g., ruderalis autoflowering). Predominantly sativa-centered list. Utilizes publicly accessible info (scientific literature, govt/regulatory docs, industry reports, standards orgs). Excludes primary lab research/original experimental data generation.

3. Identification of Key Parameters and Characteristics
3.1. Botanical Features:
3.1.1. Morphology: Cannabis sativa L. highly variable (genetics, environment).1 Plant height: 0.2m to >12m (cultivated).1 Hemp: tall, minimal branching; Drug-type: bushier (flower production).1 Stem: erect, furrows, branching, woody interior (hollow internodes).1 Leaves: compound, 3-13 leaflets (radiate from petiole end).1 Leaflet shape: lanceolate, ovoid, oblanceolate; margins serrated.1 Unique diagnostic leaf venation.261 Leaf arrangement: opposite (lower) to alternate (main stem).11 Dioecious (male/female flowers separate plants).8 Male flowers: loose panicles. Female flowers: racemes, potential for hundreds of seeds.8 Female flowers: ovaries in bracts, protruding stigmas (wind-pollinated).11 Fruit: achene (<3.8mm length), often in persistent perianth (mottled/marbled).1 Root system: adaptable, lateral branched taproot (up to 2.5m deep for subsurface moisture, soil/water dependent).1 Morphological diversity (genetic/environmental) requires detailed descriptions. Legal distinction: hemp (<0.3% THC) vs. marijuana (>0.3% THC) - critical botanical/regulatory parameter.9
3.1.2. Taxonomy/Systematics: Cannabis sativa L. (Cannabaceae family, includes Humulus lupulus L.).1 Sativa: primary species in most classifications.1 Taxonomic debate (single vs. multiple species).1 Prevailing view: C. sativa as single, highly polymorphic species, divided into subspecies/varieties (morphological, chemical, geographical).1 Common subspecies: C. sativa subsp. sativa (hemp for fiber/seed oil), C. sativa subsp. indica (drug-type, India/Afghanistan origin), C. sativa subsp. ruderalis (shorter, autoflowering, harsh climates).1 Historical debates reflect phenotypic/chemical range (natural adaptation, human selection).1 Plan: include widely accepted taxonomy, acknowledge alternatives, list distinguishing features.
3.1.3. Growth Stages: Cannabis sativa L. annual life cycle (4-10 months).61 Key stages:
- Germination: 1-10 days (moisture, oxygen, temp dependent).61
- Seedling: ~2-3 weeks (first fan leaves develop).61
- Vegetative: 3-16 weeks (rapid leaf/branch growth, cultivar/environment dependent).61
- Pre-flowering: ~1-2 weeks (signs of sexual maturity).61
- Flowering: 6-16 weeks (bud production; sativa longer than indica).61
- Harvesting: when buds mature.
Environmental needs (temp, humidity, light) vary per stage.62 Seedlings: high humidity (65-80%), warm temp (22-27°C), extended light. Flowering: lower humidity (40-50%), 12h light/12h dark cycle.62 Varying durations/needs require flexible parameter definition.
3.1.4. Sex Determination: Cannabis sativa L. predominantly dioecious (male/female plants, XY chromosome system).8 Female: XX; Male: XY.278 Sexual plasticity: monoecious varieties (single plant, both sexes).1 Hermaphroditism (both staminate/pistillate in individual flowers) less common, can occur.8 Primarily genetic control, environmental factors influence sexual expression.279 Early sex ID valuable (sinsemilla, seed propagation). Genetic markers/PCR methods for pre-flowering ID.281 List to detail: genetic basis, sexual phenotypes, early sex ID methods.
3.1.5. Trichomes: Epidermal appendages on Cannabis sativa L. surface; critical biology/chemistry roles.285 Two categories: glandular, non-glandular.285
Glandular: primary biosynthesis/storage of cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids.54 Types (morphology/size):
- Bulbous: smallest, plant-wide; potential CBGA production.11
- Capitate-sessile: larger, abundant (leaves/stems), mushroom-shaped; significant cannabinoids/terpenes.11
- Capitate-stalked: largest, most abundant (female flowers/bracts); most efficient cannabinoid/terpene producers; ideal for resin harvest.11
Non-glandular: defense (UV protection, herbivore deterrence via aroma/taste, anti-fungal).285
Density highest on female reproductive organs/bracts.1 Capitate-stalked trichome color changes with maturity (clear -> milky white -> amber) indicate harvest time.285 List to detail: trichome types, morphology, roles in chemical production, plant defense/reproduction.
