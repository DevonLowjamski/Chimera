1. Introduction: Need for Comprehensive Cannabis Parameter List
Cannabis sativa L.: increasing significance (medicine, agriculture, legal). Complex nature, diverse applications, unique properties require understanding parameters/characteristics. Rising therapeutic interest, legalization trend -> urgent need for consolidated, scientifically validated resource. Resource for: researchers (unravel potential), policymakers (informed regulations), industry (responsible practices), public (accurate info). Current cannabis info: scattered (peer-reviewed articles, governmental archives, proprietary reports, public forums). Fragmentation challenges holistic understanding. Terminology inconsistencies (cannabis, components, effects) cause confusion, impede cross-discipline communication. Nomenclature (botanical vs. vernacular) applied inconsistently, adds ambiguity. Dynamic research, evolving legal landscape -> static/dispersed knowledge insufficient. Need comprehensive, adaptable, centralized resource.

2. Defining Objectives and Scope of Cannabis Parameter List
2.1. Overall Objective
Develop ultimate, detailed, scientifically validated list of cannabis parameters/characteristics; encompassing all relevant aspects (botanical features to legal considerations).
2.2. Specific Objectives
*   Identify/categorize key botanical features: Cannabis sativa L., subspecies (sativa, indica, ruderalis), major cultivated varieties/strains.
*   Compile comprehensive chemical profile: major/minor cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, other significant constituents contributing to properties.
*   Document essential cultivation conditions: optimal growth/yield for different types; factors (environment, growth medium, nutrient requirements).
*   Summarize known physiological/psychological effects on humans: short-term/long-term impacts, influencing factors.
*   Review/synthesize current research on medical applications: various health conditions, dosage guidelines, delivery methods, FDA-approved cannabis-based medications.
*   Provide comprehensive overview of US legal landscape: federal/state regulations (medical/recreational use), decriminalization nuances, enforcement.
2.3. Scope of the List
*   Botanical Focus: Cannabis sativa L. (most studied/utilized); subspecies (sativa, indica, ruderalis); major cultivated varieties/strains (significant agricultural, medicinal, recreational interest).
*   Geographical Focus (Legal): Primarily United States (user context, complex/evolving regulations). Allows broader international comparisons if resources permit & offer value.
*   Timeframe: Information reflects current scientific understanding (recent/relevant research). Legal info up-to-date at research completion.
*   Level of Detail: High. Includes specific chemical structures (if relevant to function), quantitative cultivation data (inform best practices), evidence-based summaries (effects, medical applications, referencing key scientific findings).
2.4. Limitations
*   Focus: Cannabis sativa L. Other Cannabaceae (e.g., Humulus lupulus/hops) only for comparative purposes if directly relevant. Comprehensive family analysis beyond scope.
*   Depth of coverage (e.g., specific medical dosages) limited by current scientific evidence. List includes available guidelines/findings, acknowledges areas needing further research.
*   Legal landscape subject to frequent changes. List reflects regulations at a specific time; updates may be necessary.

3. Identification of Key Cannabis Parameters and Characteristics
3.1. Botanical Features
Foundational.
*   Taxonomy/Nomenclature: Scientific classification (Kingdom Plantae to Cannabis sativa L.), synonyms, common names (hemp, Indian hemp, marihuana, marijuana). Subspecies (sativa, indica, ruderalis), historical classifications. Epithet 'sativa' signifies cultivated nature. Family Cannabaceae (includes hops).
*   Morphology: Physical structure. Leaves (shape, size, venation, leaflets 3-13). Male/female flowers, arrangement (racemes), trichomes (crucial for cannabinoid production). Seed (size, shape, color). Stem (height 0.2-5m+, branching, structure). Root system. Sativa plants: typically tall, thin, narrow, finger-like leaves.
*   Genetics: Diploid chromosome number (2n=20). Genetic variations (subspecies, varieties). Key genes (cannabinoid/terpene production). Breeding practices (diverse strains).
*   Growth Stages: Life cycle (germination to harvesting). Duration: germination (1-10 days), seedling (2-3 weeks), vegetative (3-16 weeks), flowering (7-16 weeks). Developmental changes, visual transition indicators. Sativa varieties: longer flowering (10-16 weeks).
*   Life Cycle: Annual. Seed germination -> vegetative growth -> flowering -> seed production (within 1 year). Cotyledon leaves development, progression through vegetative/flowering phases.
3.2. Chemical Profiles
Central to properties.
*   Cannabinoids: >140 identified. Major: Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabinol (CBN), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV). Minor cannabinoids. Chemical structures, biosynthetic pathways, pharmacological effects. THC: primary psychoactive. CBD: non-psychoactive, therapeutic properties.
*   Terpenes: >120 identified. Common: myrcene, limonene, pinene, linalool, caryophyllene. Chemical structures, biosynthetic origins, aroma/flavor contribution, potential therapeutic effects (incl. "entourage effect" - synergistic with cannabinoids).
*   Flavonoids: Major: cannflavins A, B, C; quercetin. Chemical structures, potential health benefits (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory). Cannflavins: unique to cannabis, significant anti-inflammatory activity.
*   Other Chemical Constituents: >550 compounds reported. Hydrocarbons, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, sugars, ketones, aldehydes, organic acids, fatty acids, amino acids.
3.3. Cultivation Conditions
For optimal growth/composition.
*   Environmental Requirements: Light (intensity, spectrum, photoperiod: longer for vegetative, shorter for flowering). Temperature (optimal day: 24-30°C vegetative, 65-85°F flowering; cooler nights). Humidity (ideal 40-70% RH, varies by stage). Airflow (CO2, humidity, temp regulation). Sativa strains: need more warmth than Indica.
*   Growth Medium: Soil, hydroponics, aeroponics. Soil pH (optimal 5.8-6.5). Suitable soil: rich, fertile, loamy, loose, breathable, highly absorbent.
*   Nutrient Requirements: Macro/micronutrients by growth stage. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) (N-P-K ratios). Sativa: more N than K/P. High N for vegetative.
*   Watering: Frequency/amount depends on stage, environment, medium. Avoid overwatering; allow soil dry down. Water pH: ideal 5.5-6.5.
*   Growth Stages & Specific Needs: Environmental, nutritional, watering needs per stage (germination, seedling, vegetative, flowering). Seedlings: high humidity, consistent moisture.
*   Common Cultivation Challenges: Pests, fungal diseases (bud rot, powdery mildew), mold (high humidity), nutrient deficiencies. Strong odor (esp. flowering).
3.4. Effects on Users
Applications/risks.
*   Physiological Effects: Short-term (↑heart rate, ↓blood pressure, altered sensory perception, impaired motor skills, ↑appetite, dry mouth, red eyes). Long-term (potential respiratory difficulties, cardiovascular risks, adolescent brain development impacts).
*   Psychological Effects: Short-term (euphoria, relaxation, anxiety, paranoia, altered time perception, impaired memory/concentration). Long-term (potential ↑risk: psychosis, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety; potential IQ impacts with early onset use).
*   Short-Term vs. Long-Term Effects: Distinction between immediate/delayed body/mind consequences.
*   Potential Risks and Benefits: Balanced overview. Risks (addiction, mental health issues). Benefits (reported therapeutic).
*   Factors Influencing Effects: Dosage, consumption method (smoking, vaping, edibles), individual physiology, product chemical profile. Onset/duration vary by method.

*   Mechanisms of Action: Cannabinoid/constituent interaction with endocannabinoid system (CB1/CB2 receptors), other biological pathways.
*   Dosage Guidelines: Current recommendations/research. "Start low and go slow" titration. Lack of standardized guidelines; importance of individual patient factors.
*   Delivery Methods: Inhalation, oral (edibles, capsules, tinctures), topical, suppositories. Implications for onset, duration, bioavailability.
*   FDA-Approved Cannabis-Based Medications: List/description. Epidiolex (purified CBD for certain seizures), dronabinol (synthetic THC), nabilone (synthetic cannabinoid) - for chemo nausea/vomiting, HIV/AIDS appetite increase.
