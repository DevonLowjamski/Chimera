**1. Executive Summary**
Cannabis industry growth requires understanding optimal cultivation for yield, quality, sustainability. Research Plan: Investigates Cannabis sativa macro/micro nutrient requirements vs. fertilizer types (organic, inorganic, slow-release). Objectives: Elucidate life-cycle nutrient needs; determine fertilizer effectiveness; identify nutrient interactions affecting growth/secondary metabolite production. Method: Controlled experiments, analytical techniques. Aim: Evidence-based fertilization recommendations for cultivators, scientific industry advancement.

**2. Introduction**
Cannabis sativa L.: Economic/medicinal importance drives cultivation expansion, demanding optimized agricultural practices. Nutrient management: Pivotal for health, biomass, secondary metabolites (cannabinoids, terpenes). Limited research due to past legal restrictions; cultivators rely on anecdote, general guidelines, non-validated fertilizer company recommendations, leading to reduced yields, environmental issues (inefficient/excessive fertilizer). Knowledge Gaps: Optimal nutrient ratios, uptake mechanisms, fertilizer type impacts on growth/quality. Existing research: Some macronutrient/NPK studies, but complex macro/micro nutrient interactions largely unexplored. Focus often vegetative, less on flowering (max cannabinoid/terpene production). Plan Addresses Gaps: Framework for investigating cannabis macro/micro nutrients vs. major fertilizer types. Objectives: Literature review, research questions, experimental methodologies, data collection/analysis, outcomes, challenges, timeline/resources. Legalization/Commercialization Demand: Scientific data for best cultivation, especially nutrient management. Prohibition void necessitates evidence-based guidelines. Current practices: Often non-scientific, needing data-driven efficiency/waste reduction. Environmental Impact: Nutrient runoff from improper fertilization necessitates sustainable strategies. Plan considers yield, quality, environmental footprint.

**3. Literature Review**
**Cannabis Macronutrient Requirements:**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** Cornerstone for vegetative growth, chlorophyll synthesis (photosynthesis), plant health. Hydroponic vegetative optimal N: 160-200 mg L⁻¹. Deficiency: Yellowing older/lower leaves, stunted growth, poor canopy. Excess: Negative flowering transition, reduced flower formation, potentially lower cannabinoids. N needs vary by fertilizer type; organic N may need higher conc. vs. synthetic for similar response. Variability in optimal N reports (study, growth stage, fertilizer) needs nuanced understanding across systems/cultivars.
*   **Phosphorus (P):** Critical for root development, flowering initiation/progression, seed formation. Hydroponic vegetative optimal P: ~30 mg L⁻¹. Deficiency: Darkening leaves (older), red/purple stems, stunted growth. High P in flowering: Common grower practice, not scientifically conclusive. Excess P: Can induce other micronutrient deficiencies; balanced application important. High P flowering belief needs investigation for optimality, negative nutrient interactions.
*   **Potassium (K):** Crucial for water absorption regulation, enzyme activation (metabolism), plant structure/resilience. Hydroponic vegetative optimal K: ~60 mg L⁻¹. Deficiency: Yellowing/browning leaf edges (older), leaf curling/twisting. K response in flowering: Less defined, may vary by cultivar. Oversupply: Interferes with Magnesium (Mg), Calcium (Ca) uptake. Inconsistent optimal K (esp. flowering), cultivar needs, antagonistic interactions require research.
*   **Calcium (Ca):** Fundamental for cell walls (structural integrity), transport of other mineral nutrients. Deficiency: Interveinal yellowing, brown spots (newer growth), weak stems, poor root development. Excess: Hinders Mg, K uptake (imbalances). Optimal leaf Ca: ~0.56 mg g⁻¹. Balanced Ca crucial for structure, efficient nutrient absorption/utilization. Research needed: Ca interactions with other nutrients across growth stages.
*   **Magnesium (Mg):** Central atom in chlorophyll (indispensable for photosynthesis), key plant enzyme function. Deficiency: Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins, older leaves). Mg uptake negatively impacted by high P, K in medium. Importance clear, optimal leaf conc. not detailed. Antagonism with P/K highlights need for balanced fertilization. Research needed: Optimal Mg levels relative to other macronutrients.
*   **Sulfur (S):** Essential for protein synthesis, enzyme activity. Deficiency: Yellowing newer/upper leaves (older leaves green), distinct from N deficiency. Optimal leaf S: ~0.38 mg g⁻¹. Oversupply: Leaf burn; careful application. Vital role, often less attention than NPK. Research: Ensure adequate S in fertilization strategies, esp. with fertilizers varying in S content/availability.

**Cannabis Micronutrient Requirements:**
Deficiency Symptoms/Excess Effects:
*   **Iron (Fe):** Deficiency: Interveinal chlorosis (younger leaves, new growth). Excess: Burnt leaf tips.
*   **Manganese (Mn):** Deficiency: Interveinal chlorosis (younger leaves); severe: brown spots. Mn toxicity threshold needs investigation.
*   **Zinc (Zn):** Deficiency: Interveinal yellowing (younger leaves), reduced leaf size, distorted growth. Excess: Potential nutrient lockout.
*   **Copper (Cu):** Deficiency: Bluish hue (new growth), purple undertones (veins, petioles).
*   **Boron (B):** Deficiency: Stunted growth, distorted new foliage, death of growing tips (advanced). Toxicity: Marginal yellowing, necrosis (lower leaves).
*   **Molybdenum (Mo):** Component of research nutrient solutions; specific cannabis requirements/deficiency/toxicity symptoms not detailed.
*   **Silica (Si):** Deficiency: Weak stems, yellowing/stressed leaves (curling/wilting), increased pest/disease susceptibility.
Note: Current information provides visual deficiency symptoms; lacks quantitative data on optimal levels and detailed toxicity symptoms for cannabis. This is a critical research area.

**Commonly Used Fertilizer Types:**
*   **Organic Fertilizers:** Derived from natural sources (plant materials, animal manures, minerals). Examples: Compost, manures, bone meal, seaweed extracts. Nutrient release: Gradual, via soil microorganism breakdown. Benefits: Improved soil health, reduced over-fertilization risk, enhanced microbial activity, improved soil structure, potential flavor/aroma enhancement. Drawbacks: Slower results vs. synthetic; effectiveness influenced by microbial activity factors (temp, moisture); variable nutrient content. NPK recommendations may differ vs. synthetic. Slower release/microbial reliance requires careful management, understanding of availability timelines.
*   **Inorganic/Synthetic Fertilizers:** Chemically manufactured, nutrients in readily available forms. Examples: Ammonium sulfate, super phosphates. Benefits: Fast-acting (quick deficiency correction), precise nutrient ratio control, generally cost-effective, widely accessible. Drawbacks: Higher over-fertilization/nutrient runoff risk (negative environmental impact); long-term use may degrade soil health (reduced organic matter, beneficial microbes). Rapid delivery/precise control useful for deficiencies, but environmental/soil health concerns require responsible use, exploration of sustainable alternatives.
*   **Slow-Release Fertilizers:** Release nutrients gradually over extended period. Types: Organic (e.g., bone meal) or synthetic (coated granules). Advantages: Reduced over-fertilization risk, less frequent application. Drawbacks: May take longer to become available vs. quick-release. Caution: Advised against for cannabis flowering stage (potential excessive N when P/K needs higher). Offer convenience, minimize nutrient burn. Suitability for cannabis (esp. flowering) needs evaluation to avoid imbalances affecting yield/quality.
