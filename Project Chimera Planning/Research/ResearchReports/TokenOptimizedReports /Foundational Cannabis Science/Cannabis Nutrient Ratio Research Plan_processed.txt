**Comprehensive Research Plan: Optimizing Nutrient Ratios for Cannabis Cultivation**

**1. Introduction**
**1.1 Rationale and Significance**
Cannabis sativa L. (Cannabis) increasing legalization (medicinal/recreational) drives industry growth, demanding scientifically optimized cultivation for product quality, consistency, yield. Nutrient management is central. Essential mineral nutrients profoundly influence Cannabis plant growth, development, biomass yield, and biosynthesis/accumulation of secondary metabolites (cannabinoids e.g., THC, CBD; terpenes), which dictate therapeutic efficacy/market value. Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) systems (hydroponics, soilless media) offer precision nutrient management, controlling environmental variables (light, temperature, humidity, CO2) and root-zone conditions (pH, Electrical Conductivity - EC, nutrient solution composition). CEA optimizes resource use efficiency (water, fertilizers) vs. traditional field agriculture, vital for maximizing productivity and minimizing environmental footprint (nutrient runoff, resource depletion).

**1.2 Current Knowledge Gaps and Challenges**
Scientific understanding of optimal fertilizer nutrient ratios for Cannabis is limited, contradictory. Commercial practices rely on anecdotal evidence, clandestine-derived grower experience, or generic fertilizer company recipes, not rigorous science.
Knowledge gap factors:
*   Historical prohibition restricted research on "drug-type" Cannabis (phenotypes I/II for cannabinoids) vs. "fiber-type" hemp (phenotype III). These types have distinct genetics, traits (biomass vs. flower/cannabinoid), and different nutrient requirements/utilization efficiencies (esp. Nitrogen - N, Phosphorus - P).
*   Literature presents conflicting data on optimal P, Potassium (K) levels. Reported optima vary by cultivar, growing system (Deep Water Culture - DWC, Nutrient Film Technique - NFT, coco coir, peat mixes), environmental conditions (light intensity/spectrum, CO2, root zone temperature - RZT), and experimental methodologies. Context-dependency suggests no universal optimal recipe; research needs specificity (cultivar, system, environment).
Nutrient supply vs. secondary metabolite production:
*   Potential trade-off: nutrient regimes maximizing biomass may not maximize cannabinoid/terpene concentration.
*   Slight nutrient stress/deficiency (esp. N, P, K) may increase cannabinoid/terpene concentrations (plant stress response).
*   High nutrient levels (vigorous growth) may cause "dilution effect": total secondary metabolites increase (greater biomass), but tissue concentration decreases.
*   Nutrient form (e.g., ammonium NH4+ vs. nitrate NO3- for N) influences plant function, yield, secondary metabolite profiles.
*   Late-stage nutrient manipulation/"flushing" (plain water pre-harvest) lacks robust scientific validation for improving final product quality (taste, smoothness, ash color). Flushing studies: minimal impact on bud nutrient/cannabinoid/terpene levels, sometimes negative taste panel impact.
Lack of standardized research protocols/reporting hinders comparison/synthesis. Variations (experimental design, environmental controls, measurement, stats) cause result discrepancies (true biological differences vs. methodological inconsistencies).

**1.3 Research Scope Overview**
Addresses gaps via rigorous, systematic investigation of varying macronutrient ratios (N, P, K) effects on Cannabis growth, yield, quality in precisely controlled hydroponics. Encompasses vegetative/flowering stages, using selected, commercially relevant, clonal Cannabis (genetic uniformity).
Quantified parameters: vegetative growth metrics (height, stem diameter, biomass accumulation rate), final yield (inflorescence dry weight - DW), nutrient uptake/partitioning, concentrations of major cannabinoids (THCA, CBDA, CBGA, THC, CBD, CBG) and representative terpenes (myrcene, limonene, α-pinene, β-pinene, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene) in mature inflorescences.
Emphasizes scientific best practices: stringent CEA environmental control, adequate replication, randomization, precise/validated measurement techniques (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography - HPLC for cannabinoids, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry - GC-MS for terpenes, Inductively Coupled Plasma - ICP for tissue nutrients), appropriate statistical analysis (ANOVA, regression, potentially Response Surface Methodology - RSM).
Goal: generate reliable, quantitative data for evidence-based nutrient management strategies, enhancing Cannabis physiology understanding and commercial cultivation optimization (yield vs. quality). Detailed reporting of methods/conditions aims to improve comparability/utility.

**2. Research Objectives**
**2.1 Reasoning**
Clear, specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound (SMART) objectives guide research, address gaps, contribute meaningfully. Overarching goal: optimize NPK ratios for Cannabis in CEA (growth, yield, chemical profile).

**2.2 Primary Objective**
Quantitatively determine optimal N:P:K nutrient ratios (concentrations mg L-1 or ppm in hydroponic solution) to maximize distinct key performance indicators (KPIs) for selected Cannabis cultivar under controlled environmental conditions. Specifically, identify NPK ratios optimizing:
*   a) Vegetative Growth: Max growth rate (height increase/day, biomass accumulation rate), total vegetative biomass (leaf/stem DW) at end of defined vegetative period.
*   b) Inflorescence Yield: Max DW yield of trimmed inflorescences (buds) per plant or per unit area (g/plant or g/m2) at harvest.
*   c) Cannabinoid Potency and Yield: Max concentration (% DW) AND total yield (mg/plant or g/m2) of key phytocannabinoids (THCA, CBDA, CBGA, THC, CBD, CBG) in mature, harvested inflorescences.
*   d) Terpene Profile and Yield: Max concentration (%) AND total yield (mg/plant or g/m2) of representative/commercially important monoterpenes (myrcene, limonene, α-pinene, β-pinene) and sesquiterpenes (β-caryophyllene, α-humulene) in mature, harvested inflorescences.
Critical component: define potentially different optimal NPK ratios for maximizing yield (2.2b) vs. maximizing cannabinoid/terpene concentration (2.2c, 2.2d). Aim to quantify these potentially divergent optima and associated trade-offs.

**2.3 Secondary Objectives**
*   Systematically evaluate/document varying N:P:K ratio effects on plant health indicators throughout growth cycle: monitor/record onset/progression of visual nutrient deficiency/toxicity symptoms (standardized descriptors, photographic evidence); quantify leaf chlorophyll content (non-destructive SPAD/CCI meter) as N status/photosynthetic potential proxy.
*   Assess different N:P:K supply ratio impact on nutrient uptake dynamics/allocation: analyze elemental concentrations (N, P, K, key secondary macronutrients Ca, Mg, S, micronutrients) in plant tissues (leaves, stems, roots, inflorescences) at critical developmental stages (end veg, mid-flowering, final harvest). Provides insight into supply vs. accumulation/partitioning, explains responses, identifies luxury consumption/nutrient antagonism.
*   Investigate/quantify potential N, P, K supply interactive effects on primary/secondary outcomes (growth, yield, cannabinoid/terpene profiles, nutrient uptake). Optimal level of one nutrient may depend on others.
*   (Optional Extension) Evaluate optimized NPK implications for resource use efficiency: calculate Nutrient Use Efficiency (NUE) metrics (biomass produced per unit nutrient supplied/taken up) for biomass and cannabinoid production. Could compare mineral vs. organic sources or scientifically evaluate late-flower nutrient manipulation/flushing strategies on NUE/final product quality.

**3. Literature Review Synthesis**
**3.1 Reasoning**
Comprehensive literature synthesis is foundational: establishes current scientific knowledge on Cannabis nutrition, identifies consensus/controversy, pinpoints critical knowledge gaps, provides scientific rationale for hypotheses/experimental approach. Focus: macronutrients (N,P,K), key micronutrients, interactions, CEA environmental factors, specific effects on Cannabis secondary metabolite production.

**3.2 Macronutrient Roles (N, P, K)**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** Critical for growth (proteins, enzymes, chlorophyll). Cannabis high N demand in vegetative stage (leaf/stem development). Recommended N concentrations often decrease in flowering. Excessive N supply during flowering frequently linked to reduced cannabinoid (THCA, CBDA)/terpene concentrations (dilution effect or direct interference with pathways). RSM/hydroponics studies: optimal N for flowering yield ~160-200 mg L-1; vegetative optima similar/slightly higher. N form (NH4+/NO3-) significant: high NH4+/NO3- ratios can impair growth, reduce yield, negatively affect cannabinoid/terpene profiles, potentially cause toxicity. Exclusive NO3- nutrition often yields best results for secondary metabolites. Hemp-type Cannabis may reach optimal N at lower concentrations, exhibit higher NUE vs. drug-type.
*   **Phosphorus (P):** Fundamental role in energy transfer (ATP), nucleic acid synthesis (DNA, RNA), membrane structure; crucial for root development, flower/seed initiation/development. P demand typically increases during transition to/throughout flowering. Optimal P concentration (esp. flowering) highly debated. Reported optima range widely: some studies suggest max yield/quality at low concentrations (11-15 mg L-1), others indicate 30 mg L-1, 60 mg L-1, or up to 90 mg L-1 (cultivar-dependent). Several studies: no significant increase in flower yield/cannabinoid concentration when P supply > ~11-25 mg L-1. Discrepancy highlights need for standardized research methodologies (cultivars, systems, measurement timing, statistical power). Evidence: low P supply (near deficiency) can increase certain cannabinoid concentrations (often at expense of biomass yield). Cannabis inflorescences strong P sinks (accumulate higher conc. than leaves). P Over-fertilization: major environmental concern (eutrophication via runoff).
*   **Potassium (K):** Involved in osmotic regulation (stomatal control), enzyme activation, protein synthesis, photosynthesis, carbohydrate transport; plant stress resistance. K demand generally increases during flowering (bud development, resin production). Optimal K levels debated. Some RSM hydroponics: no significant inflorescence yield response to K 60-340 mg L-1 (lower end may be sufficient). Other research: optimal K 60-175 mg L-1 for flowering. Similar to N/P, low K (e.g., 15 mg L-1) can impair growth/yield but may increase cannabinoid/terpene concentration; levels > ~60 mg L-1 often decrease secondary metabolite concentrations without further yield benefits. High K can interfere with Calcium (Ca)/Magnesium (Mg) uptake (competitive inhibition at root sites).

**3.3 Micronutrient Roles (Brief Overview)**
*   **Calcium (Ca) & Magnesium (Mg):** Ca vital for cell wall structure/membrane function. Mg central to chlorophyll, essential for photosynthesis/enzyme activation. Increased Ca/Mg demand under LED lighting or high K supply. Deficiencies: Mg (interveinal chlorosis older/mid-plant leaves); Ca (necrotic spots, distorted new growth, tip burn). Optimal (not deficient) Mg (e.g., 35 mg L-1) may be required for maximizing cannabinoid concentrations. Cation competition (high K or NH4+) can induce Ca/Mg deficiencies.
*   **Sulfur (S):** Component of essential amino acids (methionine, cysteine), protein/enzyme structure. May support terpene synthesis. Deficiency: general yellowing (often younger leaves first).
*   **Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu):** Primarily cofactors in enzymatic reactions (chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthesis). Deficiencies: various symptoms (interveinal chlorosis younger leaves, stunted growth, necrosis). Availability highly pH-dependent (decreases at higher pH). Mn toxicity risk at low pH (<5.5) in hydroponics. Fe crucial for chlorophyll; one study linked increased Fe (with P, K) to higher THC yield.
*   **Boron (B):** Essential for cell wall synthesis/integrity, membrane function, potentially carbohydrate metabolism/reproductive development. Uptake primarily as uncharged boric acid. Relatively immobile; deficiency symptoms on new growth (distorted, stunted, necrotic growing tips, brittle stems, poor flower/pollen development). B toxicity: marginal yellowing/necrosis on older leaves. Indirect links to secondary metabolism via cell wall integrity/signaling.
*   **Silicon (Si):** Not strictly essential but provides benefits (stress conditions, hydroponics). Deposits in cell walls (phytoliths), strengthens tissues, improves plant architecture, increases pest/disease resistance. Alleviates abiotic stresses (drought, salinity, heavy metal toxicity). Cannabis (hemp) studies: supplemental Si (silicate) bioavailable, increases leaf Si content, can potentially increase inflorescence yield without negatively impacting cannabinoid/terpene profiles. Si may limit excessive uptake of certain micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu) or heavy metals.

**3.4 Nutrient Interactions and Environmental Factors**
*   **Nutrient Interactions:** Balance critical. RSM studies: significant N, P, K interactions affect growth parameters (root, stem, leaf mass, leaf area, chlorophyll). Antagonistic relationships: high K inhibits Ca/Mg uptake; high P potentially affects micronutrient availability. N form (NH4+ vs. NO3-) influences other cation uptake.
*   **Environmental Factors (CEA Context):** Nutrient requirements linked to environment.
    *   Light: Higher intensity (PPFD) increases photosynthetic rates/growth, thus nutrient demand. Light spectrum influences specific metabolite production.
    *   CO2 Enrichment: Elevated CO2 boosts photosynthesis/growth, significantly higher N,P,K,micronutrient demand. Optimal nutrients must match CO2 levels for yield benefits.
    *   Root Zone Temperature (RZT): Directly impacts root metabolism, respiration, water/nutrient uptake rate. Optimal RZT for Cannabis: 20-24°C (68-75°F). Outside range significantly reduces nutrient uptake/growth.
    *   Growing Medium: Soilless substrate properties crucial. Inert media (rockwool) minimal impact on nutrient availability (complete delivery via solution). Organic-based (peat, coco coir) have Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), retain/release cationic nutrients (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+). Coco coir notable CEC, can preferentially bind Ca/Mg (potential deficiencies if not accounted for with coco-specific nutrients/buffering). Substrate choice dictates irrigation/fertilization.
    *   Hydroponic Solution Management: Precise control paramount. pH within optimal range (typically 5.5-6.5 for soilless/hydroponics) critical for all essential nutrient availability. EC monitors total dissolved salts (nutrients). Monitoring input/runoff EC manages delivery, prevents excessive root zone salt buildup. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) essential for root respiration/nutrient uptake (esp. DWC). Low DO (<5 mg L-1) promotes anaerobic conditions, pathogens (Pythium/root rot), impairs root function.

**3.5 Nutrient Effects on Secondary Metabolites**
Mineral nutrition significantly impacts Cannabis chemical profile (cannabinoids, terpenes).
*   **General Trend & Potential Mechanisms:** Recurring inverse relationship: supply of major macronutrients (N,P,K) vs. concentration (not necessarily total yield/plant) of cannabinoids/terpenes in inflorescences. Possible explanations: "dilution effect" (rapid biomass accumulation under high fertility dilutes metabolite concentration); or moderate nutrient stress actively triggers/enhances secondary metabolite biosynthesis (defense/adaptation mechanism). Nutrients as signals influencing pathways or affecting precursor availability (e.g., geranyl diphosphate from MEP pathway for cannabinoids/terpenes).
*   **Specific Nutrient Effects:**
    *   Nitrogen: High N supply consistently correlates with lower THCA, CBDA, various terpene concentrations. N form (NH4+ vs. NO3-) significantly impacts profiles (high NH4+ generally reduces conc. vs. NO3- dominant).
    *   Phosphorus: Effect less consistent. Some studies: increased cannabinoid conc. under P deficiency; others: little/no effect on major cannabinoids once P above deficiency. One study: P deficiency increased geraniol.
    *   Potassium: Low K supply often leads to higher acidic cannabinoid/most terpene concentrations; conc. decrease as K supply increases into optimal growth range. Terpene effects can be genotype-specific.
*   **Other Influencing Factors:** Biostimulants (amino acid supplements) alter terpene profiles (potentially increasing monoterpenes like limonene/myrcene, decreasing cannabinoids like CBNA). Cultivation environment: outdoor living soil vs. indoor artificial lights -> significantly different terpene profiles (often higher sesquiterpenes outdoor), lower oxidized/degraded cannabinoids outdoor. Light spectrum/intensity modulate cannabinoid/terpene synthesis.

**3.6 Research Gaps Identified**
*   Conflicting Optima: Lack of consensus on optimal P, K concentrations for flowering yield/quality.
*   Cultivar Specificity: Insufficient comparative studies (diverse, commercially relevant cultivars, identical controlled conditions) to parse genetic vs. environmental effects on nutrient response.
*   Micronutrient Roles: Limited understanding of specific roles/optimal levels of micronutrients (esp. B, Si, Fe, Mn, Zn) in Cannabis, particularly influence on secondary metabolism and interactions with macronutrients.
*   Integrated Systems Approach: Need studies integrating nutrient management with other critical CEA variables (light spectrum/intensity, CO2, RZT, DO).
*   Validation of Grower Practices: Lack of rigorous scientific validation for common practices (high-P "bloom boosters", pre-harvest flushing).
*   Terpene Focus: Limited research specifically targeting nutrition effects on full terpene profile, underlying biosynthesis pathways, terpene synthase (TPS) gene expression.
*   Nutrient Use Efficiency (NUE): More research needed to quantify/optimize NUE and Water Use Efficiency (WUE) in Cannabis CEA for sustainability/reduced production costs.

**4. Hypotheses**
**4.1 Reasoning**
Specific, testable hypotheses from literature/objectives, predict NPK concentration effects on growth, yield, quality. Framework for design/analysis.

**4.2 Primary Hypotheses** (Varying N,P,K in hydroponics, selected Cannabis cultivar):
*   H1 (Vegetative Growth): N 160-240 mg L-1 (non-limiting P,K) -> significantly greater vegetative biomass (leaf/stem DW) vs. N <120 mg L-1. (N's primary role in veg. dev.).
*   H2 (Flowering Yield): Inflorescence DW yield quadratic response to N, P; maximized at intermediate N:160-200 mg L-1 & P:40-60 mg L-1 (DWC studies). Yield lower below/above optima. K (sufficient range e.g., 60-200 mg L-1) no significant yield effect.
*   H3 (Cannabinoid Concentration): % THCA, CBDA (mature dried inflorescences) significantly higher with lowest non-deficient N,P vs. higher N,P (biomass-maximizing). (Inverse correlation/dilution effect).
*   H4 (Terpene Concentration): % key monoterpenes (myrcene, limonene), sesquiterpenes (β-caryophyllene) (mature dried inflorescences) significantly higher with lower (non-deficient) N,K vs. higher N,K.
*   H5 (Total Cannabinoid/Terpene Yield): Total cannabinoid/terpene yield (mg/plant or g/m2) maximized under same intermediate N,P as inflorescence biomass (H2), despite potentially lower concentrations (H3,H4). (Flower mass increase outweighs % conc. decrease).

**4.3 Secondary Hypotheses** (Plant health, nutrient interactions):
*   H6 (Plant Health Indicators): Specific visual nutrient deficiency symptoms (e.g., N: lower leaf chlorosis; Mg: interveinal chlorosis; K/Ca/P: tip burn/spotting) correlate with significantly reduced foliar element concentrations vs. control. Visual symptoms may occur after tissue concentrations fall below critical. Leaf chlorophyll (SPAD/CCI) strong positive correlation with foliar N.
*   H7 (Nutrient Interactions): Statistically significant N,P,K supply interaction effects for key responses (biomass yield, potentially cannabinoid/terpene concentrations). (Response to one nutrient dependent on others).
(Hypotheses test core questions, esp. yield-vs-quality balance (H2/H5 vs. H3/H4). Facilitate quantitative modeling via regression.)

**5. Experimental Design**
**5.1 Reasoning**
Robust, meticulously controlled design isolates NPK effects, tests hypotheses accurately. Emphasizes minimizing experimental error, ensuring validity/reproducibility in CEA. Prioritizes precision nutrient delivery, environmental control, genetic uniformity, statistical power.

    *   Carbon Dioxide (CO2): Monitored continuously. If resources permit, supplement to 800-1000 ppm; if not, ambient (~400-500 ppm) maintained/recorded.
    *   Air Circulation: Internal fans for air movement (prevent stratification, promote transpiration).
    *   Dissolved Oxygen (DO): DWC reservoirs >5 mg L-1 (ideally near saturation) via air pumps/stones. Monitored regularly. Critical in DWC (stagnant, warm water -> hypoxia).

**5.3 Plant Material**
*   Cultivar Selection: Single, commercially relevant, well-documented Cannabis cultivar (e.g., high-THC Type I, balanced Type II, high-CBD Type III like 'T1'/'Trump', 'Wappa', 'The New'). Consistency key.
*   Propagation Method: Exclusively genetically identical vegetative clones from single, healthy, virus-indexed mother plant (eliminates genetic variation).

*   Nutrient Solution Management: Entire DWC solution volume completely replaced regularly (min. weekly). Solution pH monitored daily (or continuously), adjusted to target range (e.g., 5.8-6.2) using dilute acids (phosphoric/nitric) or bases (KOH). Solution EC monitored daily. DO levels checked regularly (>5 mg L-1).

**5.5 Replication and Randomization**
*   Experimental Unit: Single Cannabis plant in individual DWC container.
*   Replication: Each unique NPK treatment combination (CCRD incl. center points) replicated min. 4-6 times (plants). Sufficient statistical power.
*   Randomization: Treatments assigned completely at random to units/positions. If environmental gradients (e.g., light), Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) implemented (blocks for similar conditions, each treatment random within each block). Physical DWC unit positions re-randomized periodically (e.g., weekly) if feasible.

**5.6 Duration**
*   Acclimation: Post-transplant, all plants receive standard, balanced nutrient solution (e.g., center point) for 3-7 days before NPK treatments.
*   Vegetative Stage: 2-4 weeks under treatment.
*   Flowering Stage: Photoperiod switched to 12/12. Plants remain under NPK treatments until physiological maturity (standardized visual indicators: trichome coloration ~50% amber, or pistil senescence), typically 8-10 weeks post-switch. All plants harvested within narrow time window.

**7. Data Analysis Plan**
**7.1 Reasoning**
Predefined plan ensures objectivity, appropriate statistical tools for hypotheses, valid conclusions. Outlines data prep, methods, software, presentation. Standard in agricultural/plant science.

**7.2 Data Preparation**
1.  Data Entry/Verification: Raw data to structured digital format (Excel, CSV, database). Double-check accuracy.
2.  Data Cleaning: Screen for errors, inconsistencies, biologically implausible values. Identify outliers (box plots, standardized residuals), investigate. Document/justify outlier removal/correction. Note/handle missing data.
3.  Assumption Checking (for parametric tests like ANOVA, regression on key responses):
    *   Normality: Residual distribution assessed (Q-Q plots, histograms, Shapiro-Wilk test).
    *   Homogeneity of Variances (Homoscedasticity): Residual variance equal across groups (residual vs. fitted plots, Levene's/Bartlett's test).
4.  Data Transformation: If assumptions violated, apply transformations (logarithmic, square root, arcsine for % data). If unsuccessful, consider non-parametric methods.

**7.3 Statistical Methods**
1.  Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): Determine overall statistical significance of N,P,K treatments (main effects) & interactions on responses (biomass, cannabinoids, terpenes, tissue nutrients, chlorophyll).
    *   One-way ANOVA for single-factor comparisons.
    *   Multi-way ANOVA for N,P,K effects/interactions (N,P,K, N×P, N×K, P×K, N×P×K).
    *   If RCBD, 'Block' as factor.
    *   Significance level α ≤ 0.05. Report F-statistic, p-value.
2.  Mean Separation Tests (Post-Hoc): If ANOVA significant (p≤0.05), Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test for all pairwise comparisons among means. Controls family-wise error rate. Letter groupings/significance indicators.
3.  Regression Analysis: Model quantitative relationship between nutrient concentrations (N,P,K) and key continuous responses (yield, cannabinoid/terpene conc.).
    *   Polynomial regression (e.g., quadratic) for curvilinear responses, estimate optimal levels (H2, H5).
    *   Linear regression for linear relationships (H3, H4).
    *   Assess model fit (R^2, residual analysis, significance of coefficients p≤0.05). Equations predict responses.
4.  Correlation Analysis: Pearson (normal data) or Spearman rank (non-normal/monotonic) coefficients for strength/direction of associations (e.g., supply vs. tissue conc.; yield vs. cannabinoid conc.; SPAD vs. foliar N).
5.  Response Surface Methodology (RSM) Analysis (if CCRD design): Fit second-order polynomial model to responses vs. coded N,P,K levels.
    *   Determine significance of linear, quadratic, interaction terms.
    *   Generate predictive equations.
    *   Identify N,P,K combination for max/min response.
    *   Create contour/3D surface plots for visualization.

**8. Expected Outcomes and Implications**
**8.1 Reasoning**
Anticipating outcomes/implications essential for understanding study's potential impact. Likely results (based on hypotheses, literature), significance for science and practical Cannabis cultivation.

**8.2 Anticipated Results**
*   Distinct Optima: Optimal NPK ratios differ by growth stage (veg vs. flower) & desired outcome (biomass yield vs. cannabinoid/terpene conc.). Intermediate N (~160-200 mg L-1) + intermediate P (~40-60 mg L-1) likely maximize inflorescence DW yield. K effect on yield within tested sufficient range (e.g., 60-200 mg L-1) minimal/non-significant.
*   Yield vs. Concentration Trade-off: Clear inverse relationship: N,P,K supply conc. vs. % major cannabinoids (THCA,CBDA)/key terpenes. Highest concentrations likely at lowest non-deficient nutrient levels.
*   Quantification of Total Metabolite Yield: Total cannabinoid/terpene yield (mg/plant or g/m2) expected to peak under same intermediate N,P conditions as biomass yield. Greater flower mass likely compensates for lower % concentration.
*   Nutrient Interactions: Significant interactions (N×P, N×K, N×P×K) anticipated to influence biomass, possibly chemotype. Optimal level for one nutrient contingent on others.
*   Diagnostic Indicators: Correlations expected: visual symptoms, SPAD/CCI readings, foliar nutrient conc. Could establish practical diagnostic thresholds (cultivar-specific), though symptom onset might lag tissue deficiency.

**8.3 Scientific Implications**
*   Resolving Literature Conflicts: Robust, quantitative NPK optima data (specific cultivar, DWC) helps clarify conflicting findings (esp. P,K in flowering).
*   Mechanistic Understanding: Integrated data (yield, chemical profiles, tissue nutrients) provides insights into nutrient uptake, partitioning, NUE, physiological mechanisms (yield-conc. trade-off, interactions).
*   Secondary Metabolism Regulation: Enhances understanding of macronutrient influence on secondary metabolite biosynthesis in Cannabis. Empirical data on nutrient stress vs. metabolite conc. (stress-induced synthesis vs. dilution).
*   Foundation for Future Work: Detailed methodology/findings serve as basis for research on micronutrients, environmental interactions, cultivar comparisons, biostimulants.

**8.4 Practical Applications for Cultivation (CEA)**
*   Evidence-Based Fertilizer Recipes: Data-driven, stage-specific NPK recommendations (tested cultivar, DWC). Cultivators can target max biomass yield or max cannabinoid/terpene conc. Quantitative data on yield vs. conc. trade-off for informed decisions.
*   Improved Diagnostics: Correlated data (visual symptoms, SPAD/CCI, tissue nutrients) -> more accurate/timely diagnosis of nutrient imbalances (specific cultivar), faster corrective actions.
*   Resource Optimization/Sustainability: Identification of precise optimal nutrient levels (current P,K rates may be excessive) offers opportunities to reduce fertilizer inputs. Cost savings, reduced environmental impact (manufacturing, runoff).
*   Informed Late-Flower Strategies: Data on late-flower nutrient uptake/quality effects provides scientific basis for evaluating/refining late-flower manipulation/flushing. Challenge practices lacking scientific support.
*   Support for Precision Fertigation: Essential data for programming/optimizing automated precision fertigation systems in CEA.
*   Cultivar-Specific Management Emphasis: Results underscore principle that nutrient management should be tailored to specific genetics. Encourages in-house trials.
