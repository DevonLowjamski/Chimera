**I. Introduction**
**1.1. Objective:** Outline comprehensive, systematic, actionable research plan detailing methodology for identifying, documenting, validating, organizing fundamental technical game programming concepts (functions, formulas, equations, algorithms, theorems forming modern game development's technical bedrock).
**1.2. Rationale/Significance:** Game development: rapid tech advancement, high specialization (graphics, physics, AI, audio, networking). Critical knowledge often fragmented (teams, legacy code, tacit developer knowledge). Fragmentation challenges: knowledge preservation, onboarding/training, technical understanding/implementation consistency. Systematically compiled/validated knowledge base (KB) addresses challenges. KB functions:
*   Knowledge Preservation/Transfer: Captures/codifies essential tech knowledge, accessible beyond experts/projects.
*   Onboarding/Training: Structured, reliable, accurate resource accelerating developer learning (new field/specialization).
*   Standardization: Fosters common technical vocabulary, shared understanding of fundamental algorithms/formulas.
*   Reference/Research: Quick-reference for established concepts, validated foundation for advanced/specialized topics.
Rigorous plan paramount (breadth, depth, interdisciplinary nature) ensuring KB comprehensive, accurate, logically organized, designed for long-term maintenance/expansion in evolving field.
**1.3. Scope Overview:** KB scope: technical concepts with direct application/significant adaptation in game programming (functions, formulas, equations, algorithms, core data structures, programming patterns in game features/engine systems). Foundational concepts (math: linear algebra, calculus; CS: data structures, algorithm analysis; physics: Newtonian mechanics) included if critically applied/adapted (e.g., vector math for graphics/physics, integration methods for physics simulation). Excludes high-level game design philosophies/abstract principles unless directly translatable to specific, implementable algorithms, formulas, data structures for programmers. This document is the plan, not the KB itself.

**II. Phase 1 (P1): Scope Definition & Taxonomy Development**
Focus: Establish KB boundaries, create logical organizing structure.
**2.1. Defining Inclusion Criteria:** Rigorous criteria for concept selection consistency/relevance:
*   Direct Applicability: Directly employed in game features, engine subsystems, dev tools (e.g., A* pathfinding; abstract graph theory only if specific theorem/algo commonly used).
*   Significance: Fundamental/widely utilized in ≥1 recognized game programming domain (Graphics, Physics, AI) (e.g., Quaternions for 3D rotation; not obscure niche theorems).
*   Specificity: Distinct to game dev or significant adaptation of broader math/CS principle (e.g., real-time collision detection algos: AABB checks, SAT for OBB; general Big O notation only if for specific game algo performance).
*   Technical Nature: Concrete technical elements: functions, formulas, equations, algorithms, theorems, core data structures/patterns (e.g., Object Pooling, Scene Graphs). Abstract design philosophies omitted unless manifest as specific, implementable tech.
**2.2. Establishing Major Categories:** Top-level classification aligned with game dev domains & engine architecture for intuitive navigation. Proposed (from common roles/engine components):

2.  Formal Definition: Concise, accurate definition (what it is, fundamental purpose).
3.  Formulas/Pseudocode: Core math (LaTeX: e.g., f(n)=g(n)+h(n) for A*; $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = |\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\cos\theta$ for dot product). Language-agnostic pseudocode for algos.
4.  Parameters/Variables: Define all symbols, params, vars in formulas/pseudocode.
5.  Core Principles/Properties: List key characteristics, assumptions (e.g., A* informed search, needs admissible heuristic for optimality; dot product commutative).
6.  Game Programming Context/Applications: How/why used in game dev. Concrete examples (dot product for FOV checks/basic lighting; Object Pooling for particles/projectiles; FSMs for NPC state mgt).
7.  Advantages/Disadvantages/Trade-offs: Benefits (A*'s efficiency w/ good heuristic; Object Pool perf gains) & limitations, issues, artifacts (A*'s memory intensity; shadow map aliasing; FSM complexity growth; numerical instability in integration).
8.  Related Concepts: Connections: prerequisites (vectors for dot product), alternatives (BTs vs FSMs), specializations (Blinn-Phong from Phong).
9.  Source Citations: Meticulously record full citation details (author, title, pub year, pages, URL). Shared reference tool (Zotero, Mendeley), consistent style (IEEE, APA).
**4.2. Standardized Documentation Template (Uniform for structure, detail, metadata consistency):**
Fields:
*   Concept ID: Unique identifier (internal linking/tracking).
*   Canonical Name: Primary, standardized (Ex: A* Search Algorithm).
*   Aliases: Alt names/abbreviations (Ex: A-Star).

*   Source Citations: Formatted list.
*   Diagrams/Visual Aids: (Optional) Placeholder/embedded (e.g., FSM state transitions, rendering pipeline flow).
Template ensures comprehensive documentation (what, how, why, when, why not in game prog context). Produces consistent, high-quality dataset.

**V. Phase 4 (P4): Logical Organization & Repository Structure**
Focus: Organize extracted/documented data logically, select hosting platform.
**5.1. Information Architecture:** Digital structure mirrors P1 taxonomy (logical, intuitive org). Key considerations:
*   Hierarchical Structure: Primary org; drill-down: Major categories (Graphics Rendering) -> subcategories (Lighting & Shading) -> concepts (Blinn-Phong Reflection Model).
*   Navigation: Multiple methods:
    *   Browse: Hierarchical category/subcategory structure.
    *   Search: Robust full-text (name, alias, keywords in def/app fields).
    *   Tag Filtering: Filter by cross-disciplinary tags (e.g., "Physics", "Linear Algebra").
*   Entry Points: Clear; main index (major categories, recent/frequently accessed concepts).
**5.2. Cross-referencing Implementation:** Vital for interconnectedness.
*   Dedicated "Related Concepts" Field: In template; lists related concepts, linked via unique Concept ID.
*   Inline Hyperlinks: Within def/app text, terms for other KB concepts hyperlinked.
*   Bidirectional Linking: Feasible/logical (e.g., Blinn-Phong links to Phong, Phong links back), facilitates exploration.
Strategy ensures easy navigation (foundational principles, specific impls, alternatives, related techniques).
**5.3. Repository Platform Selection:** Critical for long-term usability, maintainability, scalability.
Options/Trade-offs:
*   Internal Wiki (Confluence, MediaWiki): Pros: Familiar, good collab editing, internal tool integration. Cons: Basic search, less robust version control, limited presentation customization (formulas/diagrams).
*   Version-Controlled Doc Site (Sphinx, MkDocs, Docusaurus w/ Git): Pros: Excellent Git version control, highly customizable presentation, plugins (diagrams, MathJax/KaTeX), static site gen (fast, secure). Cons: Steeper learning curve (non-tech), less intuitive editing than WYSIWYG.
*   Custom DB/Web App: Pros: Max flexibility (data structure, query, presentation, features). Cons: Highest dev effort/cost, ongoing custom app maintenance.
Evaluation Criteria: Searchability (advanced: full-text, filter by cat/tag); Editability & Collaboration (contrib ease, review workflows, concurrent edit); Version Control (robust history, revert, branching); Access Control (read/write permissions); Extensibility & Customization (LaTeX via MathJax/KaTeX, diagrams, code snippets, custom styling); Maintainability (platform/content updates).
Recommendation: Version-Controlled Doc Site (Docusaurus/Sphinx on GitHub Pages/internal Git server) most suitable. Best balance: robust version control, presentation flexibility, tech content support. Aligns with expandable/updatable resource need.

**VI. Phase 5 (P5): Rigorous Validation & Verification**
Focus: Ensure tech accuracy, applicability, completeness. Multi-layered validation.
**6.1. Technical Accuracy Review Process:** Verify correctness (defs, formulas, algos, props).
*   Source Cross-Referencing: Every significant claim, formula, algo step verified against multiple, independent, high-quality P2 sources. Discrepancies investigated, resolved (prioritize authoritative/recent, or note discrepancy), documented. Crucial due to potential inaccuracies (even official docs).
*   Expert Peer Review: Drafted entries assigned to domain experts (graphics progs review rendering; AI specialists review pathfinding). Standardized checklist: correctness (defs, formulas, pseudocode), accuracy (props, principles), clarity/unambiguity, completeness, source relevance/accuracy.
*   Mathematical/Algorithmic Verification: Manual derivation checks for core math (vector ops, matrix transforms, quaternion math) & fundamental algos (A* steps, SAT projection logic). Compare documented algos to known, trusted reference impls (GLM, Eigen) or well-regarded open-source engines (Godot).
**6.2. Applicability & Context Check:** Beyond tech correctness, ensure game dev relevance/accurate context.
*   Contextual Relevance: Reviewers confirm game prog apps/use cases practical, common, clearly explained. Examples illustrative of real-world (e.g., FSMs for 'Patrolling', 'Attacking').
*   Trade-off Accuracy: Verify documented advantages, disadvantages, trade-offs, potential artifacts (e.g., shadow mapping artifacts: aliasing, peter-panning; quaternions avoiding gimbal lock vs Euler angles).
**6.3. Implementation Prototyping (Targeted):** Select subset of complex/critical algos.
*   Selection Criteria: Concepts with subtle impl details, prone to numerical instability, or conflicting source algo steps (e.g., specific BRDF impls: Cook-Torrance w/ GGX NDF & Smith G; complex impulse-based collision response w/ friction; nuanced job system scheduling patterns).
*   Process: Develop minimal code/tests from KB entry's pseudocode/formulas. Compare prototype behavior/output against expected/reference.
*   Feedback Loop: Discrepancies, ambiguities, missing details refine concept's documentation.
Practical validation bridges theory-practice, identifies nuances/edge cases missed in paper reviews, increases KB reliability/practical value.

**VII. Phase 6 (P6): Long-Term Maintenance & Expansion Plan**
Focus: Strategies for ongoing accuracy, relevance, comprehensiveness in evolving field.
**7.1. Update Strategy (Proactive):**
*   Periodic Review: Schedule regular, systematic reviews (e.g., annually/biennially) by domain experts. Check tech accuracy vs state-of-the-art, assess relevance, ID update/clarification needs. Monitor/incorporate new research (GDC, SIGGRAPH, AIIDE), major engine/influential publication updates.
*   Continuous Monitoring/Feedback: Foster culture: team members flag outdated info, errors, ambiguities during work. Simple feedback mechanism (7.2).
*   New Concept Integration: Clear workflow (propose, research, document, validate, integrate) for new techniques, significant algo variations, overlooked concepts. Follow P2-P5 rigor.
**7.2. Contribution & Feedback Model (Leverage collective team knowledge):**
*   Contribution Process: Clear guidelines/procedures for corrections, improvements, new entries (e.g., Git pull requests, wiki edit suggestions, dedicated submission form).
*   Review & Approval: All contributions undergo P5-like validation (peer review by domain experts, core maintenance team) before merge. Ensures quality/consistency.
*   Feedback Mechanism: User-friendly way for feedback, error reports, questions (e.g., integrated comments on repo platform, dedicated email alias, specific team comms channel). Regularly review/act on feedback.
**7.3. Versioning & Changelog (Clear change history):**
*   Version Control: Utilize chosen repo platform's built-in (e.g., Git). All changes committed w/ descriptive messages.
*   Changelog: Publicly accessible; summarizes significant updates, additions, corrections, deprecations. Transparency, shows resource evolution.
Structured approach ensures KB remains reliable, up-to-date, evolving asset.
