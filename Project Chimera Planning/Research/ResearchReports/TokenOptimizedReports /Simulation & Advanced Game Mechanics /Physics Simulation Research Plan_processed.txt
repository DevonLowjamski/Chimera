**Research Plan: Development of Physics Simulations**

**Core Concept:** Physics simulations: indispensable 'third pillar' (theory, experimentation) for scientific inquiry/engineering. Model complex systems computationally; investigate inaccessible/expensive/dangerous phenomena. Scales: quantum to astrophysics. HPC expands scope/fidelity. Development complex, needs methodical, rigorous approach. This plan guides development: conception to implementation, validation, application. Stages: literature review, objective definition, model/method selection, implementation, V&V, data management, application ID, challenge mitigation. Based on computational science/engineering best practices.

**1. Literature Review**
*   **Objective:** Understand state-of-the-art in domain; ID knowledge gaps/limitations; prevent redundancy; inform subsequent stages (objectives, scope).
*   **Methodology:** Systematic approach.
    *   **Define Search Scope:** Articulate physical phenomena, scale (quantum, atomistic, mesoscopic, continuum), potential application areas.
    *   **Identify Key Databases/Resources:**
        *   Core/Multidisciplinary: Scopus, Web of Science (Dimensions: wider journal coverage; Web of Science: more selective).
        *   Preprint Archives: arXiv (latest physics, math, CS; subject sections e.g., physics.comp-ph, cond-mat, hep-ph, cs.CE; daily abstracts).
        *   Specialized: Astrophysics Data System (ADS), INSPIRE-HEP (high-energy physics).
        *   Engineering/CS: ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, CiteSeerX (algorithms, software, computational methodologies).
        *   Alerts: Scopus, Web of Science for new relevant work.
    *   **Refine Search Strategy:** Keywords: physics domain, models (e.g., "Navier-Stokes equations", "Density Functional Theory"), methods ("Finite Element Method", "Molecular Dynamics", "Lattice Boltzmann Method", "Monte Carlo simulation"), software ("OpenFOAM simulation", "LAMMPS potential", "FEniCS"), application ("plasma simulation", "material fracture"). Boolean operators.
    *   **Systematic Review Approach:** For established areas: explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria, thematic analysis. Identify: key prior studies, physical models (justification, assumptions, limitations), computational methods/algorithms/software, validation strategies/accuracy, challenges/unresolved issues, theoretical frameworks, experimental/observational data sources.
    *   **Critical Evaluation:** Assess paper quality, rigor, relevance, limitations. Focus: validation procedures, result/uncertainty reporting transparency. Understand method evolution.
    *   **Synthesize Findings:** Organize thematically. ID influential researchers/groups, seminal publications, debates, unanswered questions. Meticulous documentation (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley). Basis for objectives/scope.
*   **Deliverable:** Comprehensive literature review report: summarizes current knowledge, IDs research gap, justifies project novelty/relevance/contribution. Well-formatted bibliography.
*   **Notes:** Review why models/methods chosen, evolution, performance, limitations (historical context). Distinguish mature vs. experimental techniques. ML integration: search CS/ML venues (ACM, IEEE, arXiv: cs.LG, stat.ML) for algorithms, data analysis, hybrid modeling. arXiv: latest research, but no peer review; requires higher critical scrutiny (methodology, validation, reliability) - trade-off: currency vs. validated results.

**2. Defining Clear Objectives and Scope**
*   **Objective:** Translate gaps/goals into concrete, actionable plan. Objectives: what simulation achieves. Scope: boundaries. Align with broader scientific/engineering needs, manage stakeholder expectations.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   **State Overall Goals:** High-level purpose. Connect to context (fundamental science, engineering challenge, new computational capability). Justify effort/resources.
    *   **Define Specific Objectives (SMART):** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. E.g., "predict turbulent kinetic energy profile, channel flow, Re=10^5, accuracy Â±5% vs. data X, 12 months." Consider intended use ("throw-away" vs. robust predictive/design model).
    *   **Determine Scope:**
        *   Breadth (System Boundaries): Delineate included parts vs. boundary conditions/neglected. Driven by objectives (model only influential components). List exclusions.
        *   Depth (Level of Detail/Resolution): Granularity ("black box" vs. high-fidelity). Depends on objectives, precision. Trade-off: detail vs. dev/validation/computation effort.
        *   Physics Included/Excluded: State laws/effects (relativistic, interatomic forces, radiative heat, turbulence models) incorporated/approximated/ignored. Justify.
    *   **Identify Constraints:**
        *   Time: Deadlines, personnel, phase durations (model building up to 50% project time).
        *   Budget: Funds for software, HPC, hardware, personnel.
        *   Resources: Access to hardware (GPUs, memory, HPC clusters), software, expertise (parallel programming, physics domain).
        *   Data Availability: Limits on input data (parameters, IC/BC) or validation experimental data.
    *   **Define Deliverables:** Concrete outputs (code, validated model, datasets, reports, visualizations, software docs).
    *   **Establish Key Milestones:** Major phases, time-bound milestones. Facilitates tracking.
    *   **List Assumptions:** Underlying assumptions (physical system, environment, model applicability, external factors). Clarifies context, limitations.
    *   **Obtain Stakeholder Agreement:** Communicate objectives, scope, constraints, deliverables to stakeholders (advisors, funders, collaborators, PMs). Formal agreement prevents "scope creep," ensures shared understanding.
*   **Conceptual Tool:** Object-objective abstractness diagram: plots project (object abstractness: real system vs. idealized model e.g., Lennard-Jones fluid; objective abstractness: technical validation vs. exploratory investigation). Clarifies project position, epistemic aims.
*   **Deliverable:** Formal Project Scope Statement / Simulation Specification document: SMART objectives, scope (breadth, depth, physics incl./excl.), constraints (time, budget, resources, data), deliverables, milestones, assumptions, stakeholder concurrence (sign-off).
*   **Notes:** Scope: trade-off management (realism/accuracy vs. time/budget/compute). Avoid over-scoping. Limit complexity by objectives/constraints. "Intended use" influences rigor (exploratory vs. critical design/safety). Explicitly define exclusions.

**3. Identifying and Selecting Physical Models**
*   **Objective:** Select mathematical representations (governing equations, constitutive relations, approximations) for system behavior. Capture essential physics for objectives (Step 2) with sufficient fidelity, computationally tractable.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   **Identify Governing Physics:** Based on objectives/scope, ID principles (fluid dynamics, solid/quantum/classical mechanics, EM, thermo, stat mech).
    *   **Explore Model Hierarchy:** Multiple description levels (quantum -> atomistic (MD) -> coarse-grained -> continuum (fluid/solid mechanics)). Determine level(s) by phenomena, resolution, feasibility. E.g., material fracture: MD to FEM.
    *   **Survey Potential Models:** Within domain/level, ID candidates (e.g., Navier-Stokes vs. LBM for fluid flow; DFT vs. empirical potentials for materials; k-epsilon vs. k-omega SST for CFD turbulence). Consult literature (Step 1).
    *   **Evaluate Model Fidelity vs. Cost:**
        *   High-Fidelity: Detailed physics, higher accuracy/realism. Greater compute resources, complex implementation. May be unsuitable for real-time/limited hardware (HIL).
        *   Low-Fidelity: Simplifications reduce cost/complexity. Faster, easier integration, lower accuracy.
        *   Multi-Fidelity Modeling: Combine LFM/HFM info. LFM speed for exploration/baseline, sparse HFM data for correction/calibration. Techniques: co-Kriging, correction (additive, multiplicative), space mapping, multi-level MC, physics-informed ML. Effectiveness depends on LFM-HFM correlation. Continuous fidelity possible (e.g., mesh as parameter).
    *   **Consider Model Assumptions/Limitations:** Models are approximations, rest on assumptions (e.g., neglect relativistic, material homogeneity, ideal gas, Born-Oppenheimer). Document assumptions, validity conditions. Impacts interpretation, applicability, uncertainty.
    *   **Assess Availability of Parameters:** Model parameters (material constants, reaction rates) known/obtainable (literature, theory, experiment)? Unknown/uncertain params may be sub-project, influence choice, link to data (Step 7), UQ (Step 6).
    *   **Select and Justify:** Select model(s). Document reasoning, trade-offs, rejected alternatives.
*   **Deliverable:** Detailed description of selected model(s). Justification, fidelity/cost analysis, assumptions, limitations.
*   **Notes:** Selection often hierarchical/multi-fidelity. Simpler models for exploration, sensitivity, reducing HFM burden. LFM-HFM correlation key. Simplifications/assumptions -> "model form uncertainty" (distinct from numerical/input U). Plan quantification in validation (Step 6). PIML (PINNs, PhIK) integrates physical laws into ML; advantages (complex geometries, data), challenges (training, stability at discontinuities, interpretability, validation), needs interdisciplinary expertise.

**4. Choosing Computational Methods and Algorithms**
*   **Objective:** Select numerical techniques to solve physical model equations. Discretization, algebraic solving, time advancement. Consider accuracy, stability, efficiency, problem specifics (geometry, linearity, discontinuities/shocks).
*   **Methodology:**
    *   **Identify Mathematical Problem Type:** Equations (Step 3): PDEs (elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic), ODEs, integral, systems? Linear/nonlinear? Initial/boundary value, eigenvalue? Guides method selection.
    *   **Survey Discretization Methods:**
        *   FDM: Taylor series on structured grid. Simple (regular geom). Accuracy: grid, difference order.
        *   FEM: Domain into elements, basis functions. Good for complex geom/BCs. Solid mechanics, EM.
        *   FVM: Integrate over control volumes. Ensures discrete conservation. Good for fluid dynamics (shocks), unstructured meshes.
        *   LBM: Mesoscopic, particle distribution functions on lattice. Recovers macroscopic fluid dynamics. Good for complex geom (porous media), easy BCs. Parallelizable. Avoids pressure Poisson eq. Memory intensive.
        *   SPH: Mesh-free Lagrangian, particles. Good for free surfaces, large deformations. Robust, potentially lower accuracy/higher cost.
        *   Particle Methods (MD, MC): MD: Newton's eq for atoms (nanoscale). MC: random sampling (stat mech, stochastic).
    *   **Select Solvers:** For algebraic systems.
        *   Linear: Direct (Gaussian elim, LU) for small/dense. Iterative (Jacobi, CG, GMRES) for large/sparse; need preconditioners. PETSc.
        *   Nonlinear: Iterative (Newton, fixed-point). Each step often solves linear system.
        *   Time Integration (time-dependent): Explicit (Euler, RK): future from current/past. Simpler, conditionally stable (\Delta t limit, e.g., CFL). Implicit (Backward Euler, Crank-Nicolson): future in calculation, solve system/step. More stable, larger \Delta t (stiff problems), higher cost/step.
    *   **Consider Accuracy and Stability:** Method formal accuracy order. Stability paramount. Stability analysis (e.g., von Neumann) for limits. Convergence = consistency + stability.
    *   **Evaluate Computational Cost:** Resources: FLOPs, memory. Scaling. Parallel suitability (Step 5). Locality key.
    *   **Algorithm Selection and Justification:** Select combination. Document rationale (model, problem, accuracy, stability, resources).
*   **Deliverable:** Description/justification of methods/algorithms: discretization, solvers, time integration. Accuracy, stability, computational characteristics.
