Critical gaps:
- Precise infection mechanisms for some viruses not fully elucidated.22
- Epidemiology of many pathogens (role of seed transmission, spread from adjacent crops) needs further investigation.1
- Management strategies (esp. viral diseases) limited; effective treatments lacking for many viral infections.22
- Challenging pathogens (Fusarium, Botrytis; significant losses) need more research on effective control.1
- Lack of registered fungicides for Cannabis (except specific products e.g., vaporized sulfur for powdery mildew) is significant limitation.1 Regulatory constraint -> emphasis on biological/cultural control, host resistance research.1
- Registered biological control agents: comprehensive efficacy data/field evaluations often lacking in peer-reviewed literature.1
- Preharvest UV-C treatment effect on mold growth/cannabinoid levels: further study.1
- Identifying/characterizing Cannabis genotypes resistant to major pathogens (Fusarium, powdery mildew, Botrytis, viruses): long-term priority; needs accurate screening methods, molecular characterization.1
- Role of resident microbes (endophytes) in Cannabis (beneficial/detrimental effects on disease, cannabinoid profiles): warrants rigorous experimentation.1
Addressing gaps crucial for sustainable/effective disease management, ensuring product quality/safety. Regulatory landscape influences available tools; researchers must be mindful.35

5. Advanced Methodologies for Detection, Analysis, and Monitoring of Cannabis Pathogens and Viruses
Crucial: accurate/timely detection, comprehensive analysis, effective monitoring for managing Cannabis diseases/pathogens/viruses.
Diagnostic tools (strengths/limitations):

  - qPCR: Quantifies pathogen load, insights into infection severity.16
  - Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS): High-throughput; identifies multiple/novel pathogens; comprehensive profiling.20
  - Serological assays (e.g., ImmunoStrips): Rapid, on-site detection (specific pathogen proteins).18
  - Traditional culturing: Valuable for isolating/studying pathogens; slower, less sensitive than molecular.41
Robust, early detection protocols essential (indoor, greenhouse, outdoor farms). Systematic testing: incoming plant material (e.g., HLVd), regular mother plant monitoring critical for disease prevention/spread.29 Systematic program aspects: pre-labeling sample bags (plant ID, location), sterile sampling, detailed records.29 Sample pooling: cost vs. accuracy trade-off; individual testing for highest accuracy.29 Commercial diagnostic kits available (viruses, viroids, fungi, bacteria).18
Effective surveillance/monitoring programs: track disease prevalence/spread (facility to regional scale). Comprehensive surveillance system: integrate data (in-house/external lab tests, grower reports).47 Remote sensing (aerial/satellite imagery): potential for large-scale outdoor outbreak monitoring (emerging research). Data analytics/GIS: analyze disease patterns, identify hotspots, predict outbreaks; inform proactive management/interventions.47

6. Development of Potential Control and Prevention Strategies
Paramount: effective control/prevention strategies for safeguarding Cannabis crops (biological, chemical, cultural).
6.1. Biological Control: Sustainable, environmentally conscious approach for pest/pathogen management.1 Utilizes living organisms/naturally derived substances to suppress populations.
  - Beneficial microbes (e.g., Trichoderma, Bacillus spp.): Promise for controlling fungal diseases (root rots, powdery mildew).4 Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp.: biocontrol activity against Botrytis cinerea (gray mold).58
  - Predatory insects/mites (e.g., ladybugs, lacewings, Phytoseiulus persimilis): Prey on pests (aphids, spider mites, thrips - potential pathogen vectors).54
  - Entomopathogenic nematodes (e.g., Steinernema feltiae): Control soil-dwelling pests (fungus gnat larvae, root aphids).54
Environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic pesticides.32 More research needed: most effective agents, optimized application.1 Influencing factors: plant morphology, biochemistry, supplemental lighting.34
6.2. Chemical Control: Pesticides, fungicides, bactericides; judicious use due to regulatory restrictions, environmental implications.35
  - Federal Schedule I classification: lack of EPA-registered pesticides for Cannabis.35
  - Growers adhere to state-specific regulations: vary significantly (allowable pesticides, testing requirements).36
  - Many jurisdictions: only organic/biorational products permitted (e.g., neem oil, insecticidal soaps, potassium bicarbonate, hydrogen peroxide).5 Sulfur-based fungicides often allowed (powdery mildew).5
  - Necessary chemical controls: select approved products, follow label instructions, consider residues.36
Research focus: identify/evaluate safety/efficacy of approved products for specific Cannabis diseases/pests.
6.3. Cultural Control: Cornerstone of disease prevention; central research/grower education focus.4
  - Strict sanitation protocols: essential to minimize pathogen introduction/spread (clean/disinfect tools, equipment, facilities).32
  - Optimal environmental conditions: (temperature, humidity, airflow) significantly impact disease development.4
  - Proper irrigation: crucial to avoid overwatering (favorable for root diseases).4
  - Disease-resistant Cannabis cultivars: proactive approach to minimize disease incidence.1
  - Crop rotation (where applicable): disrupt soilborne pathogen life cycles.4
  - Quarantine new plant material: (isolate, observe, test) prevent pest/disease introduction.32
Research focus: optimize cultural practices for Cannabis cultivation, create environment less conducive to disease.

7. Recommendations for Experimental Designs and Field Studies to Advance Knowledge
Essential for advancing understanding/developing robust management: rigorous experimental designs, well-controlled field studies.
