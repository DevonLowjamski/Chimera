**1. Intro: Advancing Cannabis Cultivation via Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)**
*   Cannabis sativa: cultivation transforming (therapeutic, recreational, industrial potential).
*   Traditional methods (outdoor/greenhouse): weather-susceptible, seasonal, pest/disease challenges.
*   CEA: technology-intensive; unprecedented control (temp, light, humidity, CO2, nutrients).
*   CEA defined: enclosed plant cultivation; meticulous environmental regulation/optimization for superior growth, quality, production efficiency. Integrates engineering, plant science, computer-managed controls.
*   CEA market growth drivers: consumer demand (healthy/local food), climate change, ag-tech advancements (esp. cheaper energy-efficient LEDs).
*   CEA for cannabis: precise yield optimization; targeted cannabinoid/terpene manipulation; enhanced quality/consistency; improved resource use/sustainability; mitigated environmental impact.
*   Research plan purpose: rigorous framework for systematic investigation/optimization of CEA for Cannabis sativa.

**2. Review: Current CEA Practices for Cannabis**
*   Facility Types:
    *   Fully enclosed indoor farms: total isolation/control; artificial light; year-round. Precise manipulation: photoperiod, light spectrum, temp, humidity, CO2.
    *   Hybrid greenhouses: primary natural sunlight; supplemental artificial light (esp. LEDs) for seasonal/spectral needs. Environmental controls (temp, humidity, ventilation). More controlled than outdoor; leverages sunlight.
*   Soilless Cultivation (advantages: precise nutrient delivery, resource efficiency):
    *   Hydroponics: roots in/exposed to nutrient-rich water. Systems: Deep Water Culture (DWC) (roots in oxygenated solution); Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) (shallow, continuous solution flow over roots); Ebb & Flow (Flood/Drain) (root zone periodically flooded/drained).
    *   Aeroponics: roots suspended in air, misted with nutrient solution. Max O2/nutrient exposure; rapid growth, efficient resource use.
*   Environmental Control Tech/Strategies:
    *   Lighting: critical all stages (seedling-flower, cannabinoid/terpene synthesis). Advanced LEDs > HPS (energy efficiency, customizable spectrum, low heat -> reduced cooling).
    *   Temp/Humidity: precise levels crucial; optimal ranges vary (veg vs. flower). Impact development, mold/mildew prevention. HVACD systems essential.
    *   CO2 enrichment: boosts photosynthesis (faster growth, biomass, yield; esp. veg/flower). Via CO2 generators/compressed tanks.
    *   Airflow/Ventilation: uniform temp/humidity/CO2; prevents microclimates; mitigates pest/disease. Fans/ventilation.
*   Knowledge Gaps/Innovation Opportunities:
    *   No standardized HVAC designs for indoor cannabis challenges.
    *   Needed: research on dynamic light spectrum recipes (growth stages) for yield, specific phytochemicals, resource efficiency.
    *   Scarcity of public, objective commercial cannabis CEA data (historical illicit status).
