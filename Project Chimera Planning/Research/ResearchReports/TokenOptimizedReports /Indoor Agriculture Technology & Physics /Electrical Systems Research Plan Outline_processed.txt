II. Foundational Physics: Electricity and Magnetism
Electrical systems rooted in fundamental electricity/magnetism principles.
Electric Charge/Force: Electric charge: intrinsic property, positive/negative, conserved (transferable). Coulomb's Law: electrostatic force (F) between point charges (q₁, q₂) distance (r) apart: F = k|q₁q₂|/r² (k=Coulomb's constant). Force: attractive (opposite), repulsive (like); fundamental to atomic/molecular structure.
Electric Fields (\vec{E}): Influence of charges on space. Charge creates \vec{E}; \vec{E} exerts force (\vec{F}) on charge (q): \vec{F} = q\vec{E}. Replaces action-at-a-distance. \vec{E} calculable for charge configurations (point, line, surface, volume) via integration. Field lines: visualize direction (tangent), strength (density). Electric dipole: two equal/opposite charges, small separation; behavior in external fields (torque, potential energy) key for dielectric polarization.
Gauss's Law: Electric flux (\Phi_E): \vec{E} through surface. Gauss's Law (1st Maxwell's eq): net \Phi_E through closed surface ("Gaussian surface") to enclosed charge (Q_enc): \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = Q_enc/\epsilon_0 (\epsilon_0=permittivity of free space). Calculates \vec{E} in high symmetry (spherical, cylindrical, planar). Conductors (electrostatic equilibrium): \vec{E} inside=0; net charge on surface; \vec{E} outside perpendicular to surface.
Electric Potential: Electric potential energy (U): charge's energy by position in \vec{E}. Electric potential (V, voltage): U/q. Potential difference (\Delta V): work/unit charge to move charge; crucial in circuits. V calculable; point charge V=kq/r. \vec{E} related to V: \vec{E} points in direction of most rapid V decrease (\vec{E}=-\nabla V). Equipotential surfaces: constant V, perpendicular to \vec{E} lines.
Magnetism/Magnetic Fields (\vec{B}): Sources: permanent magnets, moving charges (currents). Create \vec{B} (vector fields). No observed magnetic monopoles. \vec{B} lines: visualize; always closed loops (N to S pole externally). Gauss's Law for Magnetism (2nd Maxwell's eq): net \Phi_B through any closed surface=0: \oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} = 0.
Magnetic Forces: \vec{B} exert forces on moving charges/currents. Lorentz force: \vec{F} on charge (q) velocity (\vec{v}) in \vec{E}, \vec{B}: \vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}). Magnetic component: perpendicular to \vec{v}, \vec{B}; causes circular/helical paths. Current-carrying conductor in \vec{B}: net force \vec{F} = I \int d\vec{l} \times \vec{B} (motors, loudspeakers). Parallel currents attract; antiparallel repel (Ampere definition basis). Current loop in uniform \vec{B}: no net force, experiences torque aligning magnetic dipole moment with \vec{B} (drives motors). Hall Effect: transverse voltage in current-carrying conductor in \vec{B}; determines charge carrier sign/density.
Sources of Magnetic Fields: \vec{B} from currents. Biot-Savart Law: \vec{B} contribution (d\vec{B}) from current segment (d\vec{l}): d\vec{B} = (\mu_0/4\pi) (I d\vec{l} \times \hat{r})/r² (\mu_0=permeability of free space). Integrable for wire configurations. Ampere's Law (original): \oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0 I_enc (I_enc=net current through Amperian loop). Useful for high symmetry (long wires, coax, solenoids, toroids). Solenoids (cylindrical coils), toroids (donut coils): strong, uniform \vec{B}; basis for inductors, electromagnets.
Electromagnetic Induction: Faraday: changing magnetic flux (\Phi_B) through wire loop induces EMF (\mathcal{E}). Faraday's Law: \mathcal{E} = -N (d\Phi_B/dt) (N=turns). \Phi_B change via: \vec{B} strength, loop area, orientation. Fundamental to generators, transformers, induction cooktops, wireless charging. Lenz's Law (- sign): induced EMF/current opposes \Phi_B change (energy conservation). Motional EMF: in conductor moving in stationary \vec{B} (\mathcal{E}=Blv for conductor L, vel v, perp to \vec{B}). Changing \vec{B} induces non-conservative \vec{E}. Eddy currents: circulating currents in bulk conductor from changing \Phi_B; dissipate energy (Joule heating - induction heating/furnaces), cause braking/losses (transformers, motors).
Maxwell's Equations: Classical EM culmination.
1. Gauss's Law (Electricity): \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = Q_enc/\epsilon_0 (\vec{E} to charge sources)
2. Gauss's Law (Magnetism): \oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} = 0 (no magnetic monopoles)
3. Faraday's Law: \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = -d\Phi_B/dt (changing \Phi_B creates \vec{E})
4. Ampere-Maxwell Law: \oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0 I_enc + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 (d\Phi_E/dt) (currents & changing \vec{E} create \vec{B})
Integral/differential forms. Unify electricity, magnetism, light. Predict EM waves at c=1/\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0} (speed of light). Light=EM wave; spectrum radio-gamma. Bedrock for classical electrical/optical tech.

Gauss B: \oint_S \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} = 0 | \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0 | \vec{B} lines continuous loops; no magnetic monopoles.
Faraday: \oint_C \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = -(d/dt) \int_S \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} | \nabla \times \vec{E} = -\partial \vec{B}/\partial t | Changing \Phi_B induces EMF (\vec{E}).
Ampere-Maxwell: \oint_C \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0 I_enc + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 (d\Phi_E/dt) | \nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 (\partial \vec{E}/\partial t) | Currents & changing \vec{E} produce \vec{B}.
