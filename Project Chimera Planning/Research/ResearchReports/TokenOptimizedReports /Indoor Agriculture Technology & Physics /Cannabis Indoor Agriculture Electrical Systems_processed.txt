**Principles & Physics of Electrical Systems:**
Fundamental electrical principles essential for design, operation, optimization.
Ohm's Law (V=IR): cornerstone circuit design, safety analysis (calc. current for high-wattage grow lights; ensure appropriate wiring/circuit protection).
Electrical Power (P=VI): rate of electrical energy transfer; crucial for energy management, cost analysis (determine consumption: lights (100s-1000s W), HVAC, other equip for electrical service capacity design).
AC power: most common. DC conversion (e.g., LEDs w/ direct DC): potential efficiency improvements.
Three-phase power: advantages for large-scale ops (significant power demands, heavy-duty equip efficiency).
Power Quality:
*   Power Factor (PF): real power / apparent power; impacts energy losses, increased costs if low. Low PF from electronic ballasts, some LED drivers; necessitates PF correction research/implementation.
*   Harmonics: sinusoidal waveforms at multiples of fundamental frequency; introduced by non-linear loads (electronic power supplies, VFDs). High levels cause equip overheating/malfunction; ID/mitigation important.
Physics of Light:
*   Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR): light wavelengths plants use for photosynthesis.
*   Metrics: PPF (Photosynthetic Photon Flux), PPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density) - critical for lighting system optimization.
*   Wavelength effects: blue/red light have varying effects on plant development; select optimal light spectrum per growth stage.
*   Light intensity (PPFD): essential for maximizing photosynthesis without plant stress.
*   Heat transfer (from lighting/electrical equip): significantly impacts grow room env., cooling energy. Lighting tech w/ lower heat (e.g., LEDs) crucial for energy efficiency.
Physics of Environmental Control:
*   Thermodynamics: governs heat transfer, air movement.
*   Psychrometrics: study of air-water vapor mixtures (humidity control).
*   Plant transpiration: influences grow room thermodynamics (adds moisture, affects cooling loads).
*   Fluid dynamics: relevant to airflow patterns (temp/humidity uniformity, plant health).
*   HVAC systems: must manage sensible/latent heat loads for optimal growing conditions.
