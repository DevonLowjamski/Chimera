**Cannabis sativa Flavonoids:**  Focus on cannflavins (prenylated/geranylated flavones unique to C. sativa, except cannflavin A also in *Mimulus bigelovii*).  Entourage effect (synergistic bioactivities of phytocannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids) understudied.

**Cannflavin Biosynthesis:**  Core flavonoid skeleton via phenylpropanoid pathway (PAL, 4CL, CHS, CHI, FNS, F3'H).  Cannflavins A & B from luteolin via CsOMT21 (3'-O methylation to chrysoeriol) and CsPT3 (geranyl/prenyl addition).  Tissue-specific distribution (absent in roots, seeds); production varies with development, environment (temperature, solar radiation, rainfall, humidity, altitude).

**Cannflavin Bioactivities:**  Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory (inhibits PGE2 synthase-1, 5-lipoxygenase; 30x more effective than aspirin in inhibiting PGE2 release; weak COX-1/COX-2 inhibition). Neuroprotective (cannflavin A enhances PC12 cell viability against Aβ-induced cytotoxicity). Anticancer (isocannflavin B suppresses T47-D cell proliferation, increases apoptosis in Panc-02, KPC cells; delays tumor progression in mice). Antiparasitic (cannflavins A & B against *Leishmania donovani*, *Trypanosoma brucei brucei*; cannflavin A docking to *L. donovani* pteridine reductase 1). Antiviral (cannflavin A docking to HIV-1 protease, Dengue virus envelope protein, Zika virus proteins – helicase, methyltransferase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). Microbial metabolism by *Mucor ramannianus*, *Beauveria bassiana* yields inactive metabolites. Structure-function relationship of prenylation/geranylation needs further study; human drug metabolism unclear.

**C. sativa Biotechnology:** Draft genome (2011), high-quality reference genome (2020; 83 Mb, N50 = 513.57 kb, 38,828 protein-coding genes).  Transcriptome sequencing data (NCBI SRA, 59 bioprojects; 37 with genome/transcriptome sequences).  Gene discovery (prenyltransferase, methyltransferase).  Transcriptome, metabolome, proteome integration to elucidate flavonoid regulation.  Overexpression of biosynthetic/regulatory genes to increase flavonoid accumulation; cell suspension, hairy root cultures, heterologous expression systems for production.


**Future Directions:**  Investigate flavonoid response to biotic/abiotic stress; identify regulatory factors (transcription factors, miRNAs). Reconstruct cannflavin pathway in plant cultures/heterologous systems; increase carbon flux to flavonoid pathway; scale up production for preclinical/clinical studies to elucidate bioactivities and entourage effect.
