**Cannabis Plant Origins:** Central Asia (Pleistocene glaciations, ~1800 years ago). Four varieties: *C. sativa* (Black Sea region, tall, long flowering, diverse terpenoids), *C. indica* (China, short, fast flowering, high THC), *C. ruderalis* (autoflowering), *C. afghanica* (high-altitude, high-heat, hashish production, unique traits).  Hybrids combine *sativa* and *indica*; autoflowering hybrids use *ruderalis*. Trichome maturity (clear, cloudy, amber) influences effects (euphoric vs. sedative).

**Getting Started:** Home hydroponic marijuana cultivation requires space, equipment (lights, circulation, growing media, watering systems), and nutrient solutions.  Space considerations include grow room (larger) and growing environment (smaller, controlled). Electrical upgrades may be necessary.

**Growing Marijuana:**  Cultivar selection considers mature size, potency, flavor, appearance. Sourcing: seeds (bag seed, F1 hybrids), cuttings (risk of contamination). Quarantine new plants.  Plant parts: fan leaves, sugar leaves, mature flower bud (female), male flower, trichomes. Life cycle: germination, vegetative growth (seedling, starts, mature), flowering, processing, curing.

**Plant Growth Stages:** Germination (75-90°F, 86°F optimal, high humidity); paper towel or propagation dome methods. Vegetative stages: Seedling (cotyledons to second true leaves, water only), Second (third set of true leaves to flowering maturity, half-strength nutrient solution initially, then full-strength with 4-3-3 N-P-K ratio), Third (minimum flowering maturity, maintained with 24-hour light or 18/6 photoperiod). Flowering (12/12 photoperiod, 75°F, 50% RH, increase airflow, higher light intensity, support top-heavy plants).  Re-vegging: harvest, leave bottom quarter, nitrogen-dominant nutrient solution, 24-hour (or 18/6) light. Mothering/cloning: FIM or pinching to trigger branching; sterile equipment; rooting gel (IBA, NAA); 10-21 days for rooting; foliar feeding until roots develop; regular pruning; replace mothers periodically.

**Environmental Factors:** Water (pH 5.8-6.2, EC/PPM, temperature 60-80°F, oxygenation – “Sprite” look). Nutrient availability (macronutrients: N, P, K, Ca, S; micronutrients: Mg, Fe, Mn, B, Zn, Cu, Mo, Cl; synthetic, organic, or hybrid solutions). Light (lumens/foot-candles, 400-700 nm PAR, color temperature, HID (HPS, MH), fluorescent (T5VHO optimal), CFL, avoid light stress). Temperature (68-75°F, air cooling preferred, tepid nutrient solution). Humidity (40-60% RH, dehumidifiers/humidifiers). CO2 and circulation (300-400 ppm naturally, 1300-1500 ppm enhanced, interval circulation for enhancement).

**Growing Media:** Water-to-air ratio, water retention, nutrient retention, pH sustainability, capillary effect. Types: sand, gravel, perlite, rock wool, expanded clay pellets, coco coir, compressed bark, low-density high-drainage foam. Soilless Pro-Mix (custom blends). Water culture: no growing medium, aeration/circulation essential.

**Watering Systems:** Hand-watering (small scale), drip irrigation (all scales), wick technique (single plants), deep water culture (small to medium), subirrigation (flood and drain, automated), gutter systems, drip gutter.

**Growing Environment:** Electrical requirements (upgrade circuits if necessary), safety (fire extinguishers, smoke detectors), vestibule (clean clothes), air conditioning (12000 BTU for 10x12ft room, exhaust/intake fans as alternative), CO2 enhancement (quick-release, burner systems – water-cooled optimal). Reproduction environment: grow tent or DIY closet. Circulation systems: simple, air-cooled lighting, closed-loop, water-cooled.

**Creating a Nutrient Solution:** Macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, S – symptoms of deficiency/overdose and correction methods), micronutrients (Mg, Fe, Mn, B, Zn, Cu, Mo, Cl – symptoms and causes of deficiencies). Supplements/additives: correct deficiencies, achieve specific effects. Feed charts: track nutrient amounts, timing, ratios, EC/PPM, additives. Formulating: base nutrient solution, supplements for entire cycle, grow/bloom stages, specific times. Mixing: fill reservoir with tepid water, calculate dosages, add nutrients (K-P-N order), mix, check/adjust pH and EC.  Feeding schedules: vegetative (nitrogen-dominant), flowering (phosphorus-dominant), flush (clean water or carbohydrate additive).

**Production Techniques:** Single chamber (simple, flexible), staggered chambers (multiple harvests), dedicated chambers (separate veg/flower). Plant care: vertical/horizontal trellising (maximize light, increase branching), bending (increase branching, maximize space), staking (increase branching, shorten plants). Combination techniques.

**Pest Management & Troubleshooting:** Fungal infection (control with soaps/oils/horticultural oil), pest prevention (seed starting, clean tools/clothes), IPM (cultural, mechanical, biological, chemical controls), common pests (aphids, fungus gnats, spider mites – identification, life cycles, control methods).

**Harvest & Ingestion:** Harvest timing (capitate trichome maturity: clear, cloudy, amber), harvesting (cut plants, trim leaves), drying (75°F, 50% RH, 8-14 days, stem snap test), curing (sealed jars, 4-hour cycles). Ingestion methods: smoking (dried flower, kief, hashish, hydrocarbon extractions), ingestion (pills, tinctures, edibles).  Hydrocarbon extractions: oils, shatters, waxes (purging techniques). Edibles: cannabis butter, pills, tinctures.
