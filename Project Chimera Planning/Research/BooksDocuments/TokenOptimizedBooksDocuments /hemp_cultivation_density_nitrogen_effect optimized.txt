Dual-purpose hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) cultivation study: Futura 75 & Bialobrzeskie cultivars across 8 European environments (2013-2015).

Stem yield (1.3–22.3 Mg ha⁻¹):
* Planting density (30–120 plants m⁻²): +29% yield.  >120 plants m⁻²: no significant increase.
* Nitrogen fertilization (0–60 kg N ha⁻¹): +32% yield. >60 kg N ha⁻¹: no significant increase.
* No significant interaction between density, fertilization, cultivar, or harvest time.

Seed yield (0.3–2.1 Mg ha⁻¹):
* Planting density (30–240 plants m⁻²): no significant effect.
* Nitrogen fertilization: increasing trend, but not statistically significant.

Recommended practices: 90–150 plants m⁻², 60 kg N ha⁻¹.  Further N optimization requires plant N status assessment.

Critical Nitrogen Dilution Curve (CNDC):
* Determined for hemp using data from Piacenza-IT & Budrio-IT (2015).
* Equation:  Ncritical (%) = { aW⁻ᵇ if W ≥ Wthreshold; Nconstant (%) if W < Wthreshold }
    * a = 3.26, b = 0.78, Wthreshold = 0.78 Mg ha⁻¹, Nconstant = 3.60%
* NNI (Nitrogen Nutrition Index) = N / Ncritical; NNI < 1: N limiting; NNI ≥ 1: N sufficient.
* NNIint (integrated NNI): considers deficiency duration & intensity.  Wrelative positively correlated with NNIint when NNIint < 1.

Plant Growth:
* Seedling emergence: 75–112 °Cd after sowing.
* Full flowering: 1150–1982 °Cd after sowing.
* High density/N: fast canopy closure (≈90% light interception).  Light extinction coefficient: 0.96.
* Plant height (55–312 cm), stem diameter (2.6–11.4 mm): negatively correlated with density, positively with N. Height & diameter exponential increase with Wstem.
* N uptake proportional to fertilization.  Nuptake:LAI ratio higher with fertilization. N decreased after flowering.
* Nleaf (1.5–2.6%), Nstem (0.5–0.7%), Nseed (2.7–4.0%) at seed maturity. N utilization efficiency (75.8–108.8 kg DM kg⁻¹ N).

Locations: Piacenza-IT, Budrio-IT (Italy), La Trugalle-FR (France), Šumperk-CZ (Czech Republic), Vilani-LV (Latvia) (2013–2015).  Varied latitude, temperature (14.9–21.8 °C), and precipitation (212–297 mm). Irrigation only in Piacenza-IT (120, 60, 155 mm in 2013, 2014, 2015, respectively).

Methods: Randomized complete block design, 4 replicates. Plot sizes: 42 m² (2 harvests), 60 m² (detailed growth analysis).  Sowing depth: 3–4 cm. Row spacing: 15–25 cm.  Hand-thinning at Piacenza-IT and Budrio-IT (30 and 60 plants m⁻² treatments). N fertilizer applied at sowing or after emergence.  Growth assessments: seedling emergence, flowering, biomass, plant height, stem diameter, stem/leaf/seed proportion, N concentration (Vario Max CN Analyzer). Light interception (ceptometer), LAI (ImageJ), SPAD (SPAD-502). Statistical analysis: mixed models (SPSS 22.0).

Discussion:
* Density effect limited due to self-thinning and hemp plasticity. Optimal density: 90-150 plants/m².
* N effect varies with environment. Deficiency reduces yield, but excess is undesirable (harvest difficulties, processing issues, environmental concerns).
* Hemp shows high N use efficiency, possibly due to low structural N and high leaf photosynthetic N use efficiency at low N.
* Direct NNI determination is impractical for farmers.  Indirect estimation using SPAD needs further investigation.

Conclusion: Optimal dual-purpose hemp production: 90–150 plants m⁻², 60 kg N ha⁻¹ (optimizable via plant N status assessment).  SPAD-based diagnosis needs further research.
