Plant Growth Stages: Seedling (young, vulnerable), Vegetative (leaf/stem growth), Flowering (bud production). Unique environmental/nutritional needs per stage.  Cannabis sativa classifications: sativa, indica, ruderalis, afghanica.  Each has unique growth patterns, appearance, aroma, taste, potency (THC/CBD ratio).  Hemp (Cannabis sativa) grown for fiber; low THC.  Ruderalis autoflowering; low THC. Afghanica short, broad leaves, dense buds; high cannabinoids.

Seeds: Genetic characteristics determined by parents. Mature seeds (hard, dark, mottled) germinate best (3-7 days, 70-90째F (21-32째C)). Immature seeds germinate poorly.  Germination requires water, heat, air (oxygen).  Scarification (sandpaper) may be needed for hard seeds. Germination techniques: pre-soaking (overnight), direct sowing (twice seed width deep).  Avoid soggy mediums.  Feed seedlings/clones 2-4 weeks after sprouting (quarter-strength solution). Grow more females from seed by: increasing N, decreasing K; low temps, high humidity; blue light, short days.

Vegetative Growth:  16-24 hours light daily. Roots: central (water transport, food storage), tip (elongation), hairs (water/nutrient absorption). Stem: elongation, bud/branch/leaf production; avoid tight binding. Leaves: photosynthesis (C02 + H20 + light energy -> carbohydrates + 02); keep stomata clean. Pre-flowering: 4th week of vegetative growth; male or female pre-flowers appear. Mother plants (2+ months old): consistent supply of clones. Cloning: branch tips, rooting (10-20 days), 18-24 hours light.  Increase P, decrease N. Avoid sprays. Embolisms prevented by immediate submersion.  pH 5-6.  Transplanting: minimal root disturbance, late in day, subdued light.  Harden-off gradually. Pruning: 45-degree angle cuts; remove dead leaves only. Avoid pruning before flowering.  Bending: alter hormone flow; tie branches horizontally. Air pruning: roots stop growing when exposed to air. Root pruning: remove roots to stimulate new growth. Grafting: possible (hops/cannabis), but no THC. Stress: reduces yield; can increase resin.

Flowering: 12 hours dark/ 12 hours light.  Growth shifts from leafy to floral.  Nutrient needs shift (less N, more P, K). Pre-flowers (male/female) appear 4th week vegetative growth. Males (low cannabinoids): remove before pollen shed. Females (high cannabinoids):  sinsemilla (unpollinated). Pollination: pollen (male) -> pistil (female) -> ovule -> seed. Seeds mature (6-8 weeks).  Male harvest: before pollen shed. Sinsemilla harvest: when trichomes are clear-milky (50%), amber (body stone). Harvest step-by-step: stop fertilizing (7-10 days before), flush (10-14 days before), total darkness (24 hours before), harvest in morning. Manicuring: remove leaves, stems (avoid petioles). Drying: slow (5-7 days, 65-75째F (18-24째C), 45-55% humidity), dark, minimum handling. Curing: slow drying (days to weeks); maintain microclimate, monitor moisture content.  Rejuvenation: leave lower branches, 18-hour light, high-N fertilizer.

Grow Rooms & Greenhouses: Basement/attic ideal.  Size determines lamp wattage (150-1100 W HID). Two rooms (vegetative/flowering) optimal. Perpetual harvest possible. Security: low profile, secrecy, avoid associating with growers.  Homeland Security Act and RICO laws impact personal rights. Thermal imaging: avoid heat loss, daytime grow lights. Greenhouses: extend growing season. Consider framing (wood/metal), coverings (glass/plastic/fiberglass), ventilation, heating/cooling (compost, electric, etc.), automatic darkening (12 hours). Security: camouflage.

Lighting: Light spectrum, intensity, photoperiod. PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) 400-700 nm.  Kelvin temperature (3000-6500 K).  Light meters measure foot-candles (fc)/lux. Inverse square law: intensity = 1/distance2.  Reflective hoods: horizontal most efficient.  No reflective hood: less efficient.  Air-cooled/water-cooled: reduce heat.  Plant spacing: ensure even light distribution. Rotate plants. Light movers: increase light intensity, even distribution. HID lights (Metal Halide, HPS): high lumen-per-watt. CFLs: efficient for seedlings/clones. Ballasts: regulate voltage, generate heat.

Soil & Containers: Soil texture (clay/sandy/loam).  pH (6.5-7.0).  Nutrient content.  Amendments (mineral/organic): perlite, pumice, vermiculite, coco coir, compost, manure.  Containers: size, shape, drainage.  Avoid potbound plants.  Double potting.  Raised beds.  Mulch.  Prevent/control grow medium problems.  CEC (cation exchange capacity).

Pests, Fungi & Diseases: Prevention (cleanliness), control (manual removal, organic sprays, biological control, chemicals). Insects: spider mites (stippling, webs), aphids (honeydew), fungus gnats, mealybugs/scales, leaf miners, caterpillars/loopers, beetle borers, slugs/snails, thrips, whiteflies.  Fungi: gray mold (Botrytis), damping-off (Pythium/Fusarium/Rhizoctonia), downy mildew, powdery mildew, blight, leaf spots, root rot, sooty mold, verticillium wilt.  Viruses.  Troubleshooting chart.  Sprays: contact sprays, organic (neem, pyrethrum, etc.), avoid systemic chemicals.

Hash & Oil Making: Hand rub, sieves (microns), Pollinator (motorized sieve), water hash (Ice-O-lator bags), washing machine hash.  Resin extraction for cooking (butter/oil).  Cannabis tinctures.  Volatile solvent extraction (not recommended).  Pressing hash (hand/mechanical).  Storing hash.
