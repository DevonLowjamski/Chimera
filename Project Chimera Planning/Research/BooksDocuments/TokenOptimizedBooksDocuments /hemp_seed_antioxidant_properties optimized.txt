**Study Objective:** Investigate nutritional, phytochemical, and antioxidant properties of 7 hemp cultivars (Santhica 27, Fedora 32, Felina 32, Futura 75, Tygra, Bialobrzeskie, Finola) grown in Greece for 3 years (2016-2018).

**Materials & Methods:** Seeds harvested;  proximate composition (AOAC); fatty acid composition (GC-FID, AOAC 996.06); tocopherols & carotenoids (HPLC); polyphenol extraction (80% aqueous methanol, 65°C); total phenolic content (Folin-Ciocalteu); phenolic acid composition (HPLC-DAD); antioxidant activity (ABTS, FRAP); statistical analysis (ANOVA, Tukey's test, Pearson correlation).  THC content <0.2% (EC Regulation 809/2014). Cultivar characteristics (Table 1); Climatic data (Table 2).

**Results:**

* **Nutritional Components (Figure 1, Table 3):**  Oil (8.5-29.2 g/100g), protein (12.2-25.4 g/100g), ash (4.4-5.3 g/100g), carbohydrates (40.8-74.5 g/100g).  Genotype significantly affects oil, protein, carbohydrate content; year significantly affects all. Finola highest oil & protein.

* **Fatty Acid Profile (Table 4, Table 3):**  SFA (palmitic 7.1-9.1%, stearic 2.1-2.8%); MUFA (oleic 10.3-17.9%); PUFA (linoleic 51.6-54.2%, α-linolenic 10.5-15.3%, γ-linolenic 1.9-5.0%). ω-6/ω-3 ratio 3.9-4.9. Genotype strongly affects fatty acid composition. Finola lowest ω-6/ω-3.

* **Tocopherols & Carotenoids (Table 5, Table 3):** γ-tocopherol (4.6-11.3 mg/100g), δ-tocopherol (0.6-1.3 mg/100g). Lutein (1.5-3.4 mg/100g), zeaxanthin (0.2-0.5 mg/100g), β-carotene (0.2-0.8 mg/100g). Year significantly impacts tocopherols & carotenoids. Finola highest γ-tocopherol & δ-tocopherol.

* **Phenolic Profile & Antioxidant Activity (Figure 2, Figure 4, Figure 5, Table 3):** TPC (381.8-779.8 mg GAE/100g).  Main phenolics: N-trans-caffeoyltyramine (14.8-83.2 mg/100g), cannabisin A (51.1-159.1 mg/100g), protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, cinnamic acid. ABTS (458.8-1066.3 mg TE/100g), FRAP (338.4-806.8 mg TE/100g). Year significantly impacts TPC and antioxidant activity; 2017 highest. Futura highest antioxidant activity.  Strong correlation between TPC, N-trans-caffeoyltyramine, cannabisin A, and antioxidant activity. Weak correlation between γ-tocopherol and antioxidant activity.

**Conclusions:** Genotype primarily affects nutritional components (oil, protein, fatty acid profile); Year primarily affects phytochemicals (total phenolics, tocopherols, carotenoids) and antioxidant activity. Finola shows promise for Greek cultivation due to high oil and protein content.  Findings inform cultivar selection & breeding programs for enhanced nutritional and antioxidant properties.
