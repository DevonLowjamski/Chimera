cannabis_cannabinoid_hplc_dad_analysis.txt

HPLC-DAD method for quantitative cannabis cannabinoid analysis in diverse commercial products.

**Cannabinoids Analyzed:** CBD, CBDA, Δ9-THC, THCA, CBN, Δ8-THC, CBG, CBGA, CBDV, THCV, CBC.  Method validated for CBD, Δ9-THC, CBDA, THCA, CBN.

**Extraction:** 95% ethanol (or 100% for aqueous matrices).  Modifications for high sugar/carb matrices (aqueous solvent first, heat, then 100% ethanol), and semisolid fats/oils (heat to melt).

**HPLC Parameters:** MacMod ACE 5 C18-AR column (5µm, 4.6 mm ID × 250 mm); Mobile phase: 66:34 acetonitrile:0.5% acetic acid; Injection volume: 25 µL; Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min; Run time: 50 min; Detection wavelengths: 220, 240, 270, 307 nm (compound-specific). LOQ: 10 mg/g.

**Sample Types:** Cannabis plants, extracts, oils, edibles, beverages, topicals, vapes/eliquids, oral supplements, capsules, tablets.

**Method Validation:** Precision (RSD) <20%; Accuracy (spike recovery): 80–120%.  Dronabinol capsule analysis confirmed accuracy.

**Precision/Accuracy Data:** Tables 2-6 detail results for various matrices.  Average %RSD across multiple cannabinoids and matrices (Tables 2,3,5): 2.5-6.1%. Average spike recovery across multiple matrices (Table 6): 94-101%.  Hempseed oil extraction of THCA <200 mg/g challenging.

**LOD/LOQ:** LOD (injected standard): 0.20 mg/mL; LOQ (injected standard): 0.50 mg/mL; LOQ (finished products): 10 mg/g (conservative).  Sensitivity sufficient for most commercial products but may require preconcentration for lower levels.
