cannabis_chemovar_classification_metabol_1.txt

**Abstract:** Metabolomics bridges patient (cultural) and scientist (chemical) cannabis terminology.  460 Dutch cannabis accessions (hemp & drug-type) analyzed via GC for 44 terpenes/cannabinoids; multivariate data analysis identified Indica/Sativa markers.  Chemovar mapping aids medicinal cannabis program decision-making.

**Introduction:** Cannabis research challenges the "single compound-single target" paradigm.  >700 cultivars exist, with complex, potentially therapeutic effects beyond THC.  Current classifications (drug/fiber, Sativa/Indica) insufficient for medicinal purposes.  Genetic analysis shows moderate correlation between strain ancestry and DNA. Vernacular classification (Sativa/Indica) lacks standardized labeling; unreliable for chemical composition prediction.  Chemovar (chemical variety) classification proposed.

**Goal:** Determine if chemical profiles replace vernacular names for cannabis classification. 460 Dutch accessions (coffeeshops, Bedrocan, HempFlax) analyzed by GC/FID for 44 compounds (17 monoterpenes, 19 sesquiterpenes, 8 cannabinoids; CBN, delta-8-THC, THC combined as "THC total").

**Materials & Methods:**  Standards: Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka, Chromadex, Roth (terpenes);  purified/quantified standards (CBD, THC, CBG, CBC, THCV, CBN) (cannabinoids). Extraction: 500mg sample + 40mL ethanol (repeated twice with 25mL); 200µL 1-octanol (IS); final volume 100mL ethanol.  GC: Agilent 6890 series, DB5 column, FID;  temperature gradient 60-240°C (3°C/min), 5min hold;  peak integration; IS correction; PCA & OPLS-DA analysis.  GC-MS for peak confirmation (NIST library). Quantification: calibration curves (beta-pinene, alpha-humulene, CBD standards);  results uncorrected for moisture.  Multivariate Data Analysis: PCA (unsupervised); OPLS-DA (supervised, Sativa/Indica). T-test for quantitative differences (Hemp, Sativa, Indica).

**Results & Discussion:** 460 accessions: Hemp (121), Sativa (68), Indica (63), Hybrid (208).  36 terpenes identified (Nerolidol possibly alpha-gurjunene); beta-phellandrene/R-limonene combined.  PCA: Hemp vs. drug-type separation (PC1: 28.3%, PC2: 8.5%).  CBD vs. THC major PC1 contributors. Sesquiterpenes (alpha-humulene, beta-caryophyllene, etc.) vs. monoterpenes (gamma-terpinene, alpha-phellandrene, etc.) separation along PC2. OPLS-DA (Sativa/Indica):  good model quality (R2X=0.387, Q2=0.582); trans-bergamotene, trans-beta-farnesene, delta-3-carene, terpinolene (Sativa); beta-/gamma-eudesmol, guaiol, myrcene, gamma-elemene (Indica).  Quantitative analysis: Hemp significantly lower cannabinoid content than Sativa/Indica (except CBD);  Sativa slightly higher CBC/CBG; hydroxylated terpenes higher in Indica (guaiol, beta-/gamma-eudesmol, alpha-bisabolol). Myrcene higher in Indica.  Chemovar mapping: Dutch medicinal cannabis program;  six standardized varieties + 31 experimental accessions. PCA map shows gaps (Amnesia-type identified by patients and analysis).  New variety (Amnesia-type) planned.

**Conclusion:**  GC-FID metabolomics effectively distinguishes cannabis types. Hemp: higher CBD; drug-type: diverse, higher cannabinoids/terpenes (except CBD); monoterpene vs. sesquiterpene subgroups. Sativa/Indica:  differences in terpene profiles (hydroxylated terpenes in Indica).  Chemovar mapping useful for medicinal cannabis programs.  Future research:  unified terpene analysis method; broader geographic sampling.
