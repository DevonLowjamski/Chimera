**Objective:** Assess cross-infectivity of powdery mildew (PM) between hemp (Cannabis sativa) and hop (Humulus lupulus).

**Hemp Production:** Increased dramatically since 2014 Farm Bill; >500,000 acres licensed in 2019.  Cannabaceae family member; host to Golovinomyces spadiceus (PM).

**Hop Production:**  >95% in Pacific Northwest (PNW); resurgence in Midwest/East;  host to Podosphaera macularis (PM). P. macularis introduced to PNW 1997; MAT1-1 mating type only; quarantine efforts to prevent MAT1-2 introduction.

**Isolates:** G. spadiceus (hemp isolates 19001, 19002 from NY greenhouses, cultivars ‘Lifter’, ‘17GH-F1’); P. macularis (hop isolates NY002, NY005 from feral H. japonicus in NY).  GenBank accessions:  G. spadiceus (MN365027, MN381107); P. macularis (MN381106, MN381108).  Hemp cultivars: ‘Anka’, ‘Wild Horse’, ‘TJ’s CBD’. Hop cultivars: ‘Symphony’, ‘Zeus’.

**Isolates Confirmed:**  28S and ITS sequencing, morphology consistent with G. spadiceus and P. macularis.

**Cross-Infectivity Assays:** G. spadiceus infects detached hop leaves (weakly), but not potted plants; P. macularis infects hemp cultivars ‘Anka’, ‘Wild Horse’ (compatible), but not ‘TJ’s CBD’ (non-host resistance).

**Mating Type Assays:** P. macularis isolates NY002 (MAT1-2), NY005 (MAT1-1); sexual reproduction on hemp observed. G. spadiceus mating type undetermined; no sexual reproduction observed between isolates.  No chasmothecia formed in G. spadiceus/P. macularis crosses.

**Implications:** P. macularis infection of hemp poses risk of introducing MAT1-2 into PNW, enhancing pathogenicity. Further research on P. macularis infection of diverse hemp cultivars and geographic hop isolates needed.
