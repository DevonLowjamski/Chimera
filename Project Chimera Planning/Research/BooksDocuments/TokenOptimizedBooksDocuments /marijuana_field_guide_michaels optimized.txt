Plant Growth Stages: Seedling (young, vulnerable), Vegetative (leaf/stem growth), Flowering (bud production). Each stage has unique, player-managed environmental/nutritional needs.

Cannabis Overview:  Marijuana = female cannabis plant flower. Produces phytocannabinoids activating endocannabinoid receptors (humans & animals).  THC (psychoactive, "high"), CBD (therapeutic).

Historical Data: First use ~7000 BC (China); 0 deaths from marijuana use; 75+ cannabinoids; average THC potency 14% (1% in 1970s); Marijuana Tax Stamp Act 1937; California Prop 215 (medical marijuana) 1996; Colorado recreational use 2014; 220m+ adult users worldwide; 420 = cannabis culture time/date.

Plant Anatomy: Flowers/buds (highest cannabinoid concentration, top bud = "cola"); Trichomes (resin glands); Pistils (hairs, no cannabinoids); Fan leaves (no significant THC); Sugar leaves (contain cannabinoids); Stems (little to no THC); Seeds (half male/female, seedless buds = sinsemilla); Stalks (hemp fiber).

Cannabis Strains: Three main categories: Sativa (daytime, uplifting, energetic); Indica (nighttime, body stoned, relaxing, sleepy); Hybrid (mix of sativa & indica, indica/sativa dominant, or true hybrid). Phenotype = observable characteristics (size, shape, color, THC content, etc.). Genotype = genetic makeup. Phenotype variations possible due to environment (growing location, soil, fertilizer, light, water). Indoor growing = more scientific, outdoor = more artisanal.

Entourage Effect: Cannabinoids work together. THC (primary psychoactive); CBD (non-psychoactive, reduces THC psychoactivity, muscle relaxation); CBN (mildly psychoactive, analgesic); CBC (non-psychoactive, potentiates THC); THCV (psychoactive, low doses increase THC, high doses oppose THC); CBG (precursor to other cannabinoids).  Typical potency percentages: THC 8-20%, CBD 1-4%, others <1%.

Terpenoids:  Cannabis essential oils; affect aroma, flavor, therapeutic effects.  Major terpenoids: Alpha-pinene (piney, anti-inflammatory), Linalool (floral, anti-anxiety), Myrcene (citrus, anti-inflammatory), Beta-caryophyllene (spicy, analgesic), Nerolidol (floral, antifungal), Caryophyllene Oxide (peppery, antifungal), Limonene (citrus, antidepressant), Phytol (earthy, anti-insomnia). Flavor categories: Sour, Spicy, Sweet, Bitter, Savory.

Landraces: Ancient, pure cannabis plants adapted to specific regions.  Examples: Durban Poison (South Africa, sativa), Afghani (Afghanistan, indica), Lamb’s Bread (Jamaica, sativa), Maui Waui (Hawaii, sativa), Panama Red (Panama, sativa). Important for breeding new strains.

Buyer's Guide: Quality grades: Low (poor bag appeal, dry, dull, harsh, <5% THC); Mid ("regs", average, 6-14% THC); High (great bag appeal, fluffy, vivid, smooth, 15-25%+ THC).  Consider pedigree, weight (avoid prepackaged), appearance (fluffy, vibrant, manicured, trichomes), feel (dense, squishy, sticky), smell (pleasant, avoid moldy/ammonia), personal experience (note strains, sources, effects, side effects: dry mouth, headache, paranoia, dizziness, dry eyes, confusion).

Cannabis Terms:  100+ terms listed (A-Z, quantity terms, money terms).  Negative terms: brick, bunk, dirt, ditch, schwag, sticks.

Storage: Airtight glass jar, cool (40-80°F), dark, dry place. Avoid handling, moisture, refrigeration, freezing. Shelf life: months (proper storage), weeks (improper storage).

Cannabis Products: Buds (smoked/vaporized); Kief (trichome crystals, raw powder, hashish); Concentrates (extracted cannabinoids/terpenes, 60-90% THC): Hash (ice water extraction), Bubble Hash (varying plant material proportion), BHO (butane hash oil), Shatter ("glass"), Wax, Budder, Honeycomb, Crumble, QWISO (isopropyl alcohol extraction); Edibles (heat required for activation): Tea, Canna-butter, Cooking oils, Tinctures, Salves. Decarboxylation: heat activates cannabinoids.

Smoking Options: Joint (marijuana cigarette), Spliff (tobacco + marijuana), Blunt (marijuana in cigar wrapper), Pipes (bowl, carb, stem, mouthpiece, chillum, one-hitter, bubbler), Bong (water pipe, chamber, bowl, slide, downstem, mouthpiece, base), Hookah (water pipe, multiple hoses), Vaporizers (heat herb below combustion).  How to Roll a Joint (steps detailed).

Smoking Etiquette: Puff and Pass, Keep the Rotation, Take the First Hit, Leave Green Hits, Keep It Dry, Cashed Out, Enough for Everyone, Join In, Lights Out, Good Hookups, Don’t Hit and Run, Return the Favor, Keep It Private, Respect Others.

Myths and Misconceptions: Cannabis is not a Schedule I drug (neuroprotective, easier to research other drugs than cannabis); does not kill brain cells or destroy memory (diminished working memory while intoxicated); not a gateway drug; not highly addictive (low addiction rates compared to other substances); has medical value (treats insomnia, anxiety, nausea, etc., FDA-approved for nausea/pain, Sativex approved in 40 countries).

NORML Principles of Responsible Use: Adults only, No driving while impaired, Consider set and setting, Resist abuse, Respect rights of others.
