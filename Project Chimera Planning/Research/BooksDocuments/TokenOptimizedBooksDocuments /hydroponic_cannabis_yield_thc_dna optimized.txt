**Study Objective:** Estimate indoor hydroponic Cannabis yield & value; replicate typical NZ Police seizures.  ScrOG method used.

**Methodology:** Three 6-plant cycles (Grow 1-3). Plants tested for THC%, genetically profiled (STR analysis).  Grow 1 plants sourced illegally; Grow 2 cloned from Grow 1; Grow 3 from police seizure. Grows 1 & 2 used ScrOG; Grow 3 did not.

**Growing Conditions:** 4.32m x 3.48m x 3.17m room. Inorganic medium, commercial nutrients.  Comparable to average NZ bedroom grow.

**Harvest & Drying:** Branches cut, hung to dry (70-75% weight loss). Groomed to leave female flowering heads.  Weights (g & oz) recorded. Mettler PE12 balance used.

**THC Analysis:** Six samples/plant. Adapted Poulsen & Sutherland method [23].  Agilent 6890 GCMS, HP-5ms column. Internal standard: 4-androstene-3,17-dione.

**STR DNA Analysis:** Grow 1 & 3 leaf samples. Five trinucleotide STR loci [24]. Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini Kit. ABI PRISM 3130 Genetic Analyzer. GenAlEx v6 PCA.

**Results:**

* **Yield:**
    * Grow 1: 5285g (186.43oz), 881g/plant avg (max 1340g/plant).
    * Grow 2: 4404g (155.34oz), 734g/plant avg. Nutrient burn reduced yield.
    * Grow 3: 2671g (94.22oz), 445g/plant avg. Spider mite infestation reduced yield.
    * Overall: 12360g (436oz), 687g/plant avg.
* **THC:** Significant intra & inter-plant variation.
    * Grow 1: 4.3–25.2% (max 30%). Sativa-like plants (20-25.2% avg); Indica-like plants (4.3-9.2% avg). Four indica-like plants exhibited monoecy.
    * Grow 2: Significantly lower THC than Grow 1 clones.
    * Grow 3: THC values not reported as reliably reflecting 'true' levels due to issues.
    * Hassan & Somerville (ongoing ESR study): 4.2–18.1% (avg 10.9%, n=43). Shows dramatic increase in potency since 1996 [23].
* **DNA:**
    * Grow 3: Identical genetic profiles (clones).
    * Grow 1: Genetic diversity.  Plant 6 unique triallelic pattern at ANUC302 & ANUC303 (possible polyploidy). Three genetic groups identified, correlating with phenotype and THC.


**Conclusion:** ScrOG method yields high average (687g/plant) and maximum (1340g) dry female flowering heads, but problems impacted yield & THC results. THC levels significantly higher than previously reported in NZ (up to 30%). DNA analysis supports phenotypic & THC variations, except for one plant. Further research needed on THC variance and subspecies THC production consistency.
