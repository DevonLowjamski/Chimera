**Objective:** Determine if Cannabis inflorescence lipid composition varies with cultivation setting (enclosed vs. open field).

**Methods:** 84 Cannabis inflorescences (62 open field, 22 enclosed) from DEA seizures analyzed.  Lipids extracted, n-alkanes quantified by GC-FID, and carbon isotope ratios (δ¹³C) of n-C29 determined by GC-C-IRMS.  Data analyzed using Welch t-tests and Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis tests (α = 0.05).

**Results:**

* **n-alkane distributions:** n-C17 to n-C33 detected; n-C29 most abundant (929 ± 680 μg g⁻¹).  Open field plants showed significantly greater n-C29 (1041 ± 743 μg g⁻¹) and total n-alkane (1695 ± 1214 μg g⁻¹) concentrations than enclosed plants (n-C29: 614 ± 290 μg g⁻¹, total: 976 ± 432 μg g⁻¹).  Open field plants had higher CPI (14.0 ± 2.0) and lower ACL (28.8 ± 0.2) than enclosed plants (CPI: 12.6 ± 1.3, ACL: 29.0 ± 0.1).
* **δ¹³C of n-C29:**  Range: −56.9‰ to −28.9‰; average: −37.3 ± 4.4‰. Enclosed plants had significantly lower δ¹³C values (−41.3 ± 8.2‰) than open field plants (−36.2 ± 1.5‰). One enclosed plant showed exceptionally high δ¹³C (−28.9‰), possibly due to mislabeling or use of geothermally-derived CO₂.
* **δ¹³C fractionation (εapp):** Range: −11.3‰ to −4.8‰; average: −8.0 ± 1.1‰. Enclosed plants showed less negative εapp (−7.3 ± 0.8‰) than open field plants (−8.2 ± 1.0‰).
* **Cultivation model:**  Using existing δ¹³CBulk model with adjusted εapp (−8.0‰), 90% accuracy achieved in growth environment identification (98% for open field, 60% for enclosed).

**Conclusion:** Inflorescence n-alkane distributions, concentrations, and δ¹³C values differentiate enclosed and open field Cannabis cultivation.  This lipid analysis offers a potential tool for verifying cultivation setting claims in regulated markets, pending further mechanistic investigation.  Additional data points beyond n-C29 are needed for model refinement.
