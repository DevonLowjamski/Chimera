**Study Objective:** Characterize hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) root systems under varying growing conditions.

**Field Trial:** Two-year field trial (2004, 2005) in Northern Italy.  Three plant densities (120, 240, 360 plants/m²), three replicates. 60 kg N/ha pre-sowing fertilization. Futura 75 genotype.  13 cm inter-row distance. Preceding crop: wheat. Soil plowed 35 cm, harrowed before sowing.

**Soil Sampling:** End of flowering (July).  Two samples per plot to 130 cm depth (7.4 cm diameter core, 10 cm subsamples). One replicate sampled to 200 cm. Post-harvest cubic sample (3375 cm³) for taproot analysis.

**Soil Texture (USDA):** 2004: Loam (42% sand, 37% silt, 21% clay). 2005: Silt-clay-loam (8% sand, 61% silt, 31% clay). Top 40 cm: 1.5% (2004), 1.7% (2005) organic matter; pH 7.1 (both years).

**Meteorological Data:** Cadriano agro-meteorological station. Rainfall: 282 mm (2004), 178 mm (2005). Water table monitored.

**Root Analysis:** 2% oxalic acid pretreatment. Hydraulic sieving/centrifugation.  0.5 mm mesh sieve. 4% methylene blue staining. Canon CanoScan 3000 ex scanner (300 DPI). Axio Vision 4.5 (Zeiss) image analysis (Fibrelength algorithm). 105°C drying for biomass. Elemental Combustion System CHNO-S Costech ECS 4010 for C/N content.

**Root Length Density (RLD, cm/cm³):** Highest in top 10 cm (~5 cm/cm³). Decreased to 130 cm, peak at 90-100 cm (perched water table).  Reached 200 cm (2004), 130 cm (2005).  Not significantly affected by plant density or year. 50% RLD in top 50 cm.

**Root Diameter (RD, μm):** Finest (190 μm) in topsoil; increased to 100 cm, constant at 300 μm thereafter. Only influenced by depth.

**Root Biomass (RB, t/ha):** 2004: 3.21 t/ha; 2005: 2.41 t/ha. 50% RB (excluding taproots) in top 50 cm. Taproot biomass: 1.38 t/ha (2004), 1.01 t/ha (2005). Aboveground:belowground biomass ratio: 5.46.  Not significantly affected by plant density.

**Root Biomass Distribution:**  Y = 1 - e^(-βd); β = 0.984 (R² = 0.94).

**C/N Ratio:** 88 (taproots), 31 (fine roots). Carbon content ~41% in both. Fine roots: 1.31% N; Taproots: 0.48% N.

**Discussion:** Aboveground biomass unaffected by plant density (plasticity). Root parameters unaffected by plant density, consistent with aboveground plasticity. RLD and RDM higher in topsoil (nutrient/oxygen availability). RLD increase near 100 cm linked to perched water table.  2005 root depth limited by silt layer at 130 cm. Hemp exhibits deeper root systems than other crops (maize, wheat, etc.). Deep roots advantageous in Mediterranean climates and for carbon sequestration. Finer roots in top soil (favorable conditions). RD increase with depth linked to soil compaction.

**Conclusions:** Hemp root parameters unaffected by plant density (plasticity).  High root biomass, particularly deep roots, supports sustainable agriculture.
