Study: Nitrogen impact on medical cannabis (Cannabis sativa L. ‘Annapurna’) cannabinoid & terpenoid profiles.

Methods: Five N treatments (30, 80, 160, 240, 320 mg L⁻¹); 18/6 h light/dark (vegetative), then 12/12 h (flowering, 56 days); controlled environment (26/24°C, 44/60% RH);  irrigation (500-750 ml/pot/day, 30% drainage);  complete randomized design (5 replicates).

Measurements:  Inflorescence & leaf cannabinoids (HPLC), terpenoids (GC-MSD), plant morphology (height, stem diameter, inflorescence length, nodes), biomass (dry weight), nutrient concentrations (N, N-NO3, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Na), physiological parameters (osmotic potential, RWC, membrane leakage, photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2, water use efficiency).

Results:

* **Visual Appearance:**  30-80 mg L⁻¹ N: pale yellow leaves, smaller leaves (8-8.5 cm), smaller inflorescences.  160-320 mg L⁻¹ N: dark green, larger leaves (10.7-11.2 cm), larger inflorescences.

* **Biomass:** Inflorescence & inflorescence leaf biomass increased with N up to 160 mg L⁻¹ N;  leaf biomass increased steadily to 320 mg L⁻¹ N; root and stem biomass increased to 80 mg L⁻¹ N; NUE decreased with increasing N.

* **Cannabinoids:** Acidic cannabinoids (THCA, CBDA, THCVA, CBGA, CBCA) decreased with increasing N; non-acidic cannabinoids (THC, CBD, CBN) showed a bell-shaped curve, peaking at 160 mg L⁻¹ N;  inflorescence leaves showed no significant changes; inflorescence concentrations higher than leaves, no significant difference between top and side inflorescences; THCA and CBDA decreased by 69% and 63%, respectively, from 30 to 320 mg L⁻¹ N.  In-plant decarboxylation of THCA and CBDA increased with N.

* **Terpenoids:** Monoterpenes (α-pinene, β-pinene) lower at 30 mg L⁻¹ N; Myrcene, ipsdienol unchanged; most monoterpenes decreased with increasing N; Sesquiterpenes: (E)-α-bergamotene, 5-epi-7-epi-α-eudesmol, β-selinene higher at 30 mg L⁻¹ N; α-bulnesene, α-guaiene decreased with increasing N; most sesquiterpenes lower at 320 mg L⁻¹ N.

* **Nutrient Concentrations:** N and N-NO3 increased with N supply; K accumulation organ-specific; P lower at 320 mg L⁻¹ N, higher at 30-80 mg L⁻¹ N in leaves and stems; Ca and Mg highest at 160-240 mg L⁻¹ N in leaves; micronutrient response organ-specific and moderate.

* **Physiological Parameters:** Photosynthesis peaked at 160-240 mg L⁻¹ N; transpiration and stomatal conductance lower at 320 mg L⁻¹ N; intercellular CO2 decreased with increasing N; RWC unchanged; osmotic potential increased with N; WUEi increased to 240 mg L⁻¹ N; membrane leakage highest at 30 mg L⁻¹ N; photosynthetic pigments increased with N.


Conclusion:  160 mg L⁻¹ N optimal for maximum inflorescence yield and relatively high secondary metabolite content.  Higher N increases yield but decreases secondary metabolites.
