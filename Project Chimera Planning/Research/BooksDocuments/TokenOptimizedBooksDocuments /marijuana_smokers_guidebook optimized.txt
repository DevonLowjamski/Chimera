Identifying Quality Marijuana:

* Avoid crushed buds in plastic bags; use glass jars.
* Stellar weed is gorgeous, sparkly, dense, firm, easy to grind, and has a noticeable stink.
* Reputable sellers weigh bud on a scale and are proud of their product.
* Avoid pre-packaged bud.
* Check for mold (white stringy substance or black spots).
* Beware of sprayed bud (unnatural taste).
* Distinguishing Indica vs. Sativa: indicas are generally denser, smell less, and have a sedate stone; sativas are leaner, smell stronger, and have an uplifting high.  Hybrids blur these characteristics.

Moderating Cannabis Consumption:

* Take deep breaths; drink juice; be comfortable; consider your setting.
* Inhale slowly; wait for effects.
* Have munchies available.
* Don’t intentionally get new tokers overly high.


Identifying Grow Methods:

* Indoor trichomes are fatter and plumper than outdoor trichomes.
* Organic marijuana leaves a nice white ash.

Determining Potency:

* Sticky resin; glittering trichomes; cannabis crystals; stinky.  Potency is best determined by smoking it.


Advice for Medical Marijuana Patients:

* Access to a variety of strains is crucial.
* Experiment to find what works best for you.
* Recognize strains and growers that produce your preferred cannabis.
