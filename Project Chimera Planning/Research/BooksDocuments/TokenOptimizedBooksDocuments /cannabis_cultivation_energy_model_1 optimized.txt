Abstract:  Deterministic energy consumption model for indoor cannabis cultivation, focusing on lighting & HVAC (24-hour period).  Model validated using real-world facility measurements and GridLab-D.  Enables short/long-term energy demand & cost estimations.

Cannabis Cultivation Energy Consumption:  Significant energy consumer;  Denver (2014: 1.2% increase, 45% from cannabis; 2018: 4%); California (2017: 3% of state, 1% of US electricity). Indoor/greenhouse cultivation dominant (60%/37% in US, 2017). Indoor energy costs: 20-50% of total operating costs (≈150 kWh/yr/sq.ft).

Cultivation Stages: Seedling (propagation; <5% electricity, 5-40 W/sq.ft, 18-24 hrs, T5HO fluorescents, 24-26°C, 70-75% RH); Vegetative (30-40% electricity, 15-70 W/sq.ft, 18 hrs, HPS/MH/LED/CMH, 24-26°C, 65-70% RH); Flowering (50-65% electricity, 40-70 W/sq.ft, 12 hrs, 1000 W HPS, 24-26°C, 60-65% RH).  Flowering stage highest energy consumption.

Energy Consumption Model:  Considers lighting, ventilation, HVAC (temperature & humidity).

Assumptions: Well-sealed, insulated grow rooms; constant temperature/humidity per interval (1-5 min); appropriately sized HVAC; continuous HVAC/dehumidifier variables.

Model Description:

Lighting:  Power consumed (PLt,r,s, PLt,s, PLt) & total energy (EL) calculated based on lighting schedule (TL,onr,s, TL,offr,s) and fixture power (nLi, PLi).

Air Circulation: Power consumed (PCt,r,s, PCt,s, PCt) & total energy (EC) based on number of fans (nfan) & fan power (Pfan).

Humidity Control: Mass balance equation; factors include evapotranspiration (M˙trans,t,r,s = Ftrans,s * nplants,r,s * FLt,r,s, Ftrans: 0.25, 0.38, 0.5 kg/plant/hr for seedling, vegetative, flowering; FLt,r,s = 1 (lights on), 0.3 (lights off)), ventilation (M˙vent,t,r,s), infiltration (M˙inf,t,r,s), dehumidification (M˙D,t,r,s). Humidity ratio (ω) calculations using RH, temperature, partial pressure (Pv), saturation vapour pressure (Psat), air density (ρ). Dehumidifier power (PDt,r,s, PDt,s, PDt) & total energy (ED) based on operation state (αD), number of units (nD), airflow (V˙D), rated power (PD,rated).

Temperature Control: Energy balance equation.  Factors include HVAC (Qhvac,t,r,s), lighting (QLt,r,s = PLt,r,s * FSA * dt, FSA: 0.87-1.15 (T5HO), 1.1 (MH/HPS), 0.79 (LED)), evapotranspiration (Qtrans,t,r,s), conduction/convection (QCt,r,s), ventilation (Qvent,t,r,s), infiltration (Qinf,t,r,s). Temperature (K) calculations. HVAC power (Phvac,t,r,s, Phvac,t,s, Phvac,t) & total energy (Ehvac) based on heating/cooling mode (γH).

Simulation Results:

Real-World Facility: 4000 sq.ft flowering space, 1-min time steps, parameters in Table 1.  Hallway conditions: 25°C, 60% RH.  Ontario 2019 Summer TOU rates used.  Staggered lighting schedule. Peak demand: 237.1 kW.  Electricity intensity: 1.24 kWh/sq.ft/day.

Model Validation:  Compared with real-world facility measurements and GridLab-D simulations (Figure 9).  Lighting load average error: -0.6%; HVAC load average error: +1.2%.

Model Limitations: HVAC equipment diversity; assumed 80% HVAC efficiency; constant transpiration rates;  no lag times in heating/cooling; maximum plant capacity used.

Conclusion: Model accurately estimates energy consumption in indoor cannabis facilities, highlighting lighting as the major energy consumer and flowering as the most energy-intensive stage. Model validated against real-world data and GridLab-D.
