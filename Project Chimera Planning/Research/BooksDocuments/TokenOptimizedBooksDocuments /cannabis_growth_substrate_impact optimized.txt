Study: Indoor pot cultivation of two phytocannabinoid-rich Cannabis sativa genotypes (Kanada (KAN), 0.2x) using three substrates: peat-mix (PM), PM+30% green fibre (G30), coco coir fibre (CC).  Latin square design, 6 replicates per treatment.

**Substrates:** (Table 1 details composition; pot sizes 9cm (1-35 DAP), 12cm (36-70 DAP), 15cm (71-154 DAP))

**Methodology:** Vegetative propagation from cuttings.  Rooting hormone (0.25% 4-(3-indolyl)-butyric acid) used.  Plants transplanted at 35 DAP and 70 DAP.  18h photoperiod (vegetative), supplemented with Gavita HPS lamps (750W).  Fertilization: Plantactiv 18-12-18 (2g/L 3-19 DAP, 3g/L 20-61 DAP), Plantaactive 10-20-30 (2g/L 62-154 DAP).  Vegetative temp: 18.8-30.5°C; humidity: 24.6-68.8%.  Floral development initiated at 83 DAP (12h photoperiod); temp: 22.9-26.5°C; humidity: 40.8-75.4%.  Harvest at 154 DAP.  Measurements: plant height (weekly), SPAD values (weekly), DW (flowers, leaves, roots), N content (leaves, flowers), RLD. Cannabinoid extraction & HPLC analysis (Burgel et al. [28], Lehmann & Brenneisen [29] modified). Statistical analysis: mixed models (Equation 2, 3).

**Results:**

* **Plant Height (cm):** PM (39.96 ± 1.81), G30 (35.28 ± 1.52), CC (31.54 ± 1.61). PM & G30 significantly taller than CC. (Figure 1, Table 2).
* **SPAD:** KAN (PM 55.30, G30 56.10, CC 43.47); 0.2x (G30 52.77, PM 49.17, CC 41.83).  PM & G30 higher than CC. (Figure 2).
* **Leaf N content (g kg DW⁻¹):** G30 (52.24), PM (46.75), CC (37.00). G30 significantly higher than CC. (Figure 3). Flower N content: no significant difference. (Figure 3).
* **Flower DW (g plant⁻¹):** KAN (PM 8.56, G30 4.94, CC 3.84); 0.2x (PM 8.68, G30 9.19, CC 7.90). KAN significantly lower in G30 & CC than PM. (Table 3, Figure 4).
* **Leaf DW (g plant⁻¹):** PM (5.78), G30 (5.66), CC (3.30). PM & G30 significantly higher than CC. (Table 4).
* **RLD (cm cm⁻³):** G30 (3087.51), PM (2881.65), CC (2063.09). G30 significantly higher than CC. 0.2x significantly higher than KAN. (Table 4, Figure 5).
* **Root DW (g plant⁻¹):** 0.2x (1.52) > KAN (0.55). No significant substrate effect. (Table 5).
* **CBD/A (%m/m):** No significant difference between substrates. Genotype differences in yield (mg plant⁻¹): Flower: 0.2x (549.66) > KAN (335.28); Leaf: 0.2x (224.16) > KAN (135.91) (Table 5, Figure 6).


**Discussion:** G30 comparable to PM in plant height, SPAD, leaf N, RLD. CC lower in most parameters. Genotype-specific responses to substrates. 0.2x better overall yield. No significant substrate impact on CBD/A content.

**Conclusions:** G30 viable partial peat replacement.  Genotype selection crucial for yield optimization.  Further research on coco coir mixtures recommended.
