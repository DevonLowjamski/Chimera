**Nomenclature:** Botanical: *Cannabis* L. (includes *C. sativa*, *C. indica*); Family: Cannabaceae; Pharmacopoeial: *Cannabis Inflorescentia*; Common names: Cannabis, ganja, grass, hemp, marijuana, pot, weed, sinsemilla.  Taxonomic debate exists regarding species classification, often based on THC/CBD ratios.  Small & Cronquist (1976) proposed subspecies *sativa* (low THC, fiber/seed) and *indica* (high THC, intoxicant) within *C. sativa*. Hillig (2005) recognized sativa (hemp), indica (drug), and ruderalis gene pools.  Vernacular “sativa/indica” is botanically imprecise due to interbreeding.

**Identification:** Dioecious (rarely monoecious) annual herb.  Height 0.2-6m. Taproot (not developed in clones). Stem: furrowed, round/hexagonal, hollow. Leaves: alternate/opposite basally, palmately compound, (3)5–11(13) leaflets, lanceolate/linear. Leaflets: (3)7–15 x (0.2)0.5–1.5(2)cm, serrate margin, acuminate apex. Trichomes: glandular (sessile, bulbous, multicellular stalked), non-glandular (unicellular, cystolithic).  Most plants are short-day length, flowering with <14h light.  Global distribution.

**Macroscopic Identification:** Inflorescences (buds): 1.5–15cm branches, light/dark green, purple, brown.  Stems: light brown, pale green, purple, fibrous, furrowed. Upper leaves: often removed. Bracts: green/brownish-green, shrivel upon drying. Bracteoles: green/brownish-green, enclose flower/fruit. Flowers: unisexual, female flowers with styles/stigmas (reddish-brown at maturity). Fruit (achenes): 2–5mm, enclosed in bracteoles.

**Microscopic Identification:** Leaves/bracts: dorsiventral structure, palisade/spongy mesophyll, calcium oxalate crystals. Upper epidermis: cystolithic trichomes. Lower epidermis: non-cystolithic, glandular trichomes. Bracteoles: undifferentiated mesophyll, calcium oxalate crystals, glandular trichomes. Flowers: stigmatic papillae. Stem: few trichomes, laticiferous tubes.

**Organoleptic Characterization:** Aroma: varied (peculiar, narcotic, sweet, fruity, pungent, etc.). Color: light/dark green, purple, yellow-gold, brown (influenced by variety, cultivation, handling). Taste: bitter, acrid, resinous, pungent.

**Commercial Sources and Handling:** Sources: Federally legal (University of Mississippi), state-regulated, illegal. THC potency increased significantly since 1970s (1% to 29%).  EU potency lower, legal limit 0.2% THC (Canada: 0.3%). Fiber strains <1% THC. CBD-predominant strains developing.

**Sourcing:** US sources: Federally legal (University of Mississippi, NIDA), state-regulated (medical/recreational), illegal.  Transfer of federally legal cannabis requires DEA registration.  State regulations vary widely.

**Cultivation:** Seed/clone selection: Indica/sativa hybrids common. Soil: loamy/sandy, pH 6.5–7.2 (hydroponics 5.8–6.0). Fertilization: minimal leaching. Irrigation: controlled, contaminant-free water. Sexing: 8 weeks (outdoor). Male plants culled (except breeding). Outdoor: March-April planting, 6–8 months maturity (autoflowering strains 75 days).  Advantages: pest-resistance, natural environment, lower energy use. Disadvantages: uncontrollable conditions, mold risk. Indoor: Advantages: controlled conditions. Disadvantages: pest infestations (spider mites), energy consumption. Parameters: light (PPFD 1500 μmol/m2/s), humidity (75% juvenile, 55–60% vegetative/flowering), temperature (25–30°C tropical, 25°C temperate), CO2 (doubled ambient).  Propagation: seed, vegetative cuttings (soil, hydroponics, micropropagation). Genetic integrity maintained (except somaclonal variation). Pests/diseases: outdoor (birds, rabbits, fungi), indoor (spider mites, thrips, aphids, whiteflies).

**Harvest:** Timing: chemical analysis (HPLC/GC), visual (75–95% senesced stigmas/styles), trichome color.  Methods: individual buds/branches, whole plant. Steps: clipping from plant, bud from stem, large leaves, small leaves. Post-harvest: protect from pests, contaminants. Manicuring: hand/machine trimming, kief collection, trim separation.

**Drying:** Methods: hanging, commercial tobacco drying barn (40°C, 12–15h). Initial drying: 3 days, 15–21°C, 35% humidity. Final drying: plastic bags/glass containers, 1–2 weeks. Moisture content: 8–13% (UNODC), 5–10% (Netherlands). Over-drying: brittle outside, moist inside, mold risk. Decarboxylation: occurs during drying/storage, expedited by heat.

**Packaging:** Netherlands: European Pharmacopoeia Chapter 5.1.4, gamma irradiation (<10kGy).  Microbial reduction critical.

**Storage:** Degradation negligible if protected from air/light. UM storage: FDA-approved polyethylene bags, fiber drums (18–20°C short-term, -20°C long-term). Freezing can damage trichomes. THC degradation to CBN.

**Natural Contaminants and Adulterants:** Natural: other plant species, degradation products, microbes, heavy metals. Adulterants: growth enhancers, pesticides, glass beads, psychotropic substances, lead (Germany), sildenafil analogs (Netherlands). Synthetic cannabinoids (“Spice,” “K2”).

**Qualitative Differentiation:** Free from foreign matter, molds, bacteria, excess stems/seeds, heavy metals, pesticides.  THC/CBD ratios vary depending on medical needs and desired organoleptic qualities.

**Sustainability and Environmental Impact:** Outdoor cultivation: water diversion, deforestation, chemical dumping. Indoor cultivation: high energy consumption. GAPs recommended. Butane extraction risks (explosions, fires).

**Documentation of Supply:**  Location, previous crops, starting materials, chemicals used, cultivation conditions, harvest details, yield, pest control measures.

**Constituents:** >750 compounds. Cannabinoids (THC, CBD, CBG, CBN, THCV, CBC, etc.), terpenoids, flavonoids, other compounds.  Cannabinoid acids (THCA, CBDA, CBGA) non-psychoactive.  THC: partial agonist at CB1/CB2 receptors. CBD: non-psychoactive, acts on 5-HT1A, TRPV1 receptors. CBG: non-psychoactive, weak CB1/CB2 ligand, GABA uptake inhibitor.  CBN: degradation product of THC. Terpenoids: aroma, modulate THC effects. Flavonoids: phytoestrogens, cannflavins (COX inhibitors). Other compounds: carbohydrates, amino acids, phenols, alcohols, etc.

**Analytical:** THC quantitation historically primary focus. Now, other cannabinoids (CBD, THCV), terpenoids. Methods: GC (in situ decarboxylation, total THC), HPLC (quantifies both acidic and neutral forms), TLC (identification).  Sampling protocol critical for accurate representation.

**Thin-Layer Chromatography:** Sample preparation: extraction (dichloromethane), decarboxylation (optional).  Reagents: Fast Blue, vanillin/H2SO4.  Mobile phase: 75:25 methanol/water (0.1% acetic acid).  Visualization: UV 254 nm, Fast Blue, vanillin/H2SO4.  Identifies primary cannabinoids, distinguishes THC-dominant, CBD-dominant, and fiber types.

**High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC):** Sample preparation: extraction (methanol/chloroform). Internal standard: diazepam (or methyl/propylparaben).  Column: Waters X-Bridge C18.  Mobile phase: ammonium formate/acetonitrile.  Detection: diode array (228nm for neutrals, 270nm for acids). Quantifies THCA-A, Δ9-THC, CBDA, CBD, CBGA, CBG, CBN.

**Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID):** Sample preparation: extraction (internal standard: 4-androstene-3,17-dione). Column: DB-1MS. In situ decarboxylation quantifies total cannabinoids.

**Limit Tests:** Foreign organic matter, total ash, acid-insoluble ash, loss on drying, moisture content. Microbial/fungal limits (Table 9). Metal limits (Table 11). Pesticide limits (Table 10). Solvent residues (Table 12, Table 13).

**International Status:** Regulations vary widely.  US: Schedule I controlled substance (federal), state laws vary (medical/recreational). Canada: MMPR (licensed producers, medical access). EU: varying regulations, citizens' initiative for legalization. India: ganja/charas illegal, bhang regulated. Israel: regulated medical access. Netherlands: OMC supplies medicinal cannabis. Switzerland: Sativex® approved. Uruguay: legalized cultivation, sale, consumption.  Severe penalties in some countries (Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, UAE).
