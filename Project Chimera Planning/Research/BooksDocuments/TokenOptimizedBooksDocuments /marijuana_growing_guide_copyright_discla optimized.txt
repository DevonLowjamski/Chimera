**Growing Marijuana:** Requires light (proper spectrum, intensity, duration), water (abundant, not excessive), air (ideal temperature, flow, CO2-rich), nutrients (right amounts), growing medium (right texture, ingredients), optimal environmental conditions (heat, humidity). Indoor growing offers environmental control (humidity, temperature, nutrients, lighting), safety, but smaller crops & requires artificial lighting; outdoor growing uses sunlight, natural ventilation, but lacks control, privacy, & risks pollination by wild pollen.  Indoors: 10 plants, 400W light ≈ 5-10 oz; Outdoors: 1 plant ≈ 1 lb+. Soil easier for beginners; hydroponics faster, larger yields but requires more monitoring and is less forgiving.  Soil often preferred for taste & forgiveness. Hydroponics offers faster growth & higher yields due to readily available nutrients & no transplant shock. Leaching removes excess salts from hydroponic buds before harvest; time varies (2 days – 2 weeks).

**Marijuana:** Cannabis Sativa (cannabis); leaves, flowers (dried, crushed for smoking; added to food/beverages); potency varies. Cannabinoids (psychoactive chemicals); THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) most important; concentrated in female plant resin (hashish ≈ 8x stronger than typical US marijuana). Historical medicinal uses (analgesic, anesthetic, antidepressant, antibiotic, sedative). Effects depend on strength, frequency of use, recency of use, and individual body reaction.

**Positive Effects:** Mood lift, relaxation, stress reduction, creative thinking, increased music appreciation, increased sensory awareness, reduced muscle fatigue, pain relief, reduced nausea.

**Neutral Effects:** Increased appetite, altered consciousness, sleepiness, bloodshot eyes, dry mouth, temporary memory interruption, difficulty following trains of thought.

**Negative Effects:** Nausea, coughing, asthma aggravation, short-term memory problems (heavy, frequent use), slowed reactions, racing heart, agitation, anxiety, panic attacks (high doses/sensitive users), headaches, dizziness, confusion, vomiting, potential psychological dependence, mild withdrawal symptoms (daily use).


**Using Marijuana:** Smoking/inhaling (fastest route; shallow puffs preferred; vaporization safer, more economical); pipes/bongs (glass/stainless steel/brass preferred); joints (loose, fat joints preferred; avoid tobacco); water pipes (least efficient, harmful); vaporization (heats, doesn't burn; gentler on lungs; more economical); eating/drinking (effective, economical; overdose possible; avoid adulterated/infected products); tinctures (oral drops; creams/lotions); creams/lotions (topical pain relief).


**What Gets You High:** Cannabinoids (THC, CBN, THCV, CBC); THC main psychoactive ingredient; levels genetically determined; quantities (bud mass, resin production) controllable by grower.  CBD (cannabidiol) not psychoactive; interacts with THC (potentiates depressant effects, antagonizes euphoric effects; delays onset, prolongs duration).  High THC/low CBD: energetic high; low THC/high CBD: sedative, lethargic; high THC/high CBD: dreamlike high.  Sativa: high THC/low CBD; Indica: high CBD/low THC.

**Strains:** Indica (squat, dense; long internodes; broad, pointy leaves; pungent odor; thick smoke; body stone; higher yield; faster maturation; easier to grow; higher CBD, lower THC); Sativa (tall, hardy; short internodes; narrow, finger-like leaves; sweet, fruity aroma; smooth smoke; cerebral, energetic high; longer maturation; larger height; lower yield; less chlorophyll; more accessory pigments; higher THC, lower CBD); Hybrids (combination of Indica and Sativa characteristics).

**Choosing Your Variety:** Consider high type, maturation time, plant shape, genetics (potency, aroma, growth rate, pest/fungus resistance, yield). For beginners: Big Bud, Top 44, Northern Lights, Skunk #1.  Yield depends on growing conditions & genetics; potency also depends on growing conditions; flowering times determined by Indica/Sativa ratio & growing conditions.

**Seeds:** Sexual propagation; contain genes of both parents; hermaphrodites (both male & female flowers). Selecting viable seeds: plump, oily, hard, dark brown/beige; avoid cracked, green, shiny, or excessively dark seeds. Store in cool, dark place (refrigeration recommended; ideal: 41°F/5°C); desiccants (rice, silica crystals) absorb moisture. Seed moisture & temperature affect viability.


**World's Greatest Seedbanks:** Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds, Buy Dutch Seeds, The Attitude Seedbank, Nirvana Shop, Sensi Seedbank, Hemp Depot, Skunk Seeds.

**Cannabis:** Top cola, mid-section, base. Flowers (highest cannabinoid concentration); leaves (less potent; extraction possible); grow tips (more potent than shade leaves); trim leaves (potent); stems (fiber); seeds (nutritious; trace cannabinoids); trichomes (highest cannabinoid concentration; hash made from pressed trichomes); roots (nutrient uptake).

**Sexing:** Male (staminate flowers – "balls on a stick"; remove to prevent pollination); Female (pistillate flowers – pear-shaped calyxes with pistils); Hermaphrodite (both male & female flowers; undesirable; releases pollen; offspring inherit hermaphrodite tendency). Methods: pre-flowers (appear 4th week of vegetative growth; need magnification); forcing flowering (12/12 light cycle); paper bag method.


**Stages of Growth:** Germination (moisture, heat, air activate hormones; root emerges, seed leaves appear); Seedling (root system, stem, leaves develop; 16-18 hours light); Vegetative (rapid growth; ½-2 inches/day; photosynthesis begins; grow tips develop); Pre-Flowering (plant stops growing in height; sex becomes apparent; pre-flowers at nodes; lasts 1-2 weeks); Flowering (bud production; pollination affects bud development).
