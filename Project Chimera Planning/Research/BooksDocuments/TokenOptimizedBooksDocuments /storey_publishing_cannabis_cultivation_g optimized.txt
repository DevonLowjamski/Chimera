Preface: Authors met in middle school; UCSC environmental studies; started New Family Farm (2010); transitioned to cannabis cultivation (2015); founded Atlas Seed (breeding for agricultural applications).  Book aims to codify knowledge, lower production costs. Assumes basic-intermediate knowledge of cannabis botany and farming. Focuses on outdoor row-crop cultivation for flower (THC/CBD). Excludes industrial hemp, indoor cultivation, light-deprivation greenhouses, extraction technologies.

Introduction: Farming is risky; cannabis cultivation adds further risks (stigma, theft, bureaucracy, pollination, genetics, weather, business practices, start-up costs).  Cannabis cultivation lags behind other crops due to its illegal status.

Agronomic Mindset: Cannabis is a crop; efficient farming balances labor efficiency and thoroughness (“touches”).  Cannabis genome adds variation; methods differ for photoperiod/autoflower/clones/seeds.

Section 1: Planning.  Genetics: Terpenes (smell/taste; Appendix II details aroma families); Potency (THC/CBD percentage; varies within plant/population; influenced by temperature; potassium/calcium); Selecting Genetics (market dynamics, climate, local growers, breeders); Light Cycle/Flower Maturation (days to maturity, initiation, flowering time, finish time;  full-term (sativa/indica), semi-full-term (auto/photo cross), autoflower (ruderalis × sativa/indica)); Seasonal/Environmental Considerations (frost, rain, humidity, wind, latitude); Clones (benefits: maturity, terpene profile, cannabinoid content, canopy height, genetic preservation; drawbacks: cost, pests [HLVd], vigor, resilience); Feminized Seed (advantages: cost-effectiveness, vigor, resilience; drawbacks: occasional males).

Plant Nutrition: Living Soil Approach (cover crops, amendments [physical/chemical, organic matter, fertilizers]); Using Cover Crops (winter: rye, oat, vetch, peas, beans, clover, turnips, radishes, rapeseed, triticale; summer: Sudan grass, cowpeas, buckwheat, millet, hemp); Choosing Amendments (soil tests, lime, gypsum, compost, manure, fertilizers [N-P-K, micronutrients]); Putting It All Together (visual cues, tissue analysis).

Managing Insects/Fungi: Healthy Ecosystem (beneficial flowers, hedgerows, soil); Plant-Positive Approach (minimize stress); Pest Mitigation (close looking, aphids, mites, caterpillars, nematodes, fungus gnats, cucumber beetles, thrips, root aphids, bud rot [botrytis]).

Section 2: Planting.  Tillage/Field Prep (flail-mow, compost, spade, fertilizer, beds/plastic mulch); Effective Tillage Techniques (flail mower, mechanical spader, drag disc, two-bottom plow, deep ripper); Leveling the Field; Shaping Beds (rototiller shaper, pan shaper, cultimulcher, tractor tires, homemade); Plastic Mulch Considerations (water usage, weed suppression, root zone warming, yield; difficulties: soil prep, loosening, soil visibility, cleanup).

Propagation: Starting Autoflower Seeds (floating medium: peat plugs, Growcoons, Ellepots, tray size, damping-off); Starting Full-Term/Semi-Full-Term Seeds (no floating medium, tray size, up-potting); Seeding (vacuum seeder, hand seeding, planting depth, watering, emergence); Ideal Germination Temperature (75–80°F, 70% RH); Light Requirements; Soil Fertility; Days to Transplant; Hardening Off; Commercial Nurseries.

Section 3: Crop Management. Watering/Weeding (needs, overhead irrigation, drip tape, cultivation); Determining Watering Needs (visual cues, ball test, moisture probes, forecasts); Watering During Vegetative Growth; Overhead Irrigation; Drip Tape Irrigation (tape thickness, emitter spacing, pressure-compensating); Cultivating to Kill Weeds (hand: hand hoe, hula hoe, wheel hoe; mechanical: three-point hitch, finger weeder).

Canopy Management (topping, trellising [corralling, netting], pruning, de-leafing); Topping (knee-shoulder high, 4–12 inches); Trellising (T-posts, wire/rope, netting); Pruning (“shaving the legs”); De-leafing (timing, effects, labor).

Pollen Management (self-pollination [stress, breeding], male pollination [roguing], pollen drift [ethephon], breeding sterile plants).

Spray Program: Sprayer Types (backpack, boom, venturi air-blast); Spray Products (Marrone Bio Innovations, Bt, horticultural oils, sulfur); Spray Timing (labels, sunlight, heat); Foliar Feeding.

Section 4: Harvest/Processing. Harvest (harvest window [preemies, ideal, overmaturation], flower appearance [pistils, trichomes], potency, de-leafing, other variables [weather, mold, labor, harvests, dry/cure], preparation, extraction, fresh frozen, smokable flower [whole plant, stems, partial buck, wet buck]); Getting the Crop In; Estimating Harvest Costs.

Post-Harvest (ideal dry space, drying cycle [initial sweat, equalization], dryness assessment [water activity meter], overdrying, curing, storage [temperature, humidity, burping], remote monitoring).

Processing: Bucking Dry Material, Trimming (trim machines, labor), Grading (smalls, mids, tops), Packaging and Final Storage.

Epilogue: Future of Cannabis Products (extraction, smokable flower), Evolving Cultivation Systems and Mechanization (stripper header), Future of Genetics (field-ready traits, ploidy breeding, F1 hybrids), A Plant Unlike Any Other.

Appendix I: Effect of Regulation on Cultivation Culture (prohibition, medical cannabis, greenhouses, modern regulations [canopy tax, setbacks, acreage limits, track and trace]).

Appendix II: Cannabis Aroma Families (OG/Chem/Kush, Cream/Cake/Cookies/Candy, Jack/Haze, Tropical/Floral, Exotics).
