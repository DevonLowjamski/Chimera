**Study Objective:** Quantify US indoor cannabis cultivation's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology (cradle-to-gate).

**Industry Context:** US legal cannabis sales: $3.5B (2012) to $13.6B (annual).  Colorado: >530 tonnes/year. 48% of US adults have tried cannabis; 13% in past year.  41% of North American producers cultivate solely indoors due to quality control and security. Indoor cultivation requires significant energy. Prior GHG estimations were rudimentary, omitting sources beyond electricity bills. Mills (2012) estimated 4600 kg CO2e/kg dried flower, based on small-scale data pre-legalization.

**Methodology:** Developed model tracks energy/materials for year-round indoor cultivation across 1011 US locations (independent of legal status). Model uses hourly weather data (NREL) and electricity grid emissions data (EPA eGRID, 26 regions).  Includes GHG emissions from: electricity, natural gas (indoor climate control, high-intensity grow lights), upstream (water, fertilizers, fungicides, CO2), and downstream (landfill waste). Air exchange rate (ACH): 30 (literature range 12-60 ACH).  Plant growth stages: clone (22 days), vegetative (50 days), flower (57 days), cure (14 days); 6.2 harvests/year assumed.

**Results:** Life cycle GHG emissions: 2283-5184 kg CO2e/kg dried flower (Long Beach, CA - Kaneohe Bay, HI; median 3658 kg CO2e/kg).  Major contributors: HVAC (heating, cooling, humidity management; largest contributor regardless of location), high-intensity grow lights, supplemental CO2 (production, not gas itself).  Traditional agricultural GHG sources (<5% total).  >80% of emissions from non-traditional practices.

**Geographic Variation (Fig. 1, 2):** Mountain West & Midwest show high intensity.  Fig. 2 details GHG contributions for ten diverse locations, showing HVAC as the dominant source, followed by lighting.  Supplemental equipment (<2% total GHG emissions). Dehumidifiers not used at 30 ACH.

**Sensitivity Analysis (Fig. 3):** Plant yield most sensitive variable.  ACH (10-60): GHG emissions difference >230%. Non-linear relationship between ACH and GHG emissions due to supplemental equipment use.  Temperature, humidity ranges, and CO2 concentrations also highly sensitive, linked to ACH.

**Policy Implications:**  Results inform best management practices (BMPs), reducing GHGs from HVAC, lighting, CO2.  Geographic optimization possible within states (e.g., Colorado: Leadville vs. Pueblo).  Outdoor/greenhouse cultivation could significantly reduce emissions (preliminary estimates: 42-96% reduction).  Colorado example: potential 1.3% reduction in state's annual GHG emissions.

**Model Validation:** Compared model energy requirements to standard office and lab building data (Energy Star).  Energy intensities compared to literature values for lighting (2246 vs 2460 kWh/m²), electricity costs ($35.96-$105.22/m²/cycle, literature: $15.50-$121.56/m²/cycle), and electricity/GHG emissions (literature ranges largely overlapped).

**Limitations:** Simplifications due to data limitations. Geographic resolution limited to meteorology and electric grid mix; further refinement expected to minimally impact overall GHG emissions. Cradle-to-gate system boundary (excludes downstream processes).  Doesn't account for various cannabis product supply chains.
