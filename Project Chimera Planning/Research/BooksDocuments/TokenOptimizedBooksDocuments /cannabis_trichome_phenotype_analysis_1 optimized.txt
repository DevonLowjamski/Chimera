**Objective:** Automated trichome analysis to assess Cannabis sativa L. flower maturation.

**Methods:**  Deep learning pipeline using DO-U-Net for trichome gland segmentation and k-NN for phenotype (clear, milky, brown) classification from macroscopic images (visible light & UV fluorescence). Four strains: Afghan Kush, Green Death Bubba, Pink Kush, White Rhino.  840-720 images/strain.  Image acquisition: Canon 6D Mk. II, Canon MP-E 65 mm lens (3x macro), Vivitar 283 xenon flash (modified with Baader UV-pass filter for fluorescence).  Hydroponic cultivation in Health Canada-approved facility.  Experiments: Potassium bicarbonate (Milstop) spray; viroid-infected plants.

**Trichome Morphology:**  Metrics: Average distance to nearest trichome (ADT), density (trichomes/mm²), diameter (µm), clumping fraction (CF), roundness.

**Results:**

* **Phenotype Progression:** Clear trichomes dominant early (day 25 peak), milky peak at day 50-70 (strain-dependent), brown appears after day 50, increasing rapidly by day 65-75.
* **Diameter:** Increases to ~100-110 µm (milky), then decreases (~75-95 µm) in brown trichomes.
* **ADT:** Increases for most strains, reflecting bract tissue expansion; WR shows slight decrease, correlating with stunted growth.
* **Density:** Decreases over time for all strains (20-30 trichomes/mm² at harvest).
* **CF:** Varies by strain; higher in AK & GDB initially, decreasing with bract expansion; WR shows increase.
* **Roundness:** Decreases over time, indicating head degradation.
* **Fluorescence:** Peak fluorescence angle at day 40, followed by decline (red shift), especially pronounced in brown trichomes. Brown trichomes fluoresce green-blue. Intensity increases over time.
* **Milstop:** Increased browning, reduced milkiness, red-shifted fluorescence, reduced density and clumping. ADT unaffected.
* **Viroid Disease:** Significantly smaller trichomes (~80 µm vs. ~100 µm in healthy plants). Density unaffected.

**Validation:** Manual assessment of segmentation and classification accuracy. Experiments show Milstop and disease impact on trichome phenotype and morphology.

**Discussion:**

* Morphology metrics reflect bract tissue expansion and trichome maturation. ADT and CF inversely related.  Density reflects bract expansion and trichome detachment.
* Clear-milky transition likely due to changes in cuticle precursors and internal contents. Milky phenotype peak correlates with stalk elongation. Brown phenotype indicates senescence.
* Fluorescence differentiates phenotypes: Clear/milky show localized fluorescence (potentially cannabinoids); brown shows red-shifted fluorescence (potentially flavonoids).
* Milstop affects cuticle, inducing oxidative stress. Viroid disease leads to arrested trichome development and smaller trichomes.

**Conclusion:** Automated trichome analysis provides strain-agnostic metrics for assessing flower maturation and detecting stress/disease. Future work: 3D analysis, refined phenotype classification, bract tissue geometry analysis.
