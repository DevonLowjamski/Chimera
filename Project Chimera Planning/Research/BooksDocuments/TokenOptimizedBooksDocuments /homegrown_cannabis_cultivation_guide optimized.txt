Plant Growth Stages: Seedling (young, vulnerable), Vegetative (leaf/stem growth), Flowering (bud production). Each stage has unique, player-managed environmental/nutritional needs.

Cannabis Botany: Dioecious plant (male/female flowers on separate plants).  Parts: Taproot, fibrous secondary roots; central stalk, nodes (opposite/alternate branching), internodal spacing; palmately compound leaves (5-9 leaflets), sugar leaves; trichomes (bulbous, capitate sessile, capitate-stalked); male staminate flowers (anthers), female pistillate flowers (pistils, calyxes, ovaries); inflorescence (cola). Hermaphrodite plants contain both male and female flowers; cull immediately.

Cannabis Classification:  Hemp Varietals: *Cannabis sativa spp. sativa* (Narrow-leaf hemp, NLH), *Cannabis indica ssp. chinensis* (Broad-leaf hemp, BLH). Drug Varietals: *Cannabis indica spp. afghanica* (Broad-leaf drug, BLD), *Cannabis indica spp. indica* (Narrow-leaf drug, NLD), *Cannabis ruderalis spp. ruderalis* (autoflowers). Cultivars (intentionally bred for specific traits), Chemovars (chemical constituents & potency). Landraces (evolved in specific geographic locations).

Cannabis Effects:  Chart (Effects, Cannabinoids, Terpenes, Cultivars) omitted due to token constraints; refer to original document.

Life Cycle: Seed germination (1-2 weeks), Seedling (2-3 weeks), Vegetative (2-5 months outdoors, variable indoors), Flowering (4-6+ weeks), Seed maturation (4-6 weeks). Photoperiod-dependent vs. Autoflowering.

Tools & Equipment: Cell packs/propagation trays; pots (4-inch, 1-gallon, 5-10-20 gallon); potting soil (seed-starting mix, growing mix); water buckets; min/max thermometer/hygrometer; spray bottle; plant supports; measuring cups; air pump/aerator; strainer; funnel; pruning shears/secateurs; trimming scissors; rubbing alcohol; razor blade; gardening gloves; long-sleeved shirt; rubber gloves; string; drying screens/racks; kitchen scale; glass jars/resealable plastic bags; jewelry loupe/hand lens.  Indoor-specific: Humidity dome, heating mat, grow lights (fluorescent, LED, HID), pH meter/litmus paper.

Outdoor Growing Space Planning: Legality (check local laws); time/money commitment; access to outdoor space (sunlight, soil, water); security/privacy.

Indoor Growing Space Planning: Space requirements; location (room, basement, grow tent); electricity (circuit breakers, outlets); security/privacy; odor control; safety (fire, electricity, children, pets).

Indoor vs. Outdoor Growing: Pros & Cons of each omitted due to token constraints; refer to original document.  Hybrid approaches: Starting indoors, moving outdoors; pots on deck/balcony; hoop houses/greenhouses.

Outdoor Garden Setup: Space requirements; sun exposure (6+ hours); privacy/security; no-till gardening; companion planting (boost growth: alfalfa, chamomile, comfrey, coriander, valerian; repel insects: calendula, coriander, dill, peppermint, wormwood, yarrow; improve soil health: alfalfa, cerastium spp., chamomile, daikon radish, clover).

Indoor Garden Setup: Space selection; grow tents; lighting (fluorescents, LEDs, HIDs); timers; temperature (72-76°F [22-24.5°C]); humidity (50-60% vegetative, 40-50% flowering); air circulation; ventilation (air exchange, CFM calculation); safety (electricity, fire).

Soil & Nutrients: Soil requirements (well-drained, high organic matter, pH 5.5-6.5); macronutrients (N-P-K, Ca, Mg, S, C); micronutrients (Fe, B, Cu, Mn, Zn, Co, Cl, Mo); living soil; building living soils; foliar feeding; lactic acid bacteria serum (recipe omitted due to token constraints; refer to original document); soil amendments (alfalfa meal, bark mulch, biochar, blood meal, bone meal, coco coir, compost, dolomite lime, earthworm castings, farm animal manure, feather meal, fish meal, greensand, gypsum, humic acid ore, kelp meal, oyster shell, peat moss, rabbit manure, seabird/bat guano, soft rock phosphate, straw/hay mulch, topsoil, triple mix, volcanic mineral fertilizers, wood chips); mycorrhizal products; amendments for aeration (perlite, vermiculite); bottled nutrients; soil mixes (seed-starting mix, outdoor planting mixes [basic, variation, advanced], container plant mix, homemade organic soil mix).

Plant Care Techniques: Daily plant observation; plant journal; watering (water quality [TDS, ppm, chlorine, pH], practices); transplanting (pot size, timing, transplant shock, tips); mulching; plant supports; shade.

Seeds, Clones & Germination: Cultivar selection (needs, genetics, growing environment); seed selection (regular, feminized, autoflower); germination (paper towel method, direct planting); early seedling care (lighting, growing conditions, watering, nutrition, transplanting, hardening off); cloning (mother plant selection, rooting medium, rooting hormone, steps).

Vegetative Growth: Signs of vegetative growth; plant care (lighting, growing conditions, watering, nutrition [alfalfa pellets/dried alfalfa, plant teas [fermented, unfermented], compost/manure teas, fish fertilizer, bottled nutrients]); sex identification (pre-flowers, cloning); training/pruning (LST: bending, leaf tucking, ScrOG; HST: pinching, fimming, lollipopping, super cropping, main-lining); plant support (stakes, cages, trellis netting, high-tensile wire).

Flowering: Signs of flowering (early flower stretch, pistil color change, trichome development [clear, milky, amber], bud density, aroma); plant care (lighting, growing conditions, watering, nutrition [water-soluble calcium, liquid bone meal, fermented plant teas]); maintenance; breeding (parent plant selection, pollination methods [open, hand], seed collection/storage).

Harvest: Timing (pistil color, trichome observation); harvesting steps (plan, tools, inspection, preparation [de-fanning], cutting, trimming [wet vs. dry]); trimming workspace; how to trim; harvest tips.

Drying & Curing: Drying space setup (temperature [60-65°F (15-18°C)], humidity [55-60%], airflow); hanging plants; drying time frame (10-14 days); destalking; curing (environment, containers, burping, signs of curing).

Proper Storage: Container options (glass jars, oven bags, resealable bags, vacuum sealer); storage conditions (temperature [39-46°F (4-8°C)], humidity [55-63%]); long-term vs. short-term storage; storing untrimmed flowers; humidity control packets.

Planning Next Year’s Garden: End-of-season maintenance; cover crops; reflections (celebrations, cultivar notes, lessons learned, soil notes); future planning (garden goals, equipment, cultivar selection, growing schedule).

Common Pests, Diseases & Nutrient Imbalances: IPM protocol; plant observation; promoting plant health; harnessing biodiversity (companion plants, trap plants, banker plants); pest control (fungus gnats, two-spotted spider mites, thrips, broad mites/hemp russet mites, aphids/cannabis aphids, whiteflies, slugs/snails, mammals); disease control (powdery mildew, botrytis, pythium, fusarium); nutrient imbalances (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron).
