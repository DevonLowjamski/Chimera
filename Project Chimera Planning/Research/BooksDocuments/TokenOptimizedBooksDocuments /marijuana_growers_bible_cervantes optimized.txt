Plant Growth Stages: Seedling (young, vulnerable), Vegetative (leaf/stem growth), Flowering (bud production). Each stage has unique, player-managed environmental/nutritional needs.  Cannabis life cycle: Germination (3-7 days), Seedling (1 month), Vegetative (variable), Pre-Flowering (4-6 weeks), Flowering (6-10 weeks, pure sativas longer).  Flowering induced by 12/12 light/dark cycle.  Sinsemilla: unfertilized female plants.  Harvest when trichomes milky white to amber.  Drying: 65-75°F (18-24°C), 45-55% humidity, 5-7 days. Curing: slow drying in airtight container.  Clones: 10-20 days to root, 18-24 hours light.  Mother plants: 18-24 hours light.  Pruning: redirects growth hormones, best avoided 1 month pre-flowering.  Bending: alters hormone concentrations.  Stress: induces resin production, but reduces yield.  Security: secrecy paramount.  Avoid chemicals; use biocontrols.

Medical uses: glaucoma, muscle spasticity, pain syndromes, nausea, appetite stimulation. THC mimics anandamide; CBD modulates THC effects; terpenoids mitigate side effects.  Legal status: Schedule I drug (US Federal).  Safety: secure grow location; prevent odor, light leaks; avoid chemicals; use proper electrical grounding and fire safety.  Breeding:  Seed creation involves pollination of female ovules by male pollen.  Sex determination: 4th week of vegetative growth, 12/12 light cycle.  Hermaphrodites: both male and female flowers; undesirable for sinsemilla production.  Feminized seeds: hormone treatment induces pollen production in females.  Breeding goals: potency, yield, flavor, pest/disease resistance.  Inbreeding: repeated self-pollination; leads to inbreeding depression.  Outbreeding: crossing unrelated varieties; creates hybrid vigor.  Backcrossing: repeated crossing with recurrent parent; used to introgress traits.  Recurrent selection: repeated cycles of selection for desired traits.  Mutagenesis: inducing mutations via radiation or chemicals; unreliable for cannabis breeding.
