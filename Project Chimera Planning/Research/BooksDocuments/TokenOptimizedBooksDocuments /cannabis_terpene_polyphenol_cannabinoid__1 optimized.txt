Cannabis sativa L. (hemp) yields: fibers, seed oils, biomass (pharmaceutical, cosmetic, paper, textile, construction, food, animal feed, phytoremediation, biofuel, varnishes, inks).  Composition: carbohydrates, terpenoids, alkaloids, stilbenoids, quinones, flavonoids, fatty acids, phenols, cannabinoids.  Phytocannabinoids: CBD (non-psychoactive, USD 1.9B market in 2018, projected 49% growth by 2024), cannabigerol, cannabichromene, cannabinol, cannabicyclol, cannabinodiol, THC (psychoactive).  Phytocannabinoid activity: anti-epileptic, anticonvulsive, anti-neurodegenerative, antiemetic, analgesic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory. Acid cannabinoids (low CAR binding); neutral cannabinoids (high CAR binding, psychological activity). Decarboxylation crucial for pharmacological activity (heat/light). ~140 terpenoids (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, waxes, resins, oxygenated terpenoids). Terpenoid yields: 0.01–1.5% inflorescence dry weight.  Volatile fraction: α-pinene, myrcene, terpinolene, E-caryophyllene, α-humulene, caryophyllene oxide.  Conventional extraction (maceration, percolation, Soxhlet, hydro/steam distillation): high energy, long times, partial recovery. Innovative techniques: microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), ultrasound (US), pressurized-liquid, supercritical-fluid extraction, instant controlled pressure-drop.  MW advantages: rapid heating, short time, reduced solvent, high reproducibility, higher extraction rates, increased yield (enhanced heat/mass transfer).

MAHD (Microwave-assisted hydrodistillation): efficient Cannabis terpene recovery (even heating).  ETHOS X reactor (1800W max power, 12L vessel, IR sensor). Optimized MAHD: 500W (3min), 1100W (3min), 1600W (14min), 1500W (90min) = 1h 50min. 2.5–2.8kg matrix. Matrix-to-liquid ratios: 1/0.5–1/1.5 (kg/L). Water types tested: tap, deionized, 20% NaCl.  Optimal MAHD (Test 2): tap water, 1:1 ratio, 0.35 ± 0.02% w/w hydrodistillate (dry inflorescence), 0.24 ± 0.02% w/w (dry matrix). CHD (Conventional hydrodistillation): 0.12 ± 0.01% w/w (dry inflorescence), 0.08 ± 0.01% w/w (dry matrix). MAHD phytocannabinoid decarboxylation: ~70% (THC: 69.01 ± 0.98%, CBD: 74.32 ± 1.02%).  Residual matrix suitable for ethanolic extraction.

Materials: Ethanol (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), Methanol (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), Milli-Q H2O, Cannabis Terpenes Mix A/B, cannabidiol, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, gallic acid, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, catechin, epicatechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin-3-O-glucoside (Sigma-Aldrich), Folin–Ciocalteau reagent, sodium carbonate. Cannabis sativa L. cv. Monoica (Egeria s.r.l., Milano, Italy; Azienda Agricola Prina Pietro, Pavia, Italy).  Inflorescence content: 73.70% ± 3.22% w/w. Water content: 69.97% ± 2.63% w/w (inflorescence: 71.15% ± 0.98%, stalks/leaves: 59.72% ± 0.89%).

GC-MS: Agilent Technologies 6850 Network GC System, 5973 Network Mass Selective Detector, 7683B Automatic Sampler, Mega 5MS capillary column. Compound identification: retention time/mass spectrum comparison with standards, Wiley275 & NIST05 GC libraries (≥95% match). UPLC-MS/MS: Waters Acquity TQD UPLC-MS/MS system, Waters BEH C18 column. HPLC-DAD: Waters HPLC system, diode array detector, automatic sampler, Synergi Hydro RP C18 column.  Statistical analysis: Statistica (Statsoft Inc.) v.10, Tukey’s HSD test (p<0.05).

MAHD Test variations:  Water ratio (1/0.5, 1/1, 1/1.5); water type (deionized, tap, 20% NaCl); hot water (50°C); cotton bag; PEEK net; matrix movement; Vigreux column.  Water after MAHD: TPC (Total phenolic content): 1.49 ± 0.02 mg polyphenols/g matrix; 53.54 ± 2.35 mg polyphenols/g extract (5.35 ± 0.23% w/w). Polyphenol enrichment (SPE): 10.31 ± 0.45% w/w (dry raw extract); TPC: 51.71 ± 2.25% w/w (dry purified sample). HPLC-DAD: luteolin-7-O-glucoside (2.84 ± 0.12% w/w), apigenin-7-O-glucoside (2.58 ± 0.11% w/w) (dry purified fraction).  MAHG (Microwave-assisted hydrodiffusion and gravity): inefficient cannabinoid extraction (4.65 ± 0.26% w/w dry extract, low CBD/THC).

Conclusion: MAHD efficiently processes >2.5kg Cannabis/cycle. Yields terpene-rich hydrodistillate, polyphenol-rich water, and highly decarboxylated phytocannabinoids. Solvent-free, sustainable.  CHD yields less oil, different terpene profile.  MAHG inefficient for cannabinoid extraction.
