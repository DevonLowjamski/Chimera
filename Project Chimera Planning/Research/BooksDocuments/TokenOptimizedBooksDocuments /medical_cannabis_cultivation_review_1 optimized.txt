Medical Cannabis Cultivation Review:

**Phytocannabinoids:**  Active substances; biosynthesis understood, environmental influence on type/number less studied.  ~150 known compounds (Hanuš et al. 2016).  Key examples: Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), cannabidiol (CBD). Therapeutic applications numerous (chronic pain, nausea, spasticity, depression, glaucoma, IBD, Parkinson's symptoms, anxiety, sleep disorders).

**Taxonomy:**  Cannabis sativa L. debated classification.  Linnaeus (1753): single species.  Lamarck (1786): Cannabis indica. Janischevsky (1924): Cannabis ruderalis.  Small & Cronquist (1976): four groups (C. sativa subsp. sativa var. sativa, C. sativa subsp. sativa var. spontanea, C. sativa subsp. indica var. indica, C. sativa subsp. indica var. kafiristanica). Hillig (2005): multi-species (C. sativa, C. indica, C. ruderalis).  Small (2015): two classifications (one following International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants; second for domesticated cannabis, following International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants).  Hillig & Mahlberg (2004): biotypes (hemp, drug – narrow-leaflet, wide-leaflet).  Zhang et al. (2018), McPartland (2018):  Cannabis as monotypic species (C. sativa), three subspecies (subsp. sativa, subsp. indica, subsp. ruderalis).

**Cannabinoid Biosynthesis:**  Neutral cannabinoids, cannabinoid acids (carboxyl group number).  Non-enzymatic decarboxylation during storage/heating.  Phytocannabinoids: prenylated polyketides; fatty acid precursors, isoprenoids.  Monoterpenic unit attached to phenolic ring (Dewick 2002).  Alkyl side chain (1–5 carbons); n-pentyl most abundant (Elsohly & Slade 2005).  n-propyl side chain: cannabivarins (THCV in C. indica).  Starting materials: malonyl-CoA (3), hexanoyl-CoA (1).  Olivetolic acid via tetraketide synthase (TKS), olivetolic acid cyclase enzyme (OAC). CBGA (geranylpyrophosphate), CBNRA (neryl pyrophosphate) via geranylpyrophosphate:olivetolate geranyltransferase (GOT).  THCA via THCA synthase (CBGA/CBNRA). CBDA via CBDA synthase (CBGA). CBCA via CBCA synthase (CBGA).  Primary phytocannabinoids: Δ9-THCA, CBDA, CBCA.  Secondary phytocannabinoids via decarboxylation or light/heat/oxygen exposure (CBN, CBE, CBT, Δ8-THC, CBL). CBDA/THCA synthase similar catalytic rates/affinity; CBCA synthase lower KM, higher kcat. CBGA concentration influences THCA/CBDA/CBCA biosynthesis.  Cannabivarins from CBGVA. Cannabinoid profile changes rapidly in early growth (Potter 2014).


**Cultivation:** European cannabis mostly industrial (hemp fiber, seed oil, protein).  Medical cannabis cultivation requires stringent protocols. Factors influencing phytocannabinoid composition/yield: genotype, growing conditions, harvest maturity, storage, handling (Potter 2014). Greenhouse cultivation more efficient than outdoor (control over light, temperature, humidity; reduced pest/disease risk).  Indoor cultivation uses automated lighting/photoperiod, temperature, ventilation, irrigation, nutrient systems.  Multiple harvests per year possible (Leggett 2006).  Hydroponics vs. soil: no significant phytocannabinoid potency/biomass increase with hydroponics (Potter 2014).

**Vegetation Cycle:** Short-day plant; flowering regulated by phytochromes. Vegetative phase: 2–4 weeks; 70–80% relative humidity, 21–28°C (Chandra et al. 2008). Generative phase: 12h light/12h dark; first flowers ~1 week after photoperiod reduction; 40% humidity to reduce fungal disease (Vanhove et al. 2011, 2012). Average flowering time: 57 days (Carpentier et al. 2012).

**CO2 Concentration:** Increased CO2 during light phase improves photosynthesis/growth/biomass yield (Kimball 1983, Wheeler et al. 1996, Chandra et al. 2008, 2011).  Effects species/variety-specific (Minorsky 2002). High CO2 increases photosynthesis thermotolerance in C3 plants, except at supra-optimal growth temperatures (Wang et al. 2008, Hamilton et al. 2008).  Chandra et al. (2011): 700 ppm CO2 increased Cannabis sativa photosynthesis by 38–48%, improved water uptake.

**Artificial Light:** Light intensity (lumens/m2, watts/m2), wavelength important. Vegetative phase: 420–460 nm (blue); flowering phase: 600–680 nm (red) (Mahlberg & Hemphill 1983).  Lighting types: T-5 fluorescent, metal halide (MH), high-pressure sodium (HPS), light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Potter & Duncombe (2012): maximum harvest at 600 W/m2; no significant THC increase with increased light intensity. Toonen et al. (2006): higher yields with 600 W lamps than 400 W.  Photosynthesis rate plateaus above 100 W/m2 PAR (Lydon et al. 1987). Magagnini et al. (2018): HPS plants taller, more dry matter; LED plants higher CBD/THC. Namdar et al. (2019): increased CBGA in LED-grown inflorescences (CBGA:THCA 1:2 vs. 1:16 under HPS). LEDs energy-efficient, less heat, long life, wavelength specificity (Massa et al. 2008).  Optimal photosynthesis temperature: 25–30°C (Bazzaz et al. 1975).

**Nutrition:** Limited experimental data. Hemp cultivation data suggests nutrient application affects cannabinoid content/yield.  Macronutrients: N (NO3–, NH4+), P (H2PO4–, HPO42–), K+, Ca2+, SO42–, Mg2+. Micronutrients: Fe2+, Fe3+, Cl–, Mn2+, Zn2+, Cu+, Cu2+, H3BO3, H2BO3–, MoO42–, Ni2+.  N: positive correlation with THC content in hemp vegetative parts (Haney & Kutscheid 1973); high N reduces THC in leaves (Bócsa et al. 1997). Optimal N in soil: 50–200 kg/ha (Vera et al. 2004, Aubin et al. 2015); hydroponic/soil: 190–400 mg N/L. P: positive correlation with hemp THC, negative with CBD (Coffman & Gentner 1975, 1977); no positive effect on THC, CBD, CBN, CBG in medical cannabis buds (Bernstein et al. 2019b). K: response highly genotype-dependent (Saloner et al. 2019); competition between K, Ca, Mg; little effect on micronutrient accumulation. Caplan et al. (2017a, b): optimal NPK ratios during vegetative/generative phases. Bernstein et al. (2019b): increased NPK increased CBG, decreased CBN. Control nutrient concentrations: 65 ppm N, 17 ppm P, 90 ppm K.  Mg: negative correlation with Δ9-THC, CBD; positive with Δ8-THC (Coffman & Gentner 1975, Pate 1994, Radosavljevic-Stevanovic et al. 2014). Fe: positive correlation with Δ8-THC; negative with CBD (Pate 1994, Radosavljevic-Stevanovic et al. 2014). Mn: positive correlation with CBN (Pate 1994, Radosavljevic-Stevanovic et al. 2014).  Catalase (heme iron) decomposes H2O2; Cr negatively correlated with CBD.  Bernstein et al. (2019a): cannabinoid concentration increases with plant height, highest in flowers/inflorescence leaves. Nutrient distribution typical of plant uptake/translocation.

**pH:** Optimal range: 5.5–6.5. Hydroponics: 5.5–6.0 (max absorption at 5.8) (Velazquez et al. 2013). Growing substrate: 5.8–7.2 (max absorption at 6.5) (Caplan et al. 2017a).  pH outside optimal range affects nutrient availability.

**Plant Biostimulants:** Substances/microorganisms increasing abiotic stress tolerance, nutritional efficiency, crop quality (Du Jardin 2015). Humic/fulvic acids: positive effects on height, chlorophyll, photosynthesis after water stress (Da Cunha Leme Filho et al. 2020); negative effect on THC/CBD (Bernstein et al. 2019b).  Mammoth P™ microbial biostimulant promoted growth during blooming (Conant et al. 2017).  Plant growth-promoting bacteria may affect phytocannabinoid accumulation, yield, disease resistance (Lyu et al. 2019).

**Conclusions:** Indoor cultivation best for medical cannabis due to safety, environmental control, yield homogeneity.  Light, CO2, humidity key growing conditions. Nutrient ratios/availability significantly influence cannabinoid content/type, alongside genotype and microclimate.  Future research needed on nutrient effects, indoor cultivation techniques, automation.
