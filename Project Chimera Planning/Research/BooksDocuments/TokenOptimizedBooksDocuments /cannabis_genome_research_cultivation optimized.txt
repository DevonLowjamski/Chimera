Cannabis sativa genome research:  THC/CBD biosynthesis linked to two distinct genes on chromosome 6, separated by ~20 million nucleotides.  Purple Kush (marijuana) has functional THC synthase gene; Finola (hemp) has functional CBD synthase gene.  Hemp's low THC levels possibly due to vestigial THC-producing genes from retroelements.  Gene responsible for CBC synthesis (anti-inflammatory) identified: 96% DNA/93% protein similarity to THC synthase.  New genes identified for cannabinoid production.  Genome data enables marker-assisted selection for desired traits (THC/CBD content, flower structure, disease resistance, nutrient uptake).  Genetic engineering (e.g., CRISPR) aims to create THC/CBD-free plants and increase cannabinoid production plant-wide (increased yield, faster harvest).  Synthetic biology methods produce cannabinoids (e.g., CBC) in yeast/bacteria.  Predictive changes in cannabis industry within 3 years:  replacement of current strains with new varieties via marker-assisted hybridization and trait-based selection.  US Farm Bill (2018): Hemp <0.3% THC (dry weight).
