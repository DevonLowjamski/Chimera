Plant Growth Stages: Seedling (young, vulnerable), Vegetative (leaf/stem growth), Flowering (bud production). Each stage has unique, player-managed environmental/nutritional needs.  Dioecious (male/female plants); hermaphrodites possible from stress.  Flowering triggered by uninterrupted darkness (9-11.5 hrs, depending on variety).  Indica (short, bushy, pungent, relaxing high), Sativa (tall, conical, sweet/tangy, psychedelic high), Ruderalis (auto-flowering).  Kush: Indica variant.  Modern varieties are hybrids, domesticated for high THC, fast ripening, large buds.

Marijuana High: Δ9-THC & other cannabinoids bind to CB1 (neurological effects) & CB2 (anti-inflammatory) receptors. Endocannabinoids (eCBs): anandamide & 2-AG, regulate neuronal activity (neuroprotection).  Terpenes: essential oils (myrcene, limonene, β-caryophyllene, pinene, terpineol, borneol, Δ-3-carene, linalool, pulegone, cineole), affect high & medicinal properties, odor varies by variety, maturity, time of day, climate.

Plant Needs: Light (400-700nm PAR; red & blue most efficient; UVB increases THC; measure in µmol/sq m/s or DLI), CO2 (380-1500 ppm; increase with light intensity; tanks, generators, dry ice), Water (125-150 ppm dissolved solids; pH 5.8-6.3; alkalinity, Ca, Mg, K), Nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, B, Cu, Mn, Zn, Mo; deficiencies cause characteristic symptoms; EC/ppm/pH meters), Temperature (70-85°F; adjust with light intensity; cooling systems).

Garden Setup: Goals (yield, specific strains, medical use, breeding, hobby).  Space (tiny: closet, box; large: warehouse; premade units).  Light (fluorescents, MH, HPS, LEDs; reflectors, ballasts, light movers).  CO2 (tanks, generators).  Temperature/Humidity (fans, AC, dehumidifiers, misters).  Security (discretion, legal knowledge, odor control: carbon filters, negative ions, ozone generators; trash management).

Growing: Seeds (feminized for female plants only; germination; seedling care; transplanting).  Clones (from female plants; rooting methods: water, aeroponics; humidity).  Vegetative Growth (high N fertilizer; pruning: topping, lollipopping, fimming, bending, supercropping; leaf removal).  Flowering (12 hrs light/12 hrs dark; light deprivation for early/multiple harvests; UVB light).

Harvest: Whole plant or individual buds (ripening indicators: trichome color/shape, stigma color, aroma); Manicuring (tools, methods, efficiency; kief collection).  Curing (60-70°F, 50% humidity; drying methods; bud dryness tests; storage).

Post-Harvest: Kief (screening; Pollinator); Water Hash (Ice-o-lator, Bubble Bags); Hashish (pressing); Capsules; Edibles (infused butter/oil; decarboxylation). Cleaning (BioGreenClean, hydrogen peroxide).

Pests/Diseases: Ants (moats, spices, boric acid, diatomaceous earth); Aphids (parasitoids, predators, oils, soaps, pyrethrum); Caterpillars (row covers, BT, neem oil, spinosad); Deer (repellents, fencing); Fungus Gnats (barriers, nematodes, diatomaceous earth); Leaf Miners (removal, parasitic wasps); Mealybugs/Scale (alcohol, oils, predators); Moles (fumigation, traps); Rats (traps, poison); Slugs/Snails (iron phosphate, copper); Spider Mites (humidity, soaps, oils, predators, sulfur); Thrips (barriers, nematodes, oils); Whiteflies (sticky traps, parasitic wasps, oils). Algae (prevent light), Botrytis (humidity control, fungicides), Powdery Mildew (humidity, fungicides), Fusarium (sterile medium), Verticillium (well-drained soil), Pythium (healthy plants), Damping Off (well-drained soil, fungicides).

Legal Considerations: Federal laws prohibit cultivation; state laws vary (plant limits, possession limits).  Avoid suspicious behavior, protect privacy (phone, internet). Know your rights (remain silent, request attorney).
