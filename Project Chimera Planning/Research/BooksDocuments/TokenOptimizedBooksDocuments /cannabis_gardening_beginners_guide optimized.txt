**Cannabis Overview:**  Useful plant; legal status varies;  cultivation for personal use increasingly legal;  multiple uses (fiber, food, medicine, recreational).

**Plant History:** Originated in central Asia;  adapted to diverse climates via human cultivation;  landraces (e.g., Hindu Kush, Acapulco Gold) represent regionally adapted varieties;  modern uses include fiber, food, medicine, building materials, fuel.

**Cultivar Selection:**  Determine desired harvest outcome (e.g., high THC, high CBD, pain relief); consider cultivar suitability for local climate (USDA/Sunset zones, Köppen classification).  Factors influencing effects: cannabinoid & terpene profile (not just sativa/indica).  Entourage effect: synergistic interaction of cannabinoids & terpenes.

**Endocannabinoid System (ECS):** Master regulatory system;  influences numerous physiological & mental processes;  CB1 & CB2 receptors;  cannabinoids (endocannabinoids & phytocannabinoids) interact with ECS.

**Cannabinoids:** THC (euphoria, anti-inflammatory, pain relief, appetite stimulant); CBD (non-intoxicating, anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, anti-seizure); THCa (non-intoxicating, anti-inflammatory); CBDa (anti-inflammatory, anti-convulsant); CBN (sedative); CBG (pain relief, inflammation); CBC (pain relief, inflammation, neuroprotective).

**Terpenes:**  Influence cannabinoid effects; contribute to aroma;  examples: myrcene, pinene, linalool, caryophyllene, geraniol, limonene, humulene.

**Cannabis & Health:** ECS implicated in nearly all human diseases;  cannabis may offer therapeutic potential;  research ongoing;  anecdotal evidence supports safety & effectiveness.

**Cultivar Choice Factors:** Desired effects (sleep, pain relief, inflammation, anxiety, euphoria); cannabinoid and terpene profiles;  THC:CBD ratio;  cultivar growth characteristics (sativa/indica traits, maturity time, mold resistance).  Example Cultivars: Purple Urkle, Granddaddy Purple, Tahoe OG Kush, Pennywise 1:1, Harlequin, Sweet Annie 1:1, Cannatonic, ACDC, Medihaze, CBD Critical Mass, Magic Jordan, Destroyer, Blue Dream, Sour Diesel.

**Cannabis vs. Hemp:**  Same species, different legal definitions;  hemp (<0.3% THC);  cannabis (>0.3% THC);  modern breeding blurs lines.

**Climate Zone Considerations:**  Match cultivars to local climate zones (USDA, Sunset, Köppen); address climate-specific challenges (e.g., mold resistance for cool, moist climates; drought tolerance for hot, dry climates).

**Garden Design:** Container gardening (minimum 5-gallon pots; terra cotta, felt, ceramic, plastic, metal, wood, concrete); raised beds (rich soil, ample space, companion planting); integrating cannabis into existing gardens (perennial beds, cutting gardens, herb gardens);  companion plants (mint, lemon verbena, lavender, sweet peas).

**Legal Considerations:**  State and local laws vary;  check legality before planting;  age restrictions;  NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) as a resource.  Example grow plan: 5 plants (2 in 20-gallon pots, 3 in-ground).

**Space Requirements:** Each plant needs 6+ hours of direct sunlight;  6-9+ feet tall and wide at maturity; visualize space needed using body as a guide;  consider companion planting to maximize space utilization.

**Yield:** Up to 1 pound of dried bud per outdoor plant.

**Four Essential Elements:** Sun (6+ hours direct sunlight); Soil (rich, well-draining, amended with compost;  macro- and micronutrients); Air (good air circulation); Water (adequate moisture).
