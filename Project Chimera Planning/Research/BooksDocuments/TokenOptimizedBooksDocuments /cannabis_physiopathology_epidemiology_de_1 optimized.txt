Section I: Physiopathology

1. Toxicology: Marijuana smoke mutagenic (Ames test, tissue culture); cannabinoids inhibit macromolecular biosynthesis. THC/marijuana: neurobehavioral toxicity, gonadal/reproductive disruption, fetotoxicity; smoke inhalation: airway obstruction, squamous metaplasia. Clinical manifestations: long-term memory impairment (adolescents); psychomotor impairment (lethal train/car accidents, aviation); increased schizophrenia incidence (6x); cancers (mouth, jaw, tongue, lung; 19-30 year olds); non-lymphoblastic leukemia (children of smoking mothers). Keywords: Marijuana, mutagenicity, fetotoxicity, neurobehavioral toxicity, memory impairment, performance, schizophrenia, cancer, leukemia.

2. Brain Alterations (PET): Acute cocaine: decreased brain metabolic activity (cortical, subcortical). Chronic cocaine: decreased cerebral blood flow (frontal cortex, left hemisphere); increased metabolic activity (orbito-frontal cortex, basal ganglia; early withdrawal). Alcohol intoxication: decreased whole brain metabolic activity (frontal, parietal lobes). THC (2 mg i.v.): increased cerebellar metabolic activity (smaller increase in chronic users); increased frontal lobe metabolic activity (chronic users). Keywords: Marijuana; cocaine; alcohol; PET; glucose metabolism; cerebellum; cerebral circulation.

3. Psychomotor Performance: Marijuana impairs complex psychomotor performance (up to 24 hr post-low/moderate dose); cumulative impairment (marijuana, age, task difficulty). Keywords: psychomotor performance, working memory, cognitive factors, human-machine interface, marijuana.

4. Psychopathology & Behavior: Cannabis triggers acute psychotic episodes in schizophrenics; increased schizophrenia risk (6x; heavy users); long-lasting mental disturbances.  Keywords: Marijuana, delta-9-THC, adolescents, memory, Benton Visual Retention Test, Wechsler Memory Scale.  Chronic cannabis: diminished attention, impaired short-term memory. Cocaine abuse: persistent short-term memory disturbances.

5. Immune Function & Carcinogenesis: Cannabinoids inhibit cellular immunity, macrophage function; marijuana smoke mutagenic (Ames test); lung tissue damage, decreased pulmonary macrophage activity; airway obstruction, squamous cell hyperplasia; head and neck cancer (young patients, daily marijuana use); respiratory tract cancer (daily marijuana use); metastatic lung carcinoma (heavy marijuana use since age 11). Keywords: Marijuana, delta-9-THC, macrophages, carcinogenesis, immunodeficiency, cancer, leukemia.

6. Reproductive Function: Cannabis impairs oogenesis, spermatogenesis, prenatal development; reduced fertility, increased pre- and postnatal death, reduced litter size (mice); shorter height, lower weight, smaller head circumference (infants born to marijuana-smoking mothers).  Mechanism: hypothalamic action (LH-RH release inhibited). Keywords: Cannabis; gametogenesis; embryogenesis; fetal development; postnatal behavioral effects.


Section II: Epidemiology

North America: Dramatic reduction in marijuana use (U.S., Canada); less interest in decriminalization. Latin America: Cannabis introduced early; widespread use (Mexico, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Colombia, Brazil); acute/chronic psychological syndromes (anxiety, panic, paranoia, delirium, schizophreniform, apathy).  Sweden: Restrictive drug policy; low drug use among young people; high drug use among older age groups. France: Approximately one-third offered cannabis; one million regular/occasional users (mostly male, young, urban, college graduates); pleasure/improved mood (motivation); parental reactions (concern, disapproval, understanding, indifference, approval).  

Section III: Detection, Identification and Testing

Identification: Urine screening (immunoassay; 11 THC carboxylic acid); confirmation (GC/MS).  Quantitative analysis: blood plasma (intoxication, ingestion time).  Interferences: endogenous substances, other drugs.  Errors: false positive/negative results. Testing: urinalysis (marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, barbiturates, PCP, opiates, benzodiazepines, methaqualone); confirmation (GC/MS). Blood testing: more invasive, expensive; marijuana not detectable in blood after 1 day. Salivary THC correlates with intoxication and heart rate. Passive smoking: detectable cannabinoid metabolites at high thresholds only in highly specific situations.  Opiate/cocaine metabolites: detectable 4-5 days post-cessation. Cannabinoid metabolites: 3-5 days after occasional use, up to 77 days after chronic use.  Dutch Drug Policy: Increased cannabis use among adolescents; methadone distribution, needle exchange (ambiguous results, no crime reduction, no effect on cocaine use). Quality Control: Intralaboratory, external proficiency testing.

Appendix

Moreau's hashish experiments: acute mental confusion (acute brain syndrome);  eight cardinal symptoms (bliss, excitement, errors of time/space, enhanced hearing, delusions, emotional disturbance, irresistible impulses, illusions/hallucinations); primarily organic nature of mental illness.  Ants (THC/LSD): impaired social behavior.  Lognormal distribution of drug use: alcohol (lower dispersion), other drugs (higher dispersion); implications for social control.  Cannabis use: higher incidence of violent crimes and suicides than other drugs.  Swedish drug epidemic: restrictive policy resulted in decreased drug use.
