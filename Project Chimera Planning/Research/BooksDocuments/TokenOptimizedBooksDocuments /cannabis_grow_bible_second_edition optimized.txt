**Chapter 1: The Cannabis Plant**

* Brief History: Originated Himalayas, spread via wind, animals, birds; archaeological evidence (fibers, pollen, seeds, trichomes) dates back millennia.
* Landrace: Genetically diverse, stable populations adapted to local environments; examples: Afghani, Kush, Master Kush, Hash Plant.
* Law: Eradication efforts unsuccessful; plants survive in hidden grow spaces.
* The High: THC (delta-8 & delta-9) primary psychoactive component; levels genetically determined, quantities influenced by bud mass; resin glands (trichomes) contain THC; Zero Zero hash (highest grade).
* Plant: Male (low THC), female (THC, seeds), hermaphrodite (both sexes, self-pollinating), sinsemilla (seedless female, high yield).
* Species: Scientific debate (Cannabis sativa L. vs. multiple species); current consensus: Cannabis sativa L. with subspecies indica and sativa.
* Reproduction: Dioecious (separate sexes), monecious (both sexes on one plant), hermaphrodites; sinsemilla maximizes yield.
* Life Cycle: Germination, seedling, vegetative growth (24/0 or 18/6 photoperiod), pre-flowering (calyx development, sexing), flowering (12/12 photoperiod), seed production.  Cycle times: 10-36 weeks.

**Chapter 2: Seeds: Selection, Banks, and Storage**

* Selection: Consider strain type (Sativa, Indica, hybrids), indoor/outdoor suitability, flowering period, breeder reputation;  research seed banks.
* Acquisition: Obtain from trusted growers or reputable online seed banks (verify legitimacy, shipping, prices, reviews).
* Storage: Short-term: dry film canister; Long-term: airtight container, freezer.

**Chapter 3: Propagation and Germination**

* Propagation: Entire growing process; logistics depend on grow area and budget (seeds vs. clones).

* Seed Structure: Dicotyledons (cotyledons, plumule, radicle, epicotyl, hypocotyl); albuminous seeds.
* Germination Process: Imbibing (water uptake), light penetration; inhibitors (soil, pH, exposure, depth, weeds, nutrients, damage, fungi).
* Transplanting:  Maintain root integrity; methods: cutting pot base, dry soil removal, inverted pot tapping; transplant shock (avoid by careful handling, avoid feeding for one week).

**Chapter 4: The Great Divide: Indoors or Outdoors**

* Gardening Tools: Light source, nutrients, soil/medium, rockwool cubes, shovel/trowel, support sticks, water system, fertilizers, propagation trays, pots, scissors/knife, pest control, thread.
* Indoor Growing: Lighting crucial; HID (MH, HPS) recommended; wattage/lumens calculations; reflectors, white paint/Mylar for light reflection; 24/0 or 18/6 vegetative photoperiod; electrical costs.
* Outdoor Growing: Site selection (security, light, water); guerrilla farming techniques; security (avoid tracks, camouflage, stealth harvesting).

**Chapter 5: Organic Farming**

* Definition: No synthetics (nutrients, fertilizers, pesticides, hormones, GMOs); uses compost, natural pest control.
* History: Religious roots, industrialization, WWII chemical advancements, IFOAM (GMO-free).

**Chapter 6: The Indoor Growing Environment**

* Setups: Soil, hydroponics; advanced: SOG, ScrOG, cabinet growing.
* Lighting: HID kits (bulb, reflector, ballast, timer); color bands (CCT, CRI); photosynthesis (chlorophyll); common lighting types (domestic, fluorescent, halogen, MH, HPS); wattage/lumens calculations.
* Soil: pH (7), nutrients (NPK, CaMgS, micronutrients), composition (clay, humus, sand, silt, loam, perlite, vermiculite, moss); mixing ratios; pots (perforated).

**Chapter 7: Indoor Environmental Control**

* Nutrient Control: NPK, CaMgS, micronutrients; feeding schedules (seedlings, vegetative, flowering); problematic nutrients (Mg); macronutrient disorders (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S); feeding; nutrient strengths (30-50%).
* Soil Control: pH monitoring (6-8); adjustment (lime, lemon peels, coffee grounds, acidic fertilizer); pH up/down; soil flushing.
* Water Control: Watering frequency; underwatering/overwatering symptoms.
* Air Control: Ventilation (intake, vent, fans); odor control (ionizing, ozone, activated carbon filters).
* CO2: Supplementing; calculations; climate controllers.

**Chapter 8: Pre-flowering and Flowering**

* Pre-flowering: Calyx development; early sexing methods (height, calyxes, force-flowering).
* Flowering: 12/12 photoperiod; problems (hermaphrodites, abnormal bud growth); sexing plants; male flowering; female flowering; harvest indicators (pistil color change, trichome withering, bud mass plateau).

**Chapter 9: Advanced Indoor Soil-Based Grow Methods**

* Clone Mother: Selecting, propagating, maintaining.
* SOG: High plant density; short vegetative period.
* ScrOG: Fewer plants, screen for even canopy.  Real High’s method.
