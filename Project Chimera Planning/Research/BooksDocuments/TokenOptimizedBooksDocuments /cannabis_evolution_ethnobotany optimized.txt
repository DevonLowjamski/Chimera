Cannabis: Evolution and Ethnobotany

Introduction to the Multipurpose Plant Cannabis:  Cannabis has diverse uses: fiber, food, paper, medicine, ritual, recreation.

In the Beginning:  Hypothetical scenario: Central Asia, nomadic group, springtime, river valley settlement.  Cannabis naturally colonized disturbed, nutrient-rich soil. Women gathered seeds for food, leading to unintentional cultivation.  Fiber extraction and fish trapping developed. Psychoactive properties discovered (possibly accidental ingestion).  Multiple uses recognized: food, fiber, medicine, psychoactive.

Natural Origins and Early Evolution of Cannabis:  Cannabis: tall, erect, annual herb; adaptable to various environments; photoperiod influences flowering; dioecious (separate male/female plants); anemophilous (wind-pollinated).  Environmental requirements: sunlight, temperature (65-80°F), water (well-drained soil), soil (nutrient-rich).  Vavilov: Central Asian origin; criteria for wild Cannabis: slow/irregular germination; persistent seed coat; seed dispersal mechanisms; inflorescence shattering.  South Asian origin theories (Sharma): Himalayan foothills; challenges to diversity as origin criterion.  Model: Cannabaceae ancestor (140 mya); Cannabis/Humulus divergence; human impact.

Ethnobotanical Origins, Early Cultivation, and Evolution through Human Selection: Transition from foraging to cultivation; Cannabis a candidate for early cultivation; multiple uses (fiber, seed, resin).  Disruptive selection: fiber (long internodes, sparse branching) vs. drug/seed (short internodes, profuse branching); cannabinoid profile (high THC in drug vs. low in fiber).  Origin from weedy populations: Cannabis a successful weed; limited introgression (gene flow). Artificial hybridization: deliberate crosses (e.g., Chinese BLH x European NLH).  Atavism: reappearance of ancestral traits. Isolation of populations: dioecy limits self-fertilization; geographical isolation and disruptive selection maintain diversity. Population size and variability: early domestication increased variability; later selection narrowed variability.  Evolutionary effects of dioecy: outcrossing; resource allocation; predator/parasite control.  Seeds:  nonshattering; size; color; germination; oil/protein content. Fibers: length; flexibility; yield; branching. Inflorescences: size; resin glands; THC. Cannabinoid profile: THC/CBD ratio; geographic variation; selection; acclimatization.

The Cultural Diffusion of Cannabis: Methodology: multidisciplinary (archeobotany, archeology, history, linguistics, genetics).  Archaeobotanical evidence: seeds (most reliable), fibers (difficult to identify), pollen (Humulus/Cannabis confusion), fiber/seed impressions, trichomes, carbonized remains, cannabinoids.   Written records: limitations in accuracy and dating. Nonhuman agencies: limited dispersal via wind/water/animals.   Human impact: primary dispersal agent. Early Central Asian relationships: fishing and hemp; hemp, humans, and horses; Scythians and Cannabis.  Archaeological/historical evidence: East Asia; dispersal from northeastern China to Korea and Japan; South Asia; Southwest Asia and Egypt; Europe and the Mediterranean (Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Baltic Region, Finland, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Switzerland, Northern France, Iberian Peninsula, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, British Isles, Mediterranean Region).  Dispersal phases: Eurasia, Africa, New World (six-phase model).

History of Cannabis Use for Fiber: Textile basics: Cannabis a primary source; differences between East Asian and European processing.  Historical evidence for Cannabis fiber use in China: early cultivation; written records; textiles; lacquerware; weapons; ships. Traditional Korea: early cultivation; contemporary uses. Ancient Japan and hemp: Jomon and Yayoi cultivation; ritual use. Ancient evidence for fiber use: South Asia; Southwest Asia and Egypt; Ancient Mediterranean region; Ancient Europe north of the Mediterranean; Spread of hemp fiber use to the New World; Some aspects of the modern history of hemp.

Food, Feed, and Oil Uses of Hemp: Nutritional value of hemp seeds; EFAs. Early hemp seed use in China: Neolithic period through the Han Dynasty; hemp seed oil in ancient China; ancient evidence for traditional production and use beyond China (Korea, Japan, South and Southwest Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, Mediterranean and Western European Regions); Present-day hemp seed production and use.

Nonpsychoactive Ritual Uses of Cannabis: Hempen rituals of major religions; shamanic influences; archeological remains; Hmong (spirit travel); China (shamanism, Taoism, Confucianism); Korea; Japan; Europe and the Middle East (Judeo-Christian hemp rituals); Hangings: hemp cordage and hempen executions.

Cannabis and Homo sapiens: The long-term relationship; Cannabis’s evolution; Cannabis’s influence on the evolution of human culture; A case for the social benefits of Cannabis’s psychoactivity; Human influence on Cannabis’s evolution; Environmental impact of the human-Cannabis relationship; Coevolution of Cannabis and Humans: fresh concepts; Present position of the human-Cannabis relationship; Remaining questions and future directions.
