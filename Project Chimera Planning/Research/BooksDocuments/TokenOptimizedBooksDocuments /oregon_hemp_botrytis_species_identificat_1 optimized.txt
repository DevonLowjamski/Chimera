oregon_hemp_botrytis_species_identificat_1.txt

Oregon hemp (Cannabis sativa) 2019: Polk & Linn counties.  Dieback, necrosis, yield reduction (up to 90% plant infection). Inflorescence tops most affected; no foliar lesions. Gray/white mycelium, Botrytis-like conidiophores observed. 23 isolates from 3 fields.  White/gray, fast-growing mycelium; conidiophores, Botryose conidia clusters, black sclerotia.  G3PDH gene sequencing (GenBank MN909293-MN909315): 20 isolates >99-100% identical to B. cinerea (B05.10, JQ036050); 2 isolates >99% identical to B. pseudocinerea (10091, JN692414); 1 isolate >99% identical to unnamed Botrytis sp. (KY200370).  Pathogenicity trials: Isolates LV05 (B. cinerea), LV20 (B. pseudocinerea), LV07 (Botrytis sp.) on receptive female inflorescences. 20Â°C, dark, high humidity (3 days). 8 replicates/species. Necrosis/decay, epiphytic mycelium. Symptoms consistent with field observations and literature (McPartland 1996).  Fungus reisolated from all inoculated plants; not from controls. First Koch's postulates completion for B. cinerea on Oregon hemp. First report of B. pseudocinerea and novel Botrytis sp. on C. sativa.  Further sampling expected to reveal additional Botrytis species. References: Garfinkel et al. 2019 (Sci. Rep. 9: 6671); McPartland 1996 (J. Int. Hemp Plant Assoc. 3:19); Staats et al. 2005 (Mol.
