**1. Cannabis Genus & History:**

* Origin: Central Asia, north of Himalayas. Spread due to human intervention.
* Uses: Food (seeds, oil), textiles/rope (stem fibers), medicine/intoxication (flowering heads, leaves).
* Ancient China (3rd millennium BC): Medicinal uses (rheumatism, gynecological disorders, malaria); Hua Tu (115–205 AD) used as anesthetic. Oldest hemp cloth: ~1200 BC. Used as currency (9–23 AD).
* Ancient Egypt (16th century BC): Ebers papyrus mentions medicinal & fiber uses; mummy hair shows high cannabis levels (~1070 BC).
* Bible/Judea: Possible indirect references (Ezekiel's "pannag"); speculation re: Saul's madness, Ezekiel's visions. Remains found near Jerusalem (~4th century AD).
* Prehistoric Europe/Scythia: Hemp seeds (Neolithic); "polypod" bowls (~3rd millennium BC); Herodotus (5th century BC) describes Scythian cannabis burning ritual.
* Ancient Greece/Rome: Primarily fiber use; limited medicinal mentions; lack of intoxication descriptions. Speculation about "nepenthe" in Odyssey.
* Persia/Arabia: "Hashish" (dried herb of pleasure); medicinal & intoxicating uses; social stigma documented; diverse preparations (e.g., bhang, charas, sabzi). Marco Polo's "Old Man of the Mountain" legend.
* India: Atharva Veda (~2000 BC); Susruta (~1000 BC); medicinal and intoxicating uses documented; Aurangzeb's failed prohibition (1659); detailed cultivation/processing methods; various preparations (e.g., bhang, ganja, charas).  Used to enhance endurance.
* South America: Peruvian mummies (~200–1500 AD) show cannabinoids; suggests pre-Columbian contact.
* Europe (post-500 AD): Medicinal use (Hildegard of Bingen, Peter Schoeffer); association with witchcraft; Eastern European folklore.
* England (pre-1800): Hemp cultivation for fiber; Anglo-Saxon herbal mentions; Shakespeare references hemp for rope; 17th-century herbals describe medicinal uses; medicinal use questioned in later texts.  Intoxicating effects noted.
* France (19th century): Moreau de Tours' research on mental illness treatment; Le Club des Haschischins; literary figures’ experiences.
* Victorian Britain: Medicinal uses documented; recreational use emerges; debate on effects.
* North America: Hemp cultivation for fiber; recreational use emerges; anti-cannabis campaigns (1930s); Marihuana Tax Act (1937).


**2. Cannabis Plant: Botany, Cultivation, Processing:**

* Products: Hemp fiber (textiles, rope), seeds (food, oil), medicinal/narcotic preparations.
* Geographical origin: Central Asia, north of Afghanistan.
* Taxonomy: *Cannabis sativa* L.; debate on mono- vs. polytypic genus; subspecies (sativa, indica); varieties (cultivated, spontaneous).
* Botanical features: Dioecious (male/female plants); monoecious plants exist; morphology (leaves, stems, roots, flowers, trichomes). Five trichome types; cannabinoids in glandular trichomes. Fast Blue B stain for cannabinoids.
* Growth cycle: Annual; germination (3–7 days); flowering (photoperiod-dependent); maturation (2–10 months); early vs. late maturing ecotypes; few natural enemies.
* Cultivation history: Ancient uses for fiber, medicine, intoxication; spread globally; hemp cultivation in Europe, North America; narcotic use in Asia, South America.
* Present-day cultivation: Legal hemp (low THC, high CBD) vs. illicit drug-type cannabis (high THC); cultivation sites; indoor/greenhouse cultivation.
* Illicit cannabis products: Marijuana, hashish, hash oil; diverse names across regions; sinsemilla (seedless female buds); cultivation methods (e.g., removal of male plants for sinsemilla); processing methods (e.g., bhang, ganja, charas). International trafficking patterns. THC content varies widely across products & origins. THC stability influenced by light, air, heat; degradation to CBN.


**3. Cannabis Chemistry:**

* Over 400 compounds; cannabinoids (unique to *Cannabis sativa*).
* Cannabinoid numbering systems: dibenzopyran, monoterpenoid.
* Cannabinoid structural types: CBG, CBC, CBD, THC, CBN, etc. Acid analogues, methyl ethers, side chain variations.  Two chiral centers.
* Cannabinoid biogenesis: Olivetolic acid/olivetol + geranyl pyrophosphate; CBGA, CBDA, THCA; potential for multiple THC isomers.  Proposed biogenetic pathways.  Phloroglucinol possible role.
* Non-cannabinoid constituents: Alkaloids, sugars, fatty acids, amino acids, proteins, terpenes, phenols, flavonoids, etc. Unusual constituents (amides, spiro-indans, dihydrostilbenes).
* Chemical variation: Chemotypes (drug-type, fiber-type, intermediate); influence of genetics and environment; classification systems based on cannabinoid ratios and concentrations; interplant variability; analytical methods (HPLC, GC-MS) used for chemotype identification and source tracing.


**4. Analytical & Legislative Aspects:**

* Legal definitions: International conventions (1925, 1931, 1961); national enactments (UK Dangerous Drugs Acts, Misuse of Drugs Act 1971); evolving definitions of cannabis; removal from pharmacopoeias.  France's legal provisions regarding hemp cultivation.
* Forensic analysis: Techniques for identifying cannabis and determining cannabinoid content.
