Plant Life Cycle: Seedling (1-3 weeks, vulnerable, 2 embryonic leaves, unique second leaves, root growth); Vegetative (1-2 months, rapid growth, 68-77°F, 50-70% humidity, 18 hrs light, fertilizer); Flowering (6-10 weeks, bud production, separate male/female plants, 68-77°F, 50% humidity, 12 hrs light, phosphorus/potassium nutrients).  Hermaphrodites self-pollinate, reducing THC. Sinsemilla: seedless female plants with high THC.

Cannabis Strains: Sativa (tall, narrow leaves, long flowering cycle, warm climates), Indica (short, broad leaves, short flowering cycle, cold climates).  Indica/Sativa classification unreliable for predicting effects; cannabinoid/terpene profiles more informative.  THC: psychoactive, CBD: non-psychoactive. Examples: Skunk #1 (hybrid, 29.2% THC), Strawberry Guava (hybrid), Green Crack (Sativa-dominant), Papaya Punch (Indica), Bruce Banner (high THC), Bubble Gum, White Widow (balanced hybrid), Sunset Sherbet (Indica-leaning), Blueberry (Indica), AK-47 (Sativa-dominant), Bubba Kush (Indica), Sour Diesel (Sativa-dominant).

Seed Germination: Requires air, heat (70-90°F), water. Methods: Paper towel (keep moist, avoid overwatering), Soaking (overnight, plant promptly).  Micropyles crucial for water absorption.

Planting: Indoor (controlled environment, requires resources), Outdoor (cheaper, less control, weather/pest challenges). Growing mediums: Soil (organic, well-draining), Soilless (coco coir, vermiculite, etc., requires nutrient supplementation), Hydroponic (high yields, expensive).  Optimal temp: 80.6°F.  Nutrient burn possible with overfeeding seedlings.  Use seedling soil initially.

Vegetative Growth: Focus on strong roots, stems, foliage.  Nitrogen-rich fertilizer.  Monitor light (avoid burning), temperature (68-78°F), humidity (50-70%), airflow.  Electrical conductance: 1.0 initially, increasing to 1.5 then 2.0.  Overwatering causes excessive stem growth.  18-24 hours light daily.  Transplant when roots emerge from bottom.  Problems: pests, stretching (lack of light), slow growth, mold, bad odor, leaf loss, discoloration.

Cloning: Asexual reproduction, creates genetically identical plants.  Select healthy, mature (2+ months) female plants (vegetative stage).  Cuttings: 6-8 inches, 2 nodes, 45-degree angle cut below node.  Rooting hormone, rooting medium (rockwool, cubes), humidity (65%+).  Viral infections possible, especially with older mother plants. Transplant after 10-14 days (1-2 inch roots). 12 hours light daily.

Flowering: 12/12 light cycle (photoperiod seeds), genetics determine onset (autoflowering). Stages: Weeks 1-3 (growth spurt, switch to bloom nutrients); Weeks 3-4 (budlets form, monitor for problems); Weeks 4-6 (bud fattening, minimal training); Weeks 6-8 (bud ripening, avoid excess nitrogen, monitor for fox tailing); Week 8+ (bud maturation, pistils turn orange/brown, trichomes change from clear to milky to amber, flush with pH-balanced water).

Harvesting:  Trichomes (clear: wait, milky: optimal, amber: past peak). Pistils (white: early, 70-90% brown: optimal, 100% brown: past peak). Flowering time: Indica (8 weeks), Sativa (10-12 weeks), Autoflowering (10 weeks).  Harvest on dry day (outdoors).   Tools: gloves, isopropyl alcohol, shears.  Hang upside down in dark room (64°F, 45% humidity), 10-14 days drying.

Drying & Curing: Drying (5-15 days, crunchy texture, 60-70°F, 45-55% humidity), Curing (2-3 weeks+, airtight container, 60-70°F, 45-55% humidity).  Purpose: increase potency, improve flavor, preserve marijuana.  Monitor for mold and ammonia odor.

Indoor Growing:  Grow space (light-tight, clean, easy to sanitize), air circulation (exhaust fan, filtered air inlet, 70-85°F lights on, 58-70°F lights off), monitors/controllers (timers, thermostat switches), containers (well-draining).  Lighting: HID (MH for vegetative, HPS for flowering, needs cooling hood), Fluorescent (inexpensive, less efficient), LED (expensive, energy-efficient, less heat), Induction (efficient, longer lifespan).  Growing mediums: hydroponics (soilless), soil (organic super soil).

Indoor Water & Nutrients: Filtered water, avoid overwatering, pH (6-7 soil, 5.5-6.5 hydroponics).  Macronutrients (N, P, K), micronutrients.  Two-part nutrient solutions (separate vegetative/flowering), Cal/Mag supplement. Start with half-strength solution, monitor for nutrient burn.

Outdoor Growing: Climate considerations (temperature, wind, rain), growing space (sun exposure, wind protection, security/privacy). Genetics: seeds (hardy, but phenotype variation), clones (consistent, may be less sturdy), auto-flowering (fast growing, sometimes less potent). Soil: amend clay soils (drainage, aeration, nutrients), sandy soils (water retention). Fertilizers: organic (slow release, less risk of runoff), commercial (faster release). Containers:  consider heat conduction. Watering: deep watering (morning), adjust frequency based on weather and soil type. Improve drainage to avoid waterlogging.

Outdoor Pests & Weather: Heat stress (taco-shaped leaves, water, shade), frost/hail (cover plants), pests (companion planting, soil sterilization, beneficial insects, diatomaceous earth, neem oil, sticky pads, netting, fences).

Breeding:  Select parent strains (female traits more prominent). Breeding chamber (contain pollen).  Pollen collection & storage (airtight, freezer/refrigerator). Selective pollination (paintbrush, bag individual colas).  Phenotypes (expressions of genes), backcrossing (increase homozygosity, strengthen desirable traits). Simple propagation technique for home growers.
