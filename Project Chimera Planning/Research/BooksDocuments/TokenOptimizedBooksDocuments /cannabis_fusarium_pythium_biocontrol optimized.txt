**Objective:** Evaluate efficacy of five biocontrol agents against *Fusarium oxysporum* (damping-off) and *Pythium myriotylum* (root/crown rot) in cannabis.

**Pathogens:** *F. oxysporum*, *F. solani*, *F. proliferatum*, *P. myriotylum*, *P. dissotocum*, *P. aphanidermatum*.  *F. oxysporum* causes stunting, chlorosis, wilting, root/crown rot, damping-off. *Pythium* spp. cause root/crown rot, stunting, chlorosis, wilting.

**Biocontrol Agents:**
* Rhapsody® ASO (*Bacillus subtilis*): Tested against *F. oxysporum* only. 15 mL/L drench.
* Stargus® (*Bacillus amyloliquefaciens*): 15 mL/L drench.
* Lalstop® (*Gliocladium catenulatum*): 5 g/L drench.
* RootShield® Plus WP (*Trichoderma harzianum*, *T. virens*): 0.45 g/L drench.
* Asperello® (*Trichoderma asperellum*): 1 g/L drench.

**Fusarium Experiment:**
* Cannabis strain: ‘White Rhino’.
* Application: Biocontrol agents applied to cuttings in rockwool blocks 48 hr before 7.8 x 10⁷ cfu/mL *F. oxysporum* inoculation.
* Assessment: Disease severity (0-4 scale) at 7, 14, 21 days post-inoculation (DPI). AUDPC calculated.
* Results: Lalstop, RootShield, Asperello, Stargus significantly reduced (30-56.3%) disease severity at 14 DPI (P<0.05).  RootShield, Asperello, Lalstop showed endophytic colonization at 2 & 7 DPI.

**Pythium Experiment (2 experiments):**
* Cannabis strains: ‘Island Honey’ (Exp 1), ‘White Rhino’ (Exp 2).
* Application: Biocontrol agents (25 mL Exp 1, 50 mL Exp 2) applied as drench 7 days before *P. myriotylum* inoculation (Stargus 2d in Exp 1). Inoculum: 3.25 x 10³ cfu/mL (Exp 1), 1.34 x 10³ cfu/mL (Exp 2). Root wounding before inoculation.
* Assessment: Disease severity (0-5 scale) at 7, 14, 18 (Exp 1), 21 (Exp 2) DPI. Plant height, shoot/root weight, root length measured. AUDPC calculated.
* Results (Exp 1): Lalstop significantly reduced disease severity at 18 DPI (P<0.001); increased root weight (P<0.05).  (Exp 2): Lalstop, RootShield, Asperello, Stargus significantly reduced disease severity at all time points (P<0.05). RootShield significantly increased root weight (P=0.01).

**Endophytic Colonization:**
* Cannabis strains: ‘Moby Dick’, ‘White Rhino’.
* Application: Biocontrol agents (RootShield, Asperello, Lalstop) applied to cuttings in rockwool blocks.
* Assessment: Endophytic colonization (0-5, 5-10, 10-15 cm segments) at 2 and 7 DPI.
* Results: Significant colonization (P ≤ 0.001) in 0-5 cm segments for all agents at both time points.  RootShield showed significant (P=0.003) colonization in 5-10 cm segment in 'White Rhino' at 7 DPI.

**Statistical Analysis:** Kruskal-Wallis with Conover-Iman post-hoc and Holm correction for disease severity; ANOVA with Tukey's HSD post-hoc for plant growth and endophyte colonization.  All experiments used randomized block design.

**Conclusion:** Lalstop and RootShield most effective against both pathogens. Endophytic colonization contributes to biocontrol. Further research needed on larger scale, longer durations, application timing and rates.
