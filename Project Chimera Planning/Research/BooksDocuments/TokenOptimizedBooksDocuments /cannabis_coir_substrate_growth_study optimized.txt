**Objective:** Evaluate coir-based substrates for cannabis vegetative and flowering stages.

**Trials:** Two trials in walk-in growth chambers.

**Trial 1 (Vegetative):**
* Cannabis sativa L. ‘OG Kush × Grizzly’ (17-day-old cuttings).
* Substrates:
    * ABcann UNIMIX 1 – HP (U1-HP): Lower container capacity (CC), better drainage.
    * ABcann UNIMIX 1 (U1): Higher CC.
    * PRO-MIX MP ORGANIK MYCORRHIZAE (PM-V): Peat-based control.
* 21-day vegetative period, 22°C, 85% RH, 500 ppm CO2, 250±50 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ PAR (18h photoperiod).
* Fertigation: Liquid organic fertilizer (4.0N-1.3P-1.7K; 234 mg N L⁻¹), ≈30% substrate moisture.
* Transplant to flowering chamber (same substrate for all): 12h photoperiod, 500±50 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹.
* Flowering fertilizer: Nutri Plus Organic Bloom (2.00N-0.87P-3.32K), variable N rates (77-129 mg N L⁻¹).
* Flush (RO water): 10 L pot⁻¹ (7 days pre-harvest), 6 L pot⁻¹ (5 days pre-harvest).
* Harvest (47 days flowering): 11±1% moisture, cured 14 days at 18°C, 60% RH.
* Results: No growth/yield differences between substrates; PMV had higher branch number.  U1-HP (lower CC) and U1 (higher CC) showed similar growth, suggesting tolerance to varying moisture content during vegetative stage.  Substrate EC consistent across treatments, lower in PMV at 22 DAT; pH higher in coir-based substrates (6.3-6.9) than PMV (5.5-6.1). Estimated suitable vegetative pH range: 5.5-6.9.

**Trial 2 (Flowering):**
* Cannabis sativa L. ‘WP:Med (Wappa)’ (15-day-old cuttings).
* Vegetative period (19 days): 24°C, 76% RH, 553 ppm CO2, 250±50 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ PAR (18h photoperiod).
* Fertigation: Nutri Plus Grow (389 mg N L⁻¹), calcium-magnesium supplement (1 mL L⁻¹), ≈30% substrate moisture.
* Transplant to flowering chamber (53-day flowering period).
* Substrates:
    * ABcann UNIMIX 2 – HP (U2-HP): Lower CC, better drainage.
    * ABcann UNIMIX 2 (U2): Higher CC.
* 6-L pots, coir weed control disks.
* Variable temperature (22-18°C), RH (70-43%), CO2 (553-781 ppm) during flowering.
* 580±93 µmol m⁻² s⁻¹ PAR (12h photoperiod).
* Fertigation: Nutri Plus Bloom (113 mg N L⁻¹), calcium-magnesium & Organa ADD micronutrients, ≈30% substrate moisture; pH 5.5-6.3.
* Flush (RO water): ≈30% substrate moisture content.
* Harvest (53 days): ≈50% amber resin, mechanical trimming (Twister T4).
* Drying: 6 days (18°C, 49% RH), curing: 11 days (18°C, 58% RH).
* Results: No growth difference between U2-HP and U2; U2-HP had 29% higher yield. U2-HP (lower CC) favored for higher root zone oxygen and yield. Estimated suitable flowering pH range: 5.5-7.3.

**Trial 1 Results (Table 3):** See original document for detailed table.

**Trial 2 Results (Table 4):** See original document for detailed table.

**Figure 1:**  See original document for graph showing substrate pH and EC over time for both trials.

**Conclusion:** Coir-based substrates (U1-HP or U1) effective for vegetative stage; U1-HP minimizes root pathogens, U1 reduces fertigation frequency. U2-HP preferred for flowering stage due to higher yield and root zone oxygen.
