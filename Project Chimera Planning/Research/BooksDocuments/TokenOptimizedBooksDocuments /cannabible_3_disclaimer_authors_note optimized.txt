Foreword (DJ Short & Lee Stanley Danielski):

DJ Short defines "good herb": enjoyment, well-being, creative stimulation, deeper insights, counters competitive urges, facilitates experiencing Buddha nature & feminine mystique; potency less important than quality of effect; examples: Highland Gold Oaxacan, Colombian (Santa Marta), Guerrero Green, Acapulco Gold, Hawaiian, Maui Wowie, Kona Gold, Thai; prefers subtle, lasting effects; multijar test: best herb runs out first.

Lee Stanley Danielski on Cannabis & Community: Cooperation vs. control; freedom & independence; cannabis community's success despite persecution; stereoscopic view of reality (baseline vs. altered state); cannabis aids independent thought; economic value (sometimes exceeding gold); contributions to cooperative community; persecution of activists (Rene Boje, Tommy Chong, Marc Emery, et al.); cannabis potential: food, fuel, textiles, medicine; dependence on corporate elite, fossil fuels, pharmaceuticals, overindulgence, monoculture; politics & religion as forms of control; feminine oppression; tactics: personal responsibility, avoiding blame, definitive language; Golden Rule with Platinum Clause (enjoy life, not at expense of another); R.I.S.S-S. (Responsible Independent Sustainable Self-Sufficiency); bioregionalism; advice: drop out, tune in, turn on (Leary); stay in your own movie (Kesey); keep cool; government reform (community & global levels); cannabis as a tool for evolution, consciousness expansion.

Introduction: Goal: improve global cannabis quality via education; positive feedback from readers; initial challenges gaining grower trust; difficulty cataloging strains (grower skill & phenotype variation); growing strains personally impractical; utilizes online cannabis community (overgrow.com, cannabisworld.com); works with master cultivators; evaluates multiple phenotypes; honest reviews, even of disliked strains; alternative everything:  toxic food supply, contaminated water, harmful building materials, pharmaceuticals, body care products; promotes organic food, growing own food, lower food chain; solar power, biodiesel, natural fibers;  vibration raising/lowering activities (extensive lists provided in original); recommends Woody Harrelson's "How to Go Further."  overgrow.com & cannabisworld.com websites down (Heaven's Stairway seed company bust).
