**Study Objective:** Quantify temperature's effect on cannabinoid degradation in dried cannabis flower.

**Methodology:**

* **Materials:**  Cannabis sativa blend (THCA/THC & CBDA/CBD strains).  Two-stage blending, 355-μm sieving, hand-mixing.  NRC certified reference material (CRM) used.
* **Cannabinoids Monitored (14):** THC, THCA, CBD, CBDA, CBG, CBGA, CBN, CBNA, CBC, CBCA, THCV, THCVA, CBDV, CBDVA (Table 1 provides certified mass fraction values and uncertainties).
* **Analysis:** Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  Isotopic internal standards (THC-d3, CBD-d3, CBN-d3). External calibration standards (3 levels).  R² ≥ 0.99; combined relative measurement uncertainty ~2%.
* **Stability Study:** Accelerated isochronous study.  Storage temperatures: -20°C, +4°C, +20°C, +32°C, +37°C, +40°C, and -80°C (control). Duration: up to 52 weeks (additional data for +30°C, +40°C). Samples weighed before and after storage.
* **Homogeneity Assessment:**  Measurements of 14 cannabinoids from 10 CRM units. Homogeneity uncertainty averaged 2% (1-4% range).


**Kinetic Modeling:**

* **Reaction System:** Network of first-order degradation reactions.  Idealized consecutive pseudo first-order reaction system (Eq. 1): A → N → Y (A = carboxylic acid form, N = decarboxylated analogue, Y = unknown degradation product).  Examples: THCA → THC;  Considered THC → CBN.  Disregarded minor reactions (CBD → THC, CBGA → CBDA/THCA, CBC → CBL).
* **Temperature Effect:** Arrhenius equation (Eq. 3): ln k(T) = a + b/T.
* **Model Fitting:** Bayesian multi-curve fitting using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. STAN software used. Diffuse priors with common-sense boundaries. Numerical integration methods.  Initial parameter values from pre-fitting using "mkin" R package. Computational codes provided in supplementary information.


**Results:**

* **Model Fit:** Simple first-order kinetic model explains observed cannabinoid changes.  CBN treated as stable product (kCBN = 0).  Decarboxylation rate constants (kA) largely indistinguishable for all seven cannabinoids analyzed.
* **Temperature Dependence:** 85% shelf-life doubles with each 5°C temperature reduction.  THCA+THC degradation at 20°C: ~2% per month.
* **Cannabis Age Estimation:**  Model age calculated from acid:decarboxylated cannabinoid ratios (Eq. 6, 7).  Example:  Model age from RCBNA:THCA ≈ 57 weeks at 22°C.  Discrepancy noted between different ratio-based age estimates.
* **CBN:THC Ratio:** Linear relationship observed between storage duration and CBN:THC ratio at room temperature (t ≈ 30 RCBN:THC years).


**Comparison with Literature:**

* Decarboxylation rate constants generally agree with previous studies at higher temperatures (Fig. 7), but many studies lack distinction between acid and decarboxylated forms.


**Conclusion:**

First-order kinetic model accurately describes cannabinoid degradation at near-room temperatures.  Applicability to shelf-life estimation and cannabis age calculation.  High sample homogeneity crucial for applying model to typical samples.  Potential for differences in cannabinoid stability across strains.
