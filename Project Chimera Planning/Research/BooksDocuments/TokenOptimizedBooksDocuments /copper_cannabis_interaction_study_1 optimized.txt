**Study Objective:** Investigate copper's effect on cannabis's neuropharmacological actions in rats and mice.

**Methods:**
* Cannabis resin (17% THC) administered orally (50mg/kg).
* Copper sulfate (CuSO4): 5mg/kg oral, 0.1µg intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.).
* Zinc sulfate (ZnSO4): 5mg/kg oral.
* Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4): 5mg/kg i.p.
* Pentobarbital-induced hypnosis (rats: 25mg/kg i.p.; mice: 40mg/kg i.p.) measured via righting reflex.
* Hypothermia measured via rectal temperature (Telethermometer).
* Tolerance studies involved daily cannabis administration (7-28 days).
* Penicillamine (100mg/kg i.p.) used as copper chelator.

**Results:**

* **Copper alone:** No neuropharmacological effects.
* **Copper + Cannabis (non-tolerant):**
    * Potentiated pentobarbital hypnosis potentiation (rats, 20mg/kg cannabis, significant).
    * No significant effect on hypothermia.
* **Copper + Cannabis (tolerant):**
    * Partially inhibited barbiturate hypnosis potentiation tolerance.
    * Significantly delayed/inhibited hypothermia tolerance (oral and i.c.v. copper). Single oral dose delayed tolerance; subsequent single dose reversed tolerance. I.c.v. copper prolonged hypothermia effect.
* **Penicillamine + Cannabis:** No significant effect on hypothermia.
* **Penicillamine + i.c.v. Copper + THC:** Antagonized copper's hypothermia-inducing effect.
* **Zinc + Cannabis:** Similar to copper in delaying/inhibiting hypothermia tolerance, but less potent and shorter duration.
* **Magnesium + Cannabis:** No effect on hypothermia tolerance; slightly increased hyperthermia.

**Conclusions:**

* Copper interacts with cannabis, particularly in tolerant animals, affecting hypothermia.
* Site of action: likely hypothalamus, affecting noradrenergic neurons and tolerance development.
* Copper's action resembles zinc's, not magnesium's.
* Interaction not due to physicochemical complex formation; effect prolonged.
* Penicillamine antagonizes copper's effect.  Free copper, not bound copper, is likely responsible.
* Possible mechanism: restoration of dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) activity through copper binding to DBH inhibitors in tolerant rats.
