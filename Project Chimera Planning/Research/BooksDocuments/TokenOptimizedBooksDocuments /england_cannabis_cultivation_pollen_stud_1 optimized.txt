Old Buckenham Mere pollen data (5000 years):  Neolithic impact minimal; Late Bronze/Iron Age: forest clearance for pasture; Anglo-Saxon: arable expansion on heavier soils; Secale (rye) cultivation from Roman period; continuous Cannabis sativa (hemp) pollen curve from Early Anglo-Saxon; high Cannabis cultivation in Late Saxon/Norman periods (legally enforced in Tudor times).

Cannabis pollen identification:  Pore rim void (Cannabis), steep tectum rise above pore (Cannabis), steep external pore slope (Cannabis). Old Buckenham Mere pollen closely matches Cannabis, not Humulus lupulus.

Old Buckenham Mere chronology: Secale curve start ≈ 0 BC (400cm depth); average deposition rate ≈ 1000 years/meter; Neolithic clearances ≈ 3033 BC.

Old Buckenham Mere anthropogenic influences: Neolithic: slight; Bronze Age: moderate forest clearance (pasture); Iron Age: extensive clearance (pasturage); Anglo-Saxon: widespread arable cultivation (Secale, Linum, Cannabis); Late Saxon/Norman: maximal Cannabis, arable cultivation; 14th century: decline in activity.

Archaeological context (Clarke, 1960): Bronze Age: nomadic pastoralists; Iron Age: peasant farmers (sheep, oxen, cereals, Celtic fields); Roman: slow Romanization, continued pastoralism; Anglo-Saxon: multiple ox-teams, heavier soil cultivation, dense population (East Anglia); Norman: feudal control, continued rural economy.  Quercus decline post-800 AD attributed to building needs; 14th century decline attributed to Black Death, marginal land abandonment, Kett's Rebellion.

European pollen evidence: Switzerland (Welten, 1952): Cannabis pollen 10-13%, 1100-1600 AD; Norway (Hafsten, 1956): 45% non-arboreal pollen, 0-500 AD; Sweden (Fries, 1958, 1962): 10%+ total tree pollen, 850-1200 AD; Denmark (Anderson, 1954): 1600 AD maximum; Germany (Wiermann, 1965): intermittent 500 BC, continuous 400 AD, high 1400 AD; France (Corillion & Planchais, 1963, van Zeist, 1964): 11th-18th centuries.

British pollen evidence: Westmorland (Walker, 1955, Oldfield, 1963, Oldfield & Statham, 1963): Romano-British, 1550-1800 AD; Lancashire (Birks, 1964): 900-1500 AD; Cheshire (Birks, 1965): Romano-British, Tudor; Dartmoor (Simmonds, 1964): insufficient evidence.
