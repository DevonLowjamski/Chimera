**Objective:** Mid-IR spectroscopy for THC & CBD quantification in Cannabis flowers & extracts.

**Methods:**

* **Samples:**  Untreated air-dried Cannabis flowers (FL1: high THCA, low CBDA; FL2: high CBDA, low THCA), decarboxylated flowers (FLT), Cannabis extracts (Ex).
* **Reference Method:** HPLC (UNODC method for FLT & Ex; Shimadzu Nexera for FL1 & FL2).
* **Spectroscopy:** Bruker Alpha Platinum ATR-FTIR (4000–400 cm⁻¹, 8 scans, 4 cm⁻¹ resolution).
* **Chemometrics:** Partial Least Squares (PLS) using 2nd derivative of 1800–400 cm⁻¹ spectral region; Savitzky-Golay smoothing.  Statistical indicators: R²Y, R²X, Q², RMSEE, RMSEcv, RMSEP, VIP plots, coefficient plots.


**Results:**

* **HPLC:** FL1: 18.42% total THC, <0.2% total CBD; FL2: 20.33% total CBD, 0.79% total THC.
* **FTIR:** Distinctive spectral features identified for THC(A) and CBD(A). Decarboxylation identified by intensity changes at 1510, 1430, 1260, 1180, 1040, 835 cm⁻¹ (increase) and 888, 620 cm⁻¹ (decrease).  Specific band assignments detailed in Table 2 & 3.
* **PLS Models (Extracts):**
    * THC: R²Y=0.95, RMSEP=3.79%, VIP>1 at 1040, 1425, 1183, 1577 cm⁻¹.
    * CBD: R²Y=0.99, RMSEP=1.44%, VIP>1 at 1040, 1425, 1183, 1577, 880 cm⁻¹.
* **PLS Models (Flowers):**
    * THC: R²Y=0.99, RMSEP=2.32%, VIP>1 at 1620, 1610, 1578, 1425, 1180, 1038, 1010, 825 cm⁻¹.
    * CBD: R²Y=0.99, RMSEP=1.33%, VIP>1 at 1440, 1185, 1100, 1010, 911, 888, 826 cm⁻¹.

**Conclusion:** ATR-MIR spectroscopy is a promising PAT tool for THC & CBD quantification in Cannabis flowers and extracts. Accuracy influenced by sample complexity, variability, and ATR contact (flowers).
