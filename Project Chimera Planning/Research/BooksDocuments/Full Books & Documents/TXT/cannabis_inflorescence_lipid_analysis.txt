18 Title: The influences of cultivation setting on inflorescence lipid distributions,  19 concentrations, and carbon isotope ratios of Cannabis sp. 
20 
21 Abstract 
22 While much is known about how the growth environment influences many aspects of  23 floral morphology and physiology, little is known about how the growth settings  24 influences floral lipid composition. We explored variations in paraffin wax composition  25 in Cannabis sp., a cash crop grown both indoors and outdoors across the United States  26 today. Given an increased focus on regulation of this crop, there are additional incentives  27 to certify the setting of Cannabis cultivation. To understand the impacts of the growth  28 environment, we studied distributions, concentrations, and carbon isotope ratios of n 29 alkanes isolated from Cannabis sp. inflorescences to assess if variations within these lipid  30 parameters were related to known growth settings of specimens seized by federal agents.  31 We found that Cannabis plants cultivated under open field settings had increased

lower carbon isotope (δ13 35 C) values compared to plants from open-field environments.  36 While this set of observations on seized plant specimens cannot address the particular  37 driver behind these observations, we posit that (a) variations in irradiance and/or  38 photoperiod may influence the distribution and concentration of inflorescence lipids, and  (b) the δ13C value of source CO2 and lipid concentration regulates the δ13 39 C values of  40 inflorescence n-C29 and bulk Cannabis plant materials. Nonetheless, by using a  cultivation model based on δ13 41 C values of n-C29, the model correctly identified the  42 growth environment 90 % of time. We suggest that these lipid markers may be used to  43 trace cultivation methods of Cannabis sp. now and become a more powerful marker in  44 the future, once the mechanism(s) behind these patterns is uncovered.  45

Accepted Manuscript 51 
52 The policies surrounding the use and distribution of marijuana (Cannabis sp.) are  53 controversial within the United States. While possession, cultivation, and sales of  54 marijuana remains illegal under the Federal Controlled Substance Act, the District of  55 Columbia and the States of Washington, Colorado, Oregon, and Alaska have recently  56 legalized marijuana for personal use and additional States have current ballot measures.  57 In response, the Department of Justice released a series of enforcement priorities seeking  58 to avert the public health consequences of marijuana usage; curb trafficking and violence  59 associated with illegal marijuana distribution and sales by criminal enterprises; and limit  60 transport of marijuana between jurisdictions with differing marijuana laws. These District  61 and State jurisdictions are now working to develop regulatory mechanisms for the  62 production and sales of marijuana and other marijuana-derived products; however, given  63 the nascent state of the legislation, there remain numerous ambiguities within these  64 regulations. In particular, within jurisdictions where Cannabis production and sale is  65 legal, the growth environments of Cannabis cultivation are highly regulated by the local  66 government. As an example, the State of Colorado requires the physical locations of  67 Cannabis cultivation—such as individual fields or specific glass/hothouses—as well as  68 the site of production facilities to be certified and all crops and products must be  69 inventoried. Thus, there is a need for product traceability during plant cultivation, harvest,  70 shipment, and following the manufacture of Cannabis products.

72 Stable isotope analysis of marijuana has demonstrated its potential to improve the  
73 forensic and law enforcement communities’ understanding of marijuana production  Accepted Manuscript 
74 methods, growth environments, and trafficking networks [1-3]. In this respect, carbon  (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15 75 N) isotope values have proven moderately useful. In a series of  76 papers, Shibuya and colleagues demonstrated the potential to differentiate three of the  
77 five major production regions of marijuana cultivation in Brazil based on observed  differences in the bulk δ13C and δ15 78 N isotope values of seized marijuana samples [4, 5].  79 West and others followed with a study of eradicated and seized material from the U.S.,  but could not to distinguish region-of-origin based on bulk δ13C and δ15 80 N values alone [6].  81 While cultivation location could not be assigned in this dataset, the growth environment  could be identified using δ13 82 C values as plants grown outdoors had unique values  83 compared to plants grown in a greenhouse system [6].  
84 
In plants, stable carbon isotope (δ13C) values reflect the additive influences of the δ13 85 C  86 value of atmospheric CO2 and isotopic fractionations associated with diffusion and  87 carbon fixation [7, 8]. These fractionation events depend on the ratio of the  88 concentrations of atmospheric CO2 inside (ci) and outside (ca) of the leaf. Given that the  δ13 89 C value of atmospheric CO2 and plant fractionation factors are relatively fixed, ci/ca is  90 responsible for the majority of isotopic variability for a given species living in natural and  managed environments [7, 8]. Factors influencing a plant’s δ13 91 C value through variation  92 in ci/ca are broadly related to plant-water relations and irradiance [7]. The ci/ca is  93 responsive to changes in the stomatal conductance, with important influences on  94 conductance being ambient water vapor deficit, soil moisture, and leaf temperature [9-

95 17]. Both field and laboratory studies have provided extensive evidence for the impact of  
plant-water relations and irradiance on δ13 96 C values in a variety of plant tissues [18-22].  Accepted Manuscript 
97 However, there may be cases where bulk plant tissues are not available, particularly with  98 drug compounds derived from plants, and there have been very few experiments carried  99 out under semi-controlled conditions to understand how these processes effect the  
distributions of and δ13 100 C values of specific plant molecules [23-25].  101 
102 Analysis of non-refractory Cannabis sp. compounds, particularly the cannabinoids and  103 other terpenoids, has been an area of significant scientific research [26-28]. The  104 distribution of cannabinoids have been used to discriminate between Cannabis strains  105 and geographic origin of marijuana strains [29, 30]. Recently, compound-specific isotope  106 analysis (CSIA) of the carbon isotope values of cannabinol (CBN), cannabidiol (CBD)  107 and THC has been demonstrated as feasible [31]. However, it has been well documented  108 that the distribution of cannabinoids can vary markedly within a single plant, through a  109 plant’s life cycle, as plant material ages, and within a single seizure collection [32-35].  110 These variations complicate the standardized usage of cannabinoid distributions and  111 isotope ratios of these compounds as regulatory tools and illustrate the need for the  112 development of a method using refractory, unchanging compounds to monitor and source  113 Cannabis compounds. 
114 
115 High molecular weight straight chain alkanes (n-alkanes) are ubiquitous in higher plants  116 including Cannabis sp. [36]. Furthermore, n-alkanes are highly refractory and are not  117 altered by isotopic exchange at normal surface temperatures and pressures [37]. These 
5

118 characteristics make n-alkanes a possible tool for the regulation and certification of  119 Cannabis-derived products.

121 Here, we present chain-length distributions, concentrations, and stable carbon isotope  122 compositions of n-alkanes extracted from Cannabis inflorescences seized by the U.S.  123 Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) from clandestine growing operations employing either  124 enclosed, greenhouse systems or open field farming methods. This experimental design  125 allows us to investigate the impacts of cultivation method on plant waxes and we  126 hypothesized that cultivation method is recorded in Cannabis n-C29 carbon isotope ratios,  127 similar to the information recorded by bulk Cannabis materials [6, 38]. To test this  128 hypothesis, we analyzed 84 Cannabis inflorescences of U.S. origin from known  129 cultivation settings (i.e., enclosed system vs. open field environments) and explored the  association between growth settings and the distributions, concentrations, and δ13 130 C values  131 of n-C29.

133 2. Methods 
134 2.1. Sample localities and materials collected 
135 We analyzed inflorescences from 84 fully mature domestic marijuana samples of known  136 origin from 53 counties within 18 states (Table 1). Samples analyzed here are a subset of  137 materials used in studies by West et al. [6, 39] and Hurley et al. [38, 40]. In this study on  
138 compound specific isotope analyses, samples were selected from 9 states where  139 possession and usage of marijuana is illegal (AR, FL, IN, KY, MO, TN, TX, WI, and  140 WV) and from 9 additional states with various state-level statutes ranging from legal

143 in some cases roots and seeds were collected between 2003 and 2006 through the U.S.  144 Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) eradication efforts. Notes were provided  145 reporting the growth setting (i.e., enclosed, open field) employed at the clandestine  146 growing operation for all specimens. In addition, information regarding number of plants  147 seized, approximate canopy-cover, and plant height was reported for some, but not all  148 samples. No information regarding the species or specific cultivar of Cannabis was  149 provided. Materials used in this study were collected from archived material that was  150 desiccated and stored in 4-ml glass vials at the University of Utah since initial sample  151 intake. Of the 84 samples, 62 of them were noted by the DEA as having been grown in  152 open field environments and 22 as having been cultivated within enclosed environments.  153 
154 2.2 Lipid extraction, identification, and quantification 
155 Samples (50-400 mg) of inflorescences were isolated and pulverized with a mortar and  156 pestle, filtering and regrinding residual large particles by passing ground material through  157 a 250-μm stainless steel sieve until all material was ground and homogenized. Lipids  158 were extracted from 100-300 mg of powdered inflorescences with 2:1 dichloromethane  159 (DCM)/methanol by ultra-sonication (30 min × 2). The resulting total lipid extracts were  160 concentrated under a stream of purified nitrogen using a FlexiVap Work Station (Glas 161 Col, Terre Haute, IN, USA), transferred to 4-ml glass vials, and further evaporated under  162 a gentle stream of N2 gas. Extracts were then separated into compound classes by column  163 chromatography using 1 g deactivated silica gel (70-230 mesh) in an ashed Pasteur

167 Compounds were identified and their abundances were quantified using a Thermo Ultra  168 gas chromatograph (GC) fitted with a programmable-temperature vaporization (PTV)  169 injector and flame ionization detector. Hydrocarbons were introduced to the PTV injector  170 at 40°C, followed by a 50°C/sec ramp to 320°C. The GC oven temperature program  171 utilized was 60-320°C at 15°C/min with a final isothermal stage lasting 30 min.  172 Compounds were identified through comparison of elution times with n-alkane standards  173 (n-C18, n-C20, n-C22, n-C24, n-C28, and n-C32). Compound concentrations were quantified  174 using a 5-point calibration curve generated from reference materials (n-C24 and n-C28 175 analyzed together at 25 ng, 50 ng, 100 ng, 500 ng, 1000 ng).  
176 
177 2.3. Chain-length Distributions and Concentrations of n-alkanes 178 Peak areas of high molecular weight n-alkanes were measured in order to quantify  179 distributions of n-alkanes. Carbon preference indices (CPI) were calculated following  180 Marzi et al. [42]:  
181 
CPI = (A23 + A25 + A27 + A29 + A31 + A33 )+ (A25 + A27 + A29 + A31 + A33 + A35 )

191 2.4 Compound-specific isotope analysis 
192 Compounds were separated using a Hewlett Packard 6890A GC employing a split 193 splitless injector held at a constant 310°C with an GC oven temperature at 80°C, followed  194 by a 6°C/min ramp to 320°C with an isothermal for 12 min. A fused silica, DB-1, phase  195 column (30 m × 0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 μm film thickness; J&W Scientific, Agilent  196 Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used with helium as the carrier at a flow of 1.2  197 ml/min. Compounds were subsequently combusted over nickel oxide, copper oxide, and  198 platinum at 1000°C and analyzed for carbon isotope ratios using a Thermo Finnigan  Deltaplus 199 XL isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Individual n-C29 isotope ratios were  200 normalized to the VPDB scale using a two-point linear calibration of n-alkane standard  201 reference materials, which had previously been standardized to the VPDB scale [n-C18 (– 202 33.3 ‰) and n-C28 (–29.0 ‰)] and analyzed after every fifth unknown in an analytical  203 sequence. Arndt Schimmelmann’s “Mix A4” [n-C16 (–30.7 ‰), n-C17 (–31.2 ‰), n-C18 204 (–31.1 ‰), n-C19 (–33.2 ‰), n-C20 (–32.4 ‰), n-C21 (–29.1 ‰), n-C22 (–32.9 ‰), n-C23 (– 205 31.8 ‰), n-C24 (–33.3 ‰), n-C25 (–28.5 ‰), n-C26 (–33.0 ‰), n-C27 (–29.6 ‰), n-C28 (– 206 32.2 ‰), n-C29 (–30.1 ‰), and n-C30 (–29.9 ‰)] was analyzed twice in each analytical  207 sequence (n = 32) and had an measured accuracy of 0.1 ‰. Precision for n-alkanes

211 All isotopic compositions are calculated following:  
212 δ = (Rsamp/Rstd)-1 Equation 3, where R represents the 13C/12 213 C abundance ratio, and Rsamp and Rstd represent the sample  214 and standard, respectively. Delta values are reported in per mil (‰) notation and are  215 expressed relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB).  
216 
217 The apparent carbon isotope fractionation between n-C29 and bulk inflorescence (εapp) is  218 defined as: 
εapp = (δ13Cn-C29 + 1)/(δ13 219 CBulk +1)-1, Equation 4. 220 
The carbon isotope value of bulk inflorescence (δ13 221 CBulk) used to determine εapp were  222 previously analyzed and reported in West et al. [6]. Briefly, West and colleague analyzed  δ13CBulk using an elemental analyzer coupled to a Thermo Scientific Deltaplus 223 isotope ratio  224 mass spectrometer and used an offset correction from an known reference material to  225 calibrate the unknown to the VPDB scale. They reported an overall precision of ± 0.09 ‰  for δ13 226 CBulk.

232 was tested with the Shapiro-Wilkes test. If the distributions were normal, then the Welch  233 t-test was used to compare means at α = 0.05. If the distributions were not normally  234 distributed, then the Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis (Rank Sums) test was used to assess  235 differences between growth settings at α = 0.05.  
236 
The measured δ13 237 C values of paired n-alkane and bulk inflorescences were compared  238 using total least squares regressions. Regression lines were fitted to data only when the  239 slope of the line was significantly different from 0 at the α = 0.01 level. 240 
241 3. Results and Discussion 
242 3.1 Compound distributions of n-alkanes on Cannabis inflorescence  243 
Cannabis sp. produced n-C17 to n-C33 with n-C29 (929 ± 680 μg g-1 244 ) being the most  245 abundant homologue, approximately four-times more abundant than the next most  abundant homologue, n-C27 (254 ± 242 μg g-1 246 ) and five-times more abundant than n-C31 (178 ± 134 μg g-1 247 ) (Table 1). We noted large variation in concentrations of n-alkanes  248 between individual specimens (Table 1). These variations are most likely due to  249 differences in Cannabis species or cultivars. Nonetheless, significant differences between  250 the concentrations of n-C29 for the two growth settings—enclosed versus field  251 environments—were detected [Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis, W(91.2) = 3.781, z = −2.925, p 252 = 0.0034], where the plants grown in field environments had a significantly greater 
11 
Page 11 of 37 
concentration of n-C29 (1041 ± 743 μg g-1 253 ) compared to the plants grown in enclosed  
environments (614 ± 290 μg g-1 254 ). Significant differences between the concentrations of  Accepted Manuscript 
255 total n-alkanes for the two growth settings were also detected [Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis,  256 W(82.0) = 3.997, z = −3.098, p = 0.0019]. Here, we found plants grown in field  257 environments had a significantly greater absolute concentrations of n-alkanes (1695 ± 1214 μg g-1 258 ) compared to the plants grown in enclosed environments, under potentially  more controlled conditions (976 ± 432 μg g-1 259 ) (Table 2). 
260 
261 Most research on chain-length distributions and concentrations of n-alkanes has been  262 undertaken on hydrocarbons extracted from leaf material as leaf waxes are thought to be  263 a major contributor to the organic fraction in geologic sediments. A recent meta-analysis  264 of n-alkane concentrations of leaf material from 282 angiosperm species found on  average angiosperms had an absolute n-alkane abundance of 506 ± 497 μg g-1 265 [43]. Here,  266 we found inflorescences of a single angiosperm, Cannabis sp., had nearly triple the  267 absolute amount of n-alkanes compared to angiosperm leaf material. Several studies have  268 noted that inflorescences have greater absolute abundances of n-alkanes compared to  269 leaves on the same plant [44-46]. The reasons behind these differences in concentration  270 of n-alkanes between floral structures and leaves are unresolved. Inflorescence vigor is  271 critical to reproductive success, and thus the increased lipid concentrations may be a  272 response to provide increased protection of these organs. Waxes on leaf cuticle are  273 considered a strategy to guard against water loss and pathogens [36, 47, 48]. Lipids on  274 the inflorescences may also prevent desiccation of floral components, in addition to 
12 
Page 12 of 37 
275 acting as a safeguard against microbial or fungal attack or possibly to stabilize other  276 defensive compounds on the inflorescence.  
Accepted Manuscript 277 
278 In addition, we found Cannabis plants grown under field conditions had nearly double  279 the absolute concentration of n-alkanes on the inflorescences compared to plants grown  280 in enclosed environments (Table 2). Previous research has shown that the concentrations  281 of n-alkanes and other leaf lipids are affected by the plant’s environment (Riederer and  282 Schneider, 1990, Shepard and Griffith, 2006, Bondada et al. 1996). In particular, plants  283 grown in field environments have been shown to produce a greater absolute abundance of  284 n-alkanes than their greenhouse-grown counterparts (Shepard et al., 1995). Increased  285 irradiance and UV-B light has been shown to increase the abundance of n-alkanes in  286 some species (Gonzolez et al., 1996), decrease the amount of n-alkane in other species  287 (Barnes et al., 1996), or cause no change in n-alkane absolute amounts (Baker, 1974).  288 Some of the largest differences in the absolute amount of n-alkanes have been shown in  289 plants grown under water-stressed or polluted condition (Percy et al., 2002; Dixon et al.,  290 1997; Bondada et al., 1996). While the process behind the difference in n-alkane absolute  291 abundance between plants grown in enclosed versus field environments cannot be  292 specifically known in this study, a possible mechanism behind these distribution and  293 concentration patterns may derive from changes in the activity or specificity of particular  294 enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, chain elongation, and decarboxylation  295 processes (Shepard and Griffith, 2006). Although the specific mechanism cannot be  296 isolated in our current study, our data from Cannabis inflorescences grown in different  297 setting are consistent with these models and suggest a common production mechanism

300 We compiled peak areas of all n-alkanes present in the inflorescence of Cannabis sp. to  301 quantify variations in the chain-length distribution of n-alkanes using carbon preference  302 indices (CPI) (Table 1). Strong odd-over-even predominance of n-alkanes is a hallmark  303 of higher plant wax distributions [36, 49, 50] and the distribution of n-alkanes in  
304 Cannabis sp. inflorescences is consistent with these previous observations of leaf waxes  305 (Table 1). We found Cannabis sp. had an average CPI of 13.6 ± 1.9. In addition, we  306 found significant differences between the growth settings [Welch t-test, t(59.9) = 3.662, p 307 = 0.0005], where the plants grown in field environments had a larger CPI (14.0 ± 2.0)  308 compared to the plants grown in enclosed environments (12.6 ± 1.3) (Table 2). The  309 average chain length (ACL) of Cannabis sp. n-alkanes for all growth settings was 28.8 ± 310 0.2. However, significant differences between the growth settings was observed  311 [Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis, W(69.9) = −4.931, z = 4.062, p < 0.0001], where the plants  312 grown in open field environments had a smaller ACL (28.8 ± 0.2) compared to the plants  313 grown in enclosed environments (29.0 ± 0.1) (Table 2). 
314 
315 Here, we observed Cannabis plants grown under field conditions had, on average, greater  316 concentrations of n-alkanes with shorter chain lengths and a more pronounced odd-over 317 even character as compared to plants grown within enclosed systems (Table 2). These  318 differences in n-alkane distributions and concentrations are possibly related to one or  319 several specific growing conditions not quantified in this study. When contrasting  320 Cannabis sp. cultivated in field versus enclosed environments, we would expect field 
14 
Page 14 of 37 
321 grown plants to be exposed to a lower average growth temperature (i.e., subject to daily  
322 temperature fluctuations) while also exposed to increased water stress and increased  Accepted Manuscript 
323 irradiance. While limited research has been conducted on inflorescence waxes, previous  324 studies on leaf waxes may provide some explanations for these wax distributions and  325 abundances. 
326 
327 The chain-length distribution of n-alkanes on leaves has been linked to various  328 environmental parameters, due to the functionality of waxes in controlling water loss  329 [51]. Recent studies of woody tree species have shown relationships between leaf wax  330 chain-length distributions and growth temperature, in which higher growth temperatures  331 were correlated with increased abundances of longer n-alkane chain lengths (e.g., ACL)  332 [41, 52, 53]. ACL values in forbs, grasses, shrubs, and trees have also been shown to vary  333 with aridity, suggesting that plant water relations may additionally influence chain-length  334 distributions [46, 54-59]. In addition to elevated growth temperature and lower water  335 stress, plants cultivated in enclosed environments likely were grown using managed light  336 systems with lower irradiance. It is well established that fatty acid synthesis is strongly  337 connected to illumination levels, as the pathway requires both ATP and NADPH from the  338 light reactions (Sauer and Heise, 1983, Sasaki et al., 1997). Further, Shepard et al. (1995,  339 1997) showed that irradiance levels affected lipid production, with plants grown under  340 high-light natural environments producing leaf waxes with shorter chain lengths. While  341 limited research has been carried out on inflorescence lipids, our data are consistent with  342 these factors, as it would be expected that Cannabis plants cultivated in field  343 environments would be exposed to a decreased average growth temperature, increased 
15 
Page 15 of 37 
344 water stress, and increased irradiance. These hypothesized drivers of variations in  
345 inflorescence lipid concentrations and distribution could be more fully evaluated through  Accepted Manuscript 
346 multi-factor growth chamber experiments, which are beyond the scope of this study.  347 
348 3.2 Carbon isotopes of n-alkanes from Cannabis inflorescences  
349 As n-C29 was the most abundant n-alkane homologue extracted from Cannabis sp. inflorescences, we report δ13C values of n-C29 (δ13 350 Cn-C29) exclusively. We found the  δ13 351 Cn-C29 values of Cannabis sp. inflorescences ranged between −56.9 ‰ and −28.9 ‰,  with an average δ13 352 Cn-C29 value of −37.3 ± 4.4 ‰ (n = 72, Table 1). A significant  difference in δ13 353 C values occurred between plants grown in enclosed environments versus  354 open field conditions [Welch t-test, t(14.2) = 2.387, p = 0.031]. Here the plants cultivated  in open field environments had more positive δ13 355 Cn-alkane values (−36.2 ± 1.5 ‰)  356 compared to the plants cultivated in enclosed environments (−41.3 ± 8.2 ‰) (Table 2).  357 
The large variability in δ13 358 Cn-C29 values from plants grown in enclosed environments is  most likely due to variations in the δ13 359 C values of the source CO2 available to plants  during growth. CO2 within enclosed settings tends be more depleted in 13 360 C compared to  361 well mixed, outdoor settings for two reasons. First, the lack of sufficient air circulation  results in the build up of plant-respired CO2, which is 13 362 C depleted relative to the ambient  363 air. Second, to elevate plant growth, horticulturalists and agronomists tend to raise CO2 364 levels within indoor growth environments through the addition of CO2. Commercial  365 supplemental CO2 is most often fossil fuel- or biogenic-derived. Bottled CO2 from either fossil fuels or biogenic processes typically has much lower δ13 366 C values compared to 
16 
Page 16 of 37 
global atmospheric CO2, resulting in indoor grown plants with extremely low δ13 367 C values  
(Farquhar et al., 1989). The lowest δ13 368 Cn-C29 values observed in this dataset were between  Accepted Manuscript 
−60 ‰ and −50 ‰ (Figure 1) and would correspond to a source CO2 with a δ13 369 C value  of approximately −35 ‰ to −25 ‰ [60], equivalent to fossil fuel-derived CO2 with a δ13 370 C  371 value of −37 ‰ to −28 ‰ [61, 62]. However, Cannabis plants grown in enclosed  372 environments within a well-ventilated atmosphere that allows mixing of CO2 with the  external atmosphere can produce δ13 373 C values similar to plants grown in open settings.  This may explain why the majority of indoor-grown plants have δ13 374 Cn-C29 values similar  to the δ13 375 Cn-C29 values of plants grown under open field conditions (Figure 1).  376 
377 We note that a single Cannabis sp. inflorescence sample from a plant assigned as having  been cultivated within an enclosed environment had a δ13 378 Cn-C29 value of −28.9 ‰, more  positive relative to the δ13 379 Cn-C29 values of plants grown in open field environments  (Figure 1). There are two potential explanations for this very positive δ13 380 Cn-C29 value.  381 First, this plant was possibly grown in a field setting but incorrectly assigned as indoor  382 grown in the DEA records during confiscation and eradication. A second possibility is  383 this plant was grown in bottled CO2 that had been derived from volcanic or geothermal  384 sources [63].

386 3.3 Apparent fractionation between inflorescence n-alkanes and bulk Cannabis  387 inflorescences
17 
Page 17 of 37 
The δ13C value of bulk inflorescence (δ13CBulk) linearly correlated with the δ13 388 Cn-C29 value  
389 collected from the same sample (Figure 2). A total least squares regression line fitted to  Accepted Manuscript 
390 the paired data was described by the equation: 
391 
δ13Cn-C29 = 0.95×δ13CBulk – 9.6 ‰ (r2 392 = 0.94, F1, 71 = 1149.2, p < 0.0001), Equation 5.  393 
394 The slope was not different than 1 at α = 0.01. Total least squares regression lines fitted  395 to the paired data separated by enclosed versus open growth settings was described by the  396 equations: 
397 
Enclosed: δ13Cn-C29 = 1.0×δ13CBulk – 7.2 ‰ (r2 398 = 0.99, F1, 14 = 1304.4, p < 0.0001),  399 Equation 6, and 
400 
Open: δ13Cn-C29 = 0.90×δ13CBulk – 11.1 ‰ (r2 401 = 0.50, F1, 56 = 55.1, p < 0.0001), 402 Equation 7, respectively. 
403 
When compared, we found the slopes for δ13Cn-C29 values versus δ13 404 CBulk for the two  405 growth settings were not different (p > 0.01) from one another (Figure 2). However, the  406 intercepts for these regressions were different and thus, cannot be described by a single  407 slope and intercept, possibly suggesting different behaviors between the two growth  408 settings. 
409
18 
Page 18 of 37 
410 We found the apparent fractionation (εapp) between n-C29 extracted from Cannabis sp.  
411 inflorescence and bulk Cannabis sp. inflorescence materials ranged between −11.3 ‰  Accepted Manuscript 
412 and −4.8 ‰ in individual samples, with an average of −8.0 ± 1.1 ‰ (n = 72, Table 1). A  413 significant difference was found between the plants grown within an enclosed system  414 versus those grown in field environments [Welch t-test, t(27.0) = 3.869, p = 0.0006],  415 where the plants grown in enclosed environments had a more positive εapp value (−7.3 ± 416 0.8 ‰, n = 15) compared to the plants grown in open field environments (−8.2 ± 1.0 ‰, n  417 = 57) (Table 2).  
418 
419 Considering the distinction in absolute abundance of n-alkanes between the plants grown  420 under the two growth settings, an apparent difference in fractionation may not be  421 unexpected. Bulk isotope analysis represents a cumulative measurement of all chemical  422 constituents and tissues, whereas compound-specific isotope analysis explicitly isolates  423 individual components from the bulk material. The compounds of interest to this study  424 are the n-alkyl lipids, but Cannabis sp. is well known for producing a wide variety of  425 other compounds, particularly terpenoids [27, 30, 32]. The carbon isotopic fractionation  426 during terpenoid biosynthesis has been characterized and the apparent fractionation  427 during biosynthesis, as measured relative to bulk leaf tissue, is significantly less negative  428 than that observed for n-alkyl lipids [24, 64]. Considering the bulk isotope measurement  429 represents the analysis of a complex mixture of these compounds, in addition to many  430 others with less understood carbon isotopic signatures and fractionations, it should be  expected that the bulk δ13 431 C value of Cannabis sp. might be significantly influenced by  432 variations in the combination of these chemical components. As we do not have direct 
19 
Page 19 of 37 
433 measurements of source CO2, we cannot assess if the difference in εapp between n-alkanes  
434 extracted from Cannabis sp. inflorescence and bulk Cannabis sp. inflorescence materials  Accepted Manuscript 
435 for the two growth environments is affected by the environmental conditions or if the  436 difference is due to variation in chemical composition. Nonetheless, these data support  437 the notion that compound-specific isotope measurements provide a more direct measure  438 of plant biochemistry and ecology than bulk isotope measurements.  
439 
440 3.4 Potential applications of inflorescence n-alkanes in emerging marijuana markets 441 
442 Stable isotope analyses of marijuana have a demonstrated potential to improve the  443 forensic and law enforcement communities’ understanding of marijuana production  methods, growth setting, and trafficking networks [1-3]. In this respect, δ13 444 C—as well as  nitrogen (δ15 445 N)—isotope values have proven moderately useful. In a series of papers,  446 Shibuya and colleagues demonstrated the potential to differentiate three of the five major  447 production regions of marijuana cultivation in Brazil based on observed differences in the  bulk δ13C and δ15 448 N isotope values of seized marijuana samples [4, 5]. West and others  449 followed with a study of eradicated and seized material from the U.S., but could not to  distinguish region-of-origin based on bulk δ13C and δ15 450 N values alone [6]. While growth  451 location could not be assigned in that work, the growth setting could be identified using  δ13 452 C values of bulk materials (e.g., leaves, inflorescence) as plants grown in field  453 environments had unique values compared to plants grown within an enclosed  454 glass/hothouse system [6]. Following on these findings, Hurley et al. (2010a) developed a  cultivation model that defined theoretical cut-off limits for δ13 455 CBulk, where values more 
20 
Page 20 of 37 
456 negative than −32.0 ‰ were indicative of Cannabis plants grown in enclosed  
457 environments and values more positive than −29.0 ‰ were plants grown outdoors.  Accepted Manuscript 
458 Values more positive than −32.0 ‰ and more negative than −29.0 ‰ could either be  459 assigned to plants grown outdoors in shaded conditions or indoors [38]. The authors  460 found in a blind test of their model that 88 % of indoor-grown plants were correctly  
461 identified as to growth setting, while 98 % of outdoor-grown plants were correctly  462 assigned [38].  
463 
We tested the application of this cultivation model to δ13 464 Cn-C29 values measured in the  current study by converting δ13Cn-C29 values to δ13 465 CBulk values using εapp (Figure 3).  466 Assignments of plants cultivated in enclosed environments, shaded or enclosed  467 environments, or open field environments were made for all 72 specimens using the  468 average εapp values between n-C29 and Cannabis inflorescences from this study. Here,  469 when the average εapp value between Cannabis n-C29 and inflorescence is used (−8.0 ‰),  470 we found that 7 plants were assigned to enclosed environments, 20 were assigned to  471 either shaded open environments or enclosed environments, and 45 were assigned to  472 open field environments. In this exercise, 98 % of the Cannabis plants cultivated  473 outdoors were correctly identified and 60 % of the plants cultivated in enclosed  474 environments were assigned correctly. These finding indicate that by using the Cannabis  inflorescence-specific εapp value for calculating δ13 475 CBulk values and assigning growth  476 setting, the overall reliability of the model was 90%. 
477 
The δ13 478 C values presented here for the n-C29 from inflorescence suggest that the 21 
Page 21 of 37 
479 cultivation environment (e.g., growth setting) could be established with either bulk plant  
material or compound-specific inflorescence δ13 480 C values. However, increased reliability  Accepted Manuscript 
481 may be achieved if inflorescence n-alkane concentrations and distributions were included  482 in the model allowing for a growth setting-specific εapp value to be used (Table 2). A  483 specific advantage of compound-specific isotope measurements is that bulk tissue is not  484 needed to make an isotopic measurement and these specific compounds may be isolated  485 from complex mixtures such as Cannabis extracts and infused products. While  486 stringently controlled growth experiments are needed to determine the specific  487 mechanism(s) behind the findings presented here, this study of plants grown in “real  488 world” settings demonstrates that the carbon isotope ratios and concentrations of n 489 alkanes has the potential to become an ideal regulatory tool to establish growth settings of  490 Cannabis materials post-harvest.  
491 
492 4. Conclusions 
493 
494 Here we presented chain-length distributions and concentrations of n-alkanes, plus  495 carbon isotope ratios of n-C29 extracted from Cannabis sp. inflorescences. We found  496 chain-length distributions, concentrations, and carbon isotope variations of these lipids  497 relate to growth setting. While the biosynthetic mechanism is unknown, we found that  498 inflorescences of Cannabis sp. have nearly 3-times the concentrations of n-alkanes than  499 the average angiosperm leaf and that Cannabis plants grown under field conditions have  500 significantly more inflorescence n-alkanes relative to plants grown within enclosed  501 environments. Carbon isotope ratios of Cannabis sp. inflorescences largely reflect the 
22 
Page 22 of 37 
502 isotope composition of source CO2, which can vary greatly in enclosed environments. In  
503 addition, we found that n-alkanes from Cannabis plants grown within enclosed  Accepted Manuscript 
environments had a large range of δ13 504 C values with both the most positive and most  negative δ13 505 C values in this dataset reported.  
506 
507 Together, these findings suggest that inflorescence lipid distributions, concentrations, and  508 carbon isotope values have the potential to be used to identify the growth setting of  509 Cannabis sp. plants. As legal and illegal commercial production of marijuana increases,  510 the need to establish the growth setting of Cannabis will also increase. Many  511 communities, municipalities, and jurisdictions in the U.S. where Cannabis production is  512 legal now regulate how the product is grown. With additional jurisdictions seeking to  513 legalize marijuana usage for both medical and recreational purposes, state and federal  514 regulators will need additional analytical tools to certify a Cannabis products cultivation  515 setting. In this study, we show that distributions, concentrations, and carbon isotopic  516 variations in specific inflorescence lipids are related to growth setting and suggest that  517 this tool may potentially be useful to support or refute a producer’s claim regarding the  518 growth setting of Cannabis.

δ13C values of CO2 of the growth environment controlled the δ13 705 C values of n-C29. 706 
Cannabis cultivated in enclosed environments had significantly lower δ13 707 C values. 708 
The correct growth environment was assigned 90 % of time from δ13 709 C values of n-C29. 710 
711 Inflorescence n-alkanes may be used to trace the cultivation method of Cannabis. 712
