abstract 
Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the most notable Cannabis components with pharmacological activity and their content in the plant flowers and extracts are considered as critical quality parameters. The new Medical Cannabis industry needs to adopt the quality standards of the phar maceutical industry, however, the variability of phytocannabinoids content in the plant material often exerts an issue in the inconsistency of the finished product quality parameters. Sampling problems and sample representativeness is a major limitation in the end-point testing, particularly when the expected variation of the product quality parameters is high. Therefore, there is an obvious need for the introduction of Process Analytical Technology (PAT) for continuous monitoring of the critical quality parameters throughout the production processes. Infrared spectroscopy is a promising analytical tech nique that is consistent with the PAT requirements and its implementation depends on the advances in instrumentation and chemometrics that will facilitate the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the technique. Our present work aims in highlighting the potential of mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy as PAT in the quantification of the main phytocannabinoids (THC and CBD), considered as critical quality/- material parameters in the production of Cannabis plant and extract. A detailed assignment of the bands related to the molecules of interest (THC, CBD) was performed, the spectral features of the decarboxyla tion of native flowers were identified, and the specified bands for the acid forms (THCA, CBDA) were assigned and thoroughly explained. Further, multivariate models were constructed for the prediction of both THC and CBD content in extract and flower samples from various origins, and their prediction ability was tested on a separate sample set. Savitskzy-Golay smoothing and the second derivative of the native MIR spectra (1800–400 cm 1 region) resulted in best-fit parameters. The PLS models presented

satisfactory R2Y and RMSEP of 0.95 and 3.79% for THC, 0.99 and 1.44% for CBD in the Cannabis extract 
samples, respectively. Similar statistical indicators were noted for the Partial least-squares (PLS) models 
for THC and CBD prediction of decarboxylated Cannabis flowers (R2Y and RMSEP were 0.99 and 2.32% for 
THC, 0.99 and 1.33% for CBD respectively). The VIP plots of all models demonstrated that the THC and CBD 
distinctive band regions bared the highest importance for predicting the content of the molecules of 
interest in the respected PLS models. The complexity of the sample (plant tissue or plant extract), the 
variability of the samples regarding their origin and horticultural maturity, as well as the non 
uniformity of the plant material and the flower-ATR crystal contact (in the case of Cannabis flowers) were 
governing the accuracy descriptors. Taking into account the presented results, ATR-MIR should be consid 
ered as a promising PAT tool for THC and CBD content estimation, in terms of critical material and quality 
parameters for Cannabis flowers and extracts.

1. Introduction 
Cannabis sativa L., Cannabaceae, has a long history of exploita tion as a medicine, in pain relief and epilepsy, and also in food, tex tile, and paper industries [1,2]. The scientific research of Cannabis sativa demonstrates an exponential increase in the past 30 years, as most of its ingredients were isolated and characterized, but the breakthrough was achieved in the discovery of the endogenous cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system [3]. Also, many study results, personal and anecdotal testimonies changed the public perception, asserting pressure for legislation changes in the definition of Cannabis as a Schedule 1 substance resulting in passing laws that legalize its use for medical purposes. Even though each country/state that passed such law brought specific provisions that vary considerably (for distribution through dispen saries, permitted amounts per patient), the common feature of these laws is that they permit the legal use of cannabis for medical treatment if the patient has obtained appropriate medical autho rization [4]. 
Such legislation changes paved the road for industrialization of the Cannabis products for medical purposes. However, the new Medical Cannabis industry needs to adopt the quality standards of the pharmaceutical industry and at the same time satisfy the specific requirements of Cannabis-legislation. This means that the Cannabis products for medicinal use need to comply with its established quality parameters and standards and to be manufac tured under cGMP regulations. 
Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are well known phytocannabinoids, considered as the most notable Canna bis components with pharmacological activity [5]. THC acts mostly as a CB1 receptor agonist, leading to its distinguished psychoactive and pain relief effects, while CBD works through a variety of phar macological pathways, including inhibition of endocannabinoid reuptake, activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and G protein-coupled receptor 55 [6,7]. Considering their immense importance in the overall pharmacological activity, as well as the current Cannabis legislation restrictions, related to the THC content of some classes of Cannabis products, one could entitle the content of CBD and THC as critical quality parameters of Cannabis products. The CBD and THC content could also be con sidered as critical material parameters when Cannabis flowers are used as starting material in the production. The quality control of Cannabis inflorescence and chemotype differentiation is a subject of many Pharmacopoeias [8–11] focus on the assay of the content of five main cannabinoids CBDA, CBD, CBN, D9THC and D9-THCA. The above-referenced Pharmacopoeias comprise monographs on cannabis defining the dried drug or herbal substance ‘‘Cannabis inflorescence” that contains a minimum of 90 and a maximum of 110% the amounts of cannabinoids such as D9-THC and CBD, as well as Cannabinoid carboxylic acids such as D9-THCA and CBDA, calculated as D9-THC or CBD, based on the dried drug. Depending

on the content of D9-THC and CBD, authorities have classified gen erally three chemotypes of Cannabis sativa L.: D9-THC predominant type, i.e. drug-type (CBD/D9-THC = 0–0.005), CBD predominant type, i.e. fiber type (‘‘hemp” type) (CBD/D9-THC = 1 5.0–25.0) and intermediate chemotype (CBD/D9-THC = 0.5–3.0) [12]. Regarding cannabis extracts, so far the German pharmacopeia [8] recognizes discontinued cannabis extract - Cannabis extractum normatum defining as an extract from whole or shredded, flower ing, dried shoot tips of the female plants of Cannabis sativa L. that contains D9-THC at least 1% and at most 25% (m/m) for the extract, and CBD maximum 10% (m/m) for the extract. The chemical com plexity of cannabis makes its pharmaceutical standardization chal lenging. Thus, chemical characterization must include well-defined methodologies that would characterize the plant chemotype and the herbal drug as well as extraction procedures. It was found that the concentrations of target cannabinoids obtained for the same plant chemotype originating from different suppliers could vary for more than 25% [12]. Scientific and technological development in regard to Cannabis sativa began, highlighting the need of sensi tive, specific and robust analytical methods for identification and quantification of the active constituents of Cannabis sativa. 
Gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (HPLC) are regarded as analytical methods of choice for the quantifica tion of phytocannabinoids [13]. Both are relatively slow and costly techniques and require sample preparation that involves at least extraction of the ingredients with organic solvents. Since quality assessment in the current Medical Cannabis industry relies on end-product testing, these techniques are vastly employed. However, the variability of phytocannabinoids content in the plant material often exerts an issue in the inconsistency of the finished product quality parameters. Sampling problems and sample representativeness is a major limitation in the end-point testing, particularly when the expected variation of the product quality parameters is high. Usually, physical limitations (i.e. use of an inappropriate sampling thief, or/and sample volume) pre vent the test sample analysis to adequately represent the whole batch variability [14]. Besides, the critical quality parameters are not monitored frequently during the production process, thus lacking the knowledge for appropriate identification of critical process parameters in the process optimization. Therefore, there is an obvious need for the introduction of the concept of quality by design (QbD) in Cannabis products manufacturing, which means that product quality should be scientifically designed to meet specific objectives, not merely empirically derived from the performance of test batches. In this manner, the product and process characteristics important to desired performance must be derived from a combination of prior knowledge and vast experimental assessment during product development. The generated data will result in the construction of a multivariate model linking product and process measurements and desired parameters [15].

Implementation of Process Analytical Technology (PAT) is an important QbD tool aimed to increase the understanding essential for the quality throughout the manufacturing process, which became recognizable in the Pharmaceutical industry by the initia tive launched by the FDA [16]. Infrared spectroscopy is a promising analytical technique that is consistent with the PAT requirements of the FDA guidelines, and its implementation depends on the advances in instrumentation and chemometrics that will facilitate the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the technique. 
In the literature, few attempts have been made to introduce near-infrared spectroscopy for quantification of phytocannabi noids in plant material [17], in liquid pharma-grade Cannabis for mulations [18] and for growth-staging of Cannabis [19]. To the best of our knowledge, so far no scientific papers are addressing the capability of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) for quantification of phytocannabinoids in Cannabis plant material and extract. 
Therefore, our present work aims in highlighting the potential of mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy as PAT in the quantification of the main phytocannabinoids (THC and CBD), considered as crit ical quality/material parameters in the production of Cannabis plant and extract. To achieve our goals, we have performed MIR analysis of Cannabis flowers (plant material) and Cannabis extracts from various randomized sources with various CBD and THC con

tent and employed a multivariate statistical approach to develop and optimize the calibration models. Furthermore, a prediction set was used to estimate the prediction capability of each MIR model against the referent analytical technique (HPLC). 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Samples – Thermally untreated air dried Cannabis flowers (FL) 
Two Cannabis sativa strains, Bedrocan (Cannabis sativa L. ‘Afina’) and Bedrolite (Cannabis sativa L. ‘Elida’) were obtained. Bedrocan sample features high THCA content and low CBDA content, cultivar type I (FL1), whereas the Bedrolite contains a high content of CBDA and low content of THCA, cultivar type II (FL2). The samples were thermally-unaffected, only left air-dried to obtain maximum 10 wt % water content. 
2.2. Samples – Thermally treated Cannabis dry flowers (FLT) 
Forty five flowers left for analysis at the Centre for Natural Prod ucts Analysis (Faculty of Pharmacy), originating from various and different randomized crops, were used. 0.5 g of each drug was placed in a flask and moved to the oven (120  C, 60 min) to proceed with the decarboxylation reaction (THCA ? THC; CBDA ? CBD). Afterward, the samples were immediately subjected to an HPLC analysis to obtain the content of THC and CBD. 
2.3. Samples – Cannabis extracts (Ex) 
Thirty four Cannabis extracts, supplied from the Centre for Nat ural Products Analysis (Faculty of Pharmacy), were analyzed. These extracts were randomly prepared and not origin-correlated. The samples were subjected to an HPLC analysis to obtain the content of THC and CBD.

2.4. Standard substances 
The CBD powdered standard (>99.5 wt%) originates from Gen Canna Global, USA. The THCA analytical powdered standard (98.8 wt%) was supplied from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Upon decar boxylation to 140  C, carefully guided and monitored on a hot plate, the THCA standard was quantitatively converted to THC (confirmed by HPLC analysis). 
2.5. Mid-infrared spectroscopy 
MIR spectra were collected on the attenuated total reflection (ATR) module of an Alpha Platinum ATR Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Bruker Optik, Germany). Ten milligrams of each dry sample was used for spectral acquisition whereas few drops of each extract were placed on the ATR plate compartment. After the collection of each extract IR spectrum, the solidified specimen that remained on the plate was dissolved in hexane and the com partment was cleaned to proceed with the next extract sample. Each IR spectrum was recorded in the 4000 to 400 cm 1 region and averaged from eight scans with the spectral resolution adjusted to 4 cm 1. 
2.6. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for the cultivars, FL1 and FL2 
The chromatographic analyses for the FL1 and FL2 were per formed on an integrated UPLC system Shimadzu Nexera Promi nence LC-2030C Plus Cannabis analyzer controlled by Lab Solutions version 5.92. The flow rate was set to 1 mL/min with UV detector monitoring at 220 nm and an injection volume of 5 mL. The mobile phase consisted of 64:36 (V/V) acetonitrile and (0.05%) trimethylamine, pH = 3. The HPLC column, Discovery C8 (150x4.6 mm with 5 mm particle size) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All the chemicals used were of EP grade quality and purchased from Merck. The deionized water was Still man produced with a conductivity of less than 1 mS.

2.8. Statistical analysis 
The partial least-squares analysis was employed to build calibra tion models for quantification of THC and CBD in Cannabis extract and flowers, using the spectroscopy skin of Simca14 (Umetrics, Swe den). Spectral pre-processing was performed using the spectral fil ters add-in. The correlation coefficients of both X and Y matrices (R2X and R2Y), the predictivity coefficient (Q2), root mean square error of estimation (RMSEE), and the root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSEEcv) were used as the main statistical indica tors. The VIP and coefficient plots were used for further analysis of the models. The predictive capability of the models was evaluated on separate predictive sets and the root mean square error of predic tion (RMSEP) was determined for each model.

(Table 1). The total content of both THCA and THC in the FL1 can nabis plant calculated as total THC was 18.42 wt% and the content of the CBDA and CBD calculated as CBD was below 0.2 wt%. Rather opposite content was observed in the FL2 cannabis flower [20.33 wt% total CBD vs 0.79 wt% total THC] (Table 1). 
3.2. IR spectroscopy 
3.2.1. FL samples 
The description and assignment of the IR spectra was conducted following the available literature with an emphasis of the analyti cal bands responsible for differentiation of the cannabinoids of our interest: THCA, THC, CBDA, and CBD (Fig. 1). Firstly, given the need for precise spectral examination, two air-dried, non-thermally treated flowers (FL1 and FL2) were screened (Table 1). The strik ingly various content of CBDA and THCA in these flowers enabled to ascribe the bands originating from these cannabinoids because it was assumed that the remaining content of the chemical species of the flower is rather similar and comparable (lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose and terpenes). Namely, the attempt was made to select discriminating spectral regions for THCA and CBDA native flowers that, although depict evident similarities, exhibit marked differences (Fig. 2). The apparent spectral disparity was discussed in terms of: (i) shift of the position of the dominant bands, (ii) absence/presence of discriminating bands and (iii) differences in the intensity of the identical band (Table 2). 
The applied approach was advantageous because the cannabis flowers contain various molecule species and was perplexing to specify an infrared band solely to a particular cannabinoid or ter pene analyte. Thus, the bands in the dominant THCA flower emerge at 1120, 909, and 711 cm 1 that are not registered in the CBDA flower where, on contrary, the bands at 3402 and 620 cm 1 evolved (Table 2, Fig. 2). An intensity increase of the 888 cm 1 band in the CBDA plant was observed, largely diminishing in the spectrum of the THCA flower (Fig. 2). Another apparent difference among both spectra is associated with a marked shift of the med ium to strong pair-analogues around 1570, 1250, and 1180 cm 1 (Fig. 2, Table 2). However, due to the similar structural formula of the tracked cannabinoids, we found all these regions as reliable indicators to fortify the discrimination of the THCA and CBDA molecular entities, but we will firstly focus on the interpretation towards the absent/present bands and further encompass the assignment in the appointed shifting band regions. 
The band at 3402 cm 1 found in the CBDA dominant flowers is attributed to the stretching OH vibration from the aromatic OH group situated in para-position to the carboxylic group fragment (Fig. 1c, d). This OH group is not present in the THC and THCA molecules (Fig. 1a, b) and therefore lacks in the spectrum of the FL1 cannabis cultivar (inset in Fig. 2, Table 2). On contrary, the bands at 1120 and 909 cm 1 as well as the band at 711 cm 1 in the spectrum of THCA flowers (missing in the CBDA flower spec trum) could be related to the aryl-alkyl ether group present in the THCA molecules (CBDA molecule lacks such moieties, Fig. 1) and assigned to antisymmetric and symmetric C–O–C stretching, and ring symmetric C–O–C bending vibration, respectively [20]. On the other hand, the @CH2 wagging vibrations from the (R’R’’>C@CH2 group) gave rise to the strong 888 cm 1 band regis tered in the CBDA flower spectrum because the THCA compound lacks unsaturated C@C linkage in this structural position (Fig. 1, Table 2). 
Further focus on the assignment in the appointed shifting band regions infers that the 1570 cm 1 maximum is attributed to the stretching m(–C@C–) vibration within the aromatic rings in the lig nin, cellulose and the remaining cannabis species. C–H bending

3.2.2. Thermally treated (decarboxylated) Cannabis flowers and 
extracts 
It is worth emphasizing that the decarboxylation protocol was 
delivered for non-origin correlated THC(A) and CBD(A) matrices 
of 45 thermally-treated flowers and 34 extracts. The idea was dri 
ven to develop a proper protocol that can sufficiently and reliably 
estimate the content of the major CBD and THC in any randomized 
series of flower and extract samples. For ease of interpretation, we 
have also considered the fact that the content of the acidic 
cannabinoids THCA and CBDA in the non-thermally treated sam 
ples is reasonably higher compared to the thermally treated flow 
ers. Namely, flowers dominantly contain the acidic forms of the 
cannabinoids which upon careful temperature action are decar 
boxylated and converted to THC and CBD, respectively. The results 
from the IR spectra filtered the most important regions that reflect 
(i) the major differences appearing among the different fresh flow 
ers, and (ii) other regions where the major differences occur among 
the decarboxylated flowers and extract samples in comparison to 
the spectra of the starting fresh flowers. These spectral outcomes 
were found complementary to the chemometric results (see fur 
ther discussion). 
To the best of our knowledge, the literature lacks IR band 
assignments for pure THCA, CBDA, THC and CBD, though the spec 
tral appearance of these compounds in the native form can be 
found in the German Pharmacopeia [8] (CBD), Specac App Note 
[27] (CBD), Bruker App note [28] (THC, THCA, CBDA), and PerkinEl 
mer App note [29] (THCA). The IR spectra of the acidic forms of the 
cannabinoids of interest (THCA, CBDA) were only presented (not 
discussed) by Hazekamp et al. [30] who isolated these compounds 
from the concentrated ethanolic solutions (mixed with KBr), subse 
quently evaporating the ethanol under vacuum. The band positions 
and intensities were extracted from the spectra of the THCA/THC

tion next to the carboxylic group around 1180 cm 1. However, the most intense absorption around 1250 cm 1, slightly shifted among the THCA and CBDA spectra, is ascribed to the m(C–OH) vibration from the carboxylic group since upon decarboxylation the intensity of this band majorly decreases (see forthcoming discussion). Although the precise assignment of these bands poses a great chal lenge due to the complex matrix of the samples, the proposed ten tative assignment (Table 2, Fig. 2) was made in accordance with the limited IR spectral literature data for hemp and cannabis related specimens [21–24] and the recent non-destructive Raman studies aimed to differentiate between hemp and cannabis [25,26]. 
and CBD powder standards whereas the IR bands from the CBDA cannabinoid were taken from the mentioned reference [28] (Table 3, Fig. 3). These spectra were additionally used and com pared with the spectra of the native and decarboxylated flowers and extracts that markedly helped in the band assignments (Table 3, Fig. 3). 
The most abrupt spectral difference evidenced upon decarboxy lation of the flowers is depicted by the increase of the intensity of the bands around 1510, 1430, 1260, 1180, 1040 and 835 cm 1 (Fig. 3a–c, rectangular regions). The obtained result infer that the emerging bands most likely arise from the vibrations within the THC and CBD units whose content increased upon heating, as the presence of the corresponding acidic forms is majorly reduced. The drawn assumptions were confirmed by comparison of the ana lyzed native and decarboxylated spectra with the spectra of pure cannabinoids (Fig. 3e, f, g). Thus, the medium band at 1510 cm 1

occurs from both the CBD and THC (very weak in the spectra of the acidic forms) (Fig. 3) and intensity increase upon flower decar boxylation infers increase of their content. In addition, the striking rise of the band at 1424 cm 1 (Fig. 3a, b vs Fig. 3c, d) is attributed to the vibrations from the THC molecules since its intensity domi nates in the IR spectrum of the pure THC (Fig. 3g) and the CBD lacks this IR absorption band (Fig. 3e, Table 3). A similar conclusion is derived for the bands at 1267, 1038 and 835 cm 1 in the decar boxylated flower spectrum (Fig. 3c) that are the strongest band 


	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	

	



in the THC and either very weak or absent in the CBD counterpart (Table 3). Furthermore, the bands at 1621 and 1578 cm 1 are blue shifted in the heated samples (Fig. 3c, d) in comparison to fresh THCA dominant flowers (1614 and 1565 cm 1, Fig. 3a) and pure THCA spectrum (1614 and 1563 cm 1, Fig. 3f). This outcome strongly reflects that, upon heating, the THCA conversion to THC might be successfully monitored by infrared spectroscopy even in the complex matrix. Similarly, the recent Raman spectroscopy work for non-invasive and non-destructive differentiation between

hemp and cannabis attributed the bands at 1623 and 1295 cm 1 to THCA/THC species assigning the former one to their aromatic ring vibration [26]. 
On contrary, the heated flowers (Fig. 3c) contracted the intensi ties of strong 888 and 620 cm 1 bands found in the fresh CBDA rich flowers (Fig. 3b) that are obviously attributed to the CBDA mole cules. Namely, these bands are crucial to determine the presence of the CBDA compound (spectrum not shown here) appearing as the strongest peaks in the pure sample [28] (Table 3). Moreover, their absence in the THCA counterpart infers that these bands are analyt ical signatures to follow the transformation of CBDA into CBD. It is also worth mentioning that the IR spectra of the decarboxylated flowers made possible to discriminate between CBDA and CBD on one hand and the THCA and THC on the other. Moreover, the spectra of the decarboxylated flowers and the fabricated extracts are practi cally identical (Fig. 3c, d). Thus, the band discussion for the spectrum of the decarboxylated flower is also valid for the bands in the spec trum of the cannabis extract. This approach derived from the IR results for the native and decarboxylated flowers was further con firmed by the chemometric model encompassing the most discrim inating bands at 1580, 1430, 1183 and 1040 cm 1 as predictors for THC concentration (see forthcoming discussion). 
3.3. Chemometric approach for MIR spectra quantification of THC and CBD 
PLS approach was employed for building separate calibration models for the quantitative determination of CBD and THC from flowers and extract samples. The HPLC determined concentrations of CBD and THC were appointed as dependent (Y) variables, while the MIR spectra were denominated as independent (X) or predictor variables. 
3.3.1. Statistical models for decarboxylated Cannabis extracts Fourteen MIR spectra acquired from different cannabis extract samples were used to construct the calibration set whereas the remaining 20 spectra were used for the prediction set. The CBD and THC concentrations in the samples varied between 0.38– 39.2% and 18.93–86.99%, respectively (HPLC determined). Only the spectral region of 1800–400 cm 1 was used for the statistical modeling because the ATR diamond crystal exhibit two-photon broad IR absorbance bands between 2600 and 1900 cm 1 that reduce the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the MIR region above 2600 cm 1 did not contain any specific bands originating from the molecules of interest. The preliminary analysis of the models revealed that Savitskzy-Golay smoothing and the second deriva tive of the native MIR spectra resulted in best-fit parameters for R2Y, R2X (the cumulative explained fraction of the variation in the Y and X blocks of variables) and Q2 (the cumulative fraction of total variation in the dependent variables, that can be predicted with the model). The overlaid spectra from the calibration and pre diction set, colored according to the THC and CBD content of the samples are presented in Fig. 4a and b. Considering that CBD and THC were not the sole components in the extract and that the sam ples originated from different sources (different Cannabis flowers, extraction methods etc.), it is logical to assume that some transfor mation of the spectra will be needed to separate and potentiate the specific bands with quantitative relationship to the components of interest. Therefore, in the further part, only the model based on the abovementioned transformation will be presented and discussed. Three main components were extracted from the PLS model for quantification of THC with 0.934, 0.951 and 0.909 for R2X, R2Y and Q2. The score scatter plot (Fig. 5a) for this model reveals distinctive pattern of the sample variances that can be traced to the concen tration of THC in the samples. Indeed, these plots reveal how

the X variables are related to each other [31]. In this model, there is a clear trend of distinction among the spectra (X variables) along the t1 vector (the first component) related to the THC concentra tion of the samples, thus pointing out the dominant role of the first component in the overall prediction capability of the model. Fur thermore, the VIP (Variance important for projection) plot (Fig. 5b) reveals the spectral regions with the utmost importance in the regression model. The bands with VIP factor larger than 1, are usually considered as important both for explaining the varia tions in the X matrix as well as to correlate with the Y variables [32]. The spectral regions around 1040, 1425, 1183 and

The latter could be additionally confirmed with the coefficient plot (Fig. 5c), where the mentioned spectral regions are assigned with the largest regression coefficients. The plotted results of actual (HPLC determined) versus the predicted THC concentrations (MIR spectra) are presented in Fig. 5d, and the RMSEE (Root Mean Square Error of Estimation) of 4.67% indicates the fit of the observations to the model. The RMSEcv for this model is 5.25% and it is an analogous measure to RMSEE, but estimated using a cross-validation procedure. The RMSEE and RMSEcv are descriptors

for the absolute accuracy of the model, and the values reported here should be expected, taking into consideration the variable ori gin of the samples (different matrices), number of samples, the employed concentration range, and the real limits of the analytical technique (ATR-MIR). 
Three main components were also extracted from the CBD quan tification PLS model with 0.936, 0.991 and 0.972 for R2X, R2Y and Q2. In this model, the score scatter plot (Fig. 5e) also presents a dis tinctive pattern related to the CBD concentration in the samples that follow a diagonal line between both score vectors (t1/t2), indicating that both the first and second component has significant capabilities for prediction of the Y variable. The VIP plot (Fig. 5f) demonstrated that the same spectral regions of the previous model (1577, 1425, 1183, and 1040 cm 1), with an addition of the region around 880 cm 1 (also determined by the IR spectra, Fig. 3). These regions bear the largest VIP factors, and at the same time, the mentioned spectral ranges are assigned with the largest regression coefficients (Fig. 5g). The plot of actual versus predicted CBD concentrations (Fig. 5h) reveals a better fit of the points relative to the previous THC model with 1.21 and 2.62% for RMSEE and RMSEcv. 
The predictive capabilities of both models were evaluated sep arately on a prediction (training) set of 20 extract samples of var ious origin and the results are presented in Fig. 6a and b. The root mean square error of prediction, (RMSEP) for THC and CBD PLS quantification models were 3.79 and 1.44%, respectively, thus con firming the previous accuracy descriptors and ruling out the possi ble bias of the calibration models. 
3.3.2. Statistical models for decarboxylated Cannabis flowers The PLS models for the quantification of THC and CBD in decar boxylated Cannabis flowers also employed the second derivatives of the raw MIR spectra (1800–400 cm 1) with Savitsky-Golay smoothing. The overlaid spectra from the 45 samples used in the calibration and prediction set, colored according to the THC and CBD content of the samples are presented in Fig. 7a and b. As in the previous case, such transformation was chosen as the most optimal regarding the main fit parameters (R2Y, R2X and Q2) in comparison to the raw, SNV and first order derivative MIR spectra models. Such data transformation is often considered as a necessity in cases where spectra from complex matrices are obtained and the main quantification related bands are overlapped with other com ponents present in the sample. 
The THC PLS quantification model was build using transformed spectra acquired from 15 decarboxylated samples with various THC content and origin (30 samples were left for the training set). Five main components were extracted from the model explaining 97.2% of the variations in the X-variables, and produc ing a high correlation coefficient R2Y = 0.992 with appropriate pre dictability (Q2 = 0.891). The score scatter plot of the second and 
11
third component vectors reveal the THC content related pattern, where the THC content increases as a function of the score in both components (Fig. 8a). The model VIP plot (Fig. 8b) exposes the bands that are related to the THC content in the flowers. The spec tral regions around 1620, 1610, 1578, 1425, 1180, 1038, 1010 and 825 cm 1 which are similar to the ones reported in the extract PLS models, are also assigned with large VIP factors. The coefficient plot confirms the previous findings, where the abovementioned spectral regions with the highest VIP factors, are also assigned with the highest regression coefficients (Fig. 8c). The RMSEE and RMSEEcv derived from the actual versus predicted THC concentra tions plot (Fig. 8d) were 0.43 and 1.53%. The complexity of the sample (plant tissue), the variability of the samples in regards to their origin and horticultural maturity, as well as the non uniformity of the plant material and the flower-ATR crystal contact should be considered as main factors that govern the accuracy descriptors. 
Five main components were extracted for the PLS modeling for CBD content quantification of the Cannabis flowers with R2X = 0.969, R2Y = 0.994 and Q2 = 0.66. As in the previously described model, the score scatter plot of the second and third main components vector presents a distinctive pattern associated with the CBD content in the samples (Fig. 8e). The bands around 1440, 1185, 1100, 1010, 911, 888, and 826 cm 1 demonstrated the largest VIP factors in the MIR spectra (Fig. 8f). The mentioned bands were assigned with the highest regression coefficients (model coefficient plot Fig. 8g), thus confirming their association with the CBD content. The actual versus predicted plot (Fig. 8h) of the samples demonstrates a satisfactory level of correlation and the accuracy model parameters RMSEE and RMSEEcv were 0.21 and 1.41%. 
To evaluate the predictive capability of the abovementioned PLS models for quantification of THC and CBD in decarboxylated Can nabis flowers, a separate prediction (training) set of 30 samples of different origin was employed. The correlation plots of actual versus predicted THC and CBD content are presented in Fig. 9a and b, and the models RMSEP was 2.32% and 1.33% for quantifica tion of THC and CBD, respectively. The RMSEP values are in good agreement with the accuracy descriptors of the models and con firm the presented predicting capability of the models in a separate independent set of samples. 
4. Conclusion 
In the present work, we have described a stepwise approach in the utilization of ATR-MIR spectroscopy for quantification of the main critical parameters in Cannabis flower and extract samples. A detailed assignment of the bands related to the molecules of interest (THC, CBD) was performed in accordance with the avail

able literature data. Also, the spectral features of the decarboxyla tion of native flowers were identified, and the acid forms (THCA, CBDA) specific bands were assigned and thoroughly explained. Further, multivariate models were constructed for prediction of both THC and CBD content in extract and flower samples from var ious origin, and their prediction ability was tested on a separate sample set. The PLS models presented satisfactory R2Y and RMSEP of 0.95 and 3.79% for THC, 0.99 and 1.44% for CBD in the Cannabis extract samples, respectively. Similar statistical indicators were noted for the PLS models for THC and CBD prediction of decarboxy lated Cannabis flowers (R2Y and RMSEP were 0.99 and 2.32% for THC, 0.99 and 1.33% for CBD respectively). The VIP plots of all mod els demonstrated that the THC and CBD distinctive band regions bared the highest importance for predicting the content of the molecules of interest in the respected PLS models. The complexity of the sample (plant tissue or plant extract), the limited number of samples and concentration range, the variability of the samples regarding their origin and horticultural maturity, as well as the non-uniformity of the plant material and the flower-ATR crystal contact (in the case of Cannabis flowers) should be considered as main factors that govern the accuracy descriptors. Nevertheless, it was outlined that the ATR-MIR should be considered as a promis ing PAT tool for THC and CBD content estimation, in terms of crit ical material and quality parameters for Cannabis flowers and extracts.
