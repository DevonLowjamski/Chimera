Abstract  
Cannabis has been one of the oldest source of food, textile fiber and psychotropic  substances. Cannabinoids are the main biologically active constituents of the Cannabis genus, with a demonstrated medicinal value. Its production is becoming legalized and  regulated in many countries, thus increasing the need for a rapid analysis method to  assess the content of cannabinoids. Gas chromatography (GC) is the preferred analytical  method for the determination of these compounds, although is a slow and costly  technique. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) has the potential for the quantitative  prediction of quality parameters, and also of pharmacologically active compounds, but  no references about cannabinoids prediction has been previously reported. The aim of  the present research was to develop a fast, economical, robust and environmentally  friendly method based on NIR technology that allow the quantification of the main

cannabinoids present in Cannabis sativa L. samples. A total of 189 grinded and dried  samples from different genotypes and registered varieties were used. The content of the  cannabinoids CBDV, Δ9-THCV, CBD, CBC, Δ8-THC, Δ9-THC, CBG and CBN were  determined by gas chromatography. Spectra were collected in a dispersive NIR Systems  6500 instrument, and in a Fourier transform near Iinfrared (FT-NIR) equipment. The  sample group was divided into calibration and validation sets, to develop modified  partial lest squares (PLS) regression models with WINISI IV software with the  dispersive data, and PLS models using OPUS 7.2 with the FT-NIR ones. Excellent  coefficient of determination of cross validation (R2CV from 0.91 to 0.99), were obtained  for the prediction of CBD, CBC, Δ8-THC, Δ9-THC, CBG and CBN, with standard  error of prediction (SEP) values among 1.5 - 3 times the standard error of laboratory  (SEL); and good for CBDV and Δ9-THCV cannabinoids (R2 values of 0.89 and 0.83,  respectively) with the dispersive instrument. Similar calibration and validation statistics  have been obtained with the FT-NIR instrument with the same sample sets, using its  specific OPUS software. In conclusion, a methodology of quantitative determination of  cannabinoids in Cannabis raw materials has been developed for the first time using NIR and FT-NIR instruments, with similar good predictive results. This new analytical  method would allow a simpler, more robust and precise estimation than the current  standard GC.

1. Introduction 
Cannabis sativa L. is a species characterized for the versatility of the derived  products, from food and textile fiber to psychotropic substances [1, 2, 3]. Even today it  is still cultivated for industrial purposes such as food, paper and textile production [4, 5,  6] although it is mainly consumed for recreational or medicinal purposes [7], since  Cannabis contains more than 500 different ingredients [8, 9, 10]. Chemical analysis of  Cannabis in the 1940s and 1960s led to the discovery of a unique group of  terpenophenolic secondary metabolites, known as cannabinoids, of which Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) was shown to be the primary psychoactive ingredient  [11]. 
Cannabinoids are the main biologically active constituents of the Cannabis genus and they are produced by the glandular trichomes that occur on most aerial surfaces of  the plant [12]. In 1967, Mechoulam and Gaoni [13] defined cannabinoids as the group  of C21 compounds typical of the species Cannabis sativa L., including their carboxylic  acids, analogues and transformation products. Nowadays, a new definition includes related structures or any other compound that affects cannabinoid receptor, thus an  expansion of the definition considering pharmacognostic aspects is obtained. 
The most important cannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC),  cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC) and cannabinol 
(CBN), the latter as result of a degradation process. These neutral cannabinoids do not  occur at significant concentrations in the plants. Cannabis biosynthesizes primarily the  carboxylic acid forms of Δ9-THC, CBD, CBG and CBC, namely Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), cannabigerolic acid  (CBGA) and cannabichromenic acid (CBCA), respectively.   
In 1970s, three chemotypes of Cannabis plants have been recognized based on  Δ9-THC/CBD ratio: a Δ9-THC/CBD ratio >> 1.0 is characteristic of “drug-type” plants  (chemotype I), a Δ9-THC/CBD ratio close to 1.0 is for “intermediate-type” plants  (chemotype II), and a Δ9-THC/CBD ratio << 1.0 is characteristic of “fiber-type” plants  (chemotype III) [14, 15, 16]. 
At present day almost 150 alkyl (C-5, C-3, C-1) phytocannabinoids have been reported [17] and several other chemotypes of Cannabis have been selected and  described [18]. Clinical trials on Cannabis based medicines, pure cannabinoids and  synthetic analogues have demonstrated some effectiveness as analgesics for chronic  neuropathic pain, glaucoma, nausea, asthma, depression, insomnia, neuralgia [19,20], appetite stimulants for cancer or AIDS patients [21], multiple sclerosis [22] and  palliative agents for several other disease states and symptoms [23, 24]. 
As a result of this increased clinical knowledge, Cannabis derived products are increasingly being recognized as substances with a demonstrated medicinal value, and  this is confirmed by the fact that its production and use is becoming legalized and  regulated in many countries. Breeders of medicinal Cannabis varieties carry on a  constant process of selective breeding in order to develop varieties aiming to improve  the yield of certain cannabinoids and other secondary metabolites of interest for the  pharmaceutical industry, or even to guarantee the absence or reduction of certain  unwanted molecules, as a practical example can be mentioned the reduction of Δ9-THC  in varieties with a CBD chemotype and intended to be used for controlling convulsive  seizures in epileptic children. The high intrinsic variability present in Cannabis plants  (different brands, varieties, chemotypes and gender) leads to a great difficulty in  obtaining a classification standard [25]. This has led to the need for a convenient and  rapid analytical method to provide quantitative data on the cannabinoids content of  different sources of Cannabis genetic resources and then to speed up and reduce costs of  the ongoing breeding program. 
Gas chromatography (GC) is the preferred analytical method for the determination  of these compounds since acidic cannabinoids are thermally unstable and can be 
decarboxylated when exposed to heat, becoming their respective neutral cannabinoids [26]. However, GC is a slow and costly technique, which requires a tedious sample  preparation stage involving at least the extraction of the active ingredients by using  organic solvents, whose subsequent residues must be managed with a considerable  increase of cost, time and document management.   
Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) has the potential for quantitative and  qualitative prediction of the main parameters such as protein, fat, moisture, fiber, ash,  starch or sugar content of raw materials related with the quality of the agricultural  products [27]. Cozzolino [28] reviewed applications of NIRS to the qualitative and  quantitative analysis of plant natural products. 
Regarding Cannabis plant, very few applications to qualitative and quantitative  analysis of cannabinoids have been developed and reported with NIRS. Qualitative  NIRS has been applied to discriminate between “drug-type” (chemotype I) and “fiber type” (chemotype III) [29], for spectral discrimination of Cannabis sativa L. leaves and  canopies from other plant species [30], and more recently for the prediction of the  growth stage of Cannabis plants in the early stages of an indoor cultivation [25]. With  respect to quantitative applications, only the prediction of the chemical composition of  fiber and core fraction of hemp (chemotype III) has been developed [31], and no  scientific papers have been found in the literature dealing with the ability of NIRS to  predict the content of cannabinoids in Cannabis samples. 
The aim of the present research was to develop a fast, economical, robust and  environmentally friendly method based on NIR technology that allowed the  quantification of the main cannabinoids present in Cannabis sativa L. samples.  
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Plant material and sample preparation 
A total of 189 samples of Cannabis sativa L. were used in this study. The samples  of leaves and inflorescences were selected from plants grown under different conditions and locations (i.e. indoor with diverse PAR light exposition, and in open field, high  tunnels, or high technology greenhouse), irrigation doses, plant densities, sowing times  and plant varieties. Cannabis samples used in this article have been supplied by the  company Phytoplant Research S.L., which is authorized by the Spanish Agency of 
Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS) for R&D on Cannabis breeding, cultivation  and obtainment of derived products Some samples were taken from genetic resources in  use in the internal breeding program (under the research authorization of the). The  sample set was completed with medicinal varieties in process of registration at the  Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO), which were identified by their denomination  proposals and application numbers: Aida, 2016/0167; Beatriz, 2017/0146; Enza  (Divina), 2017/0149; Juani, 2016/0117; Magda, 2017/0145; Mati, 2017/0147; Marisa  (Moniek), 2016/0114; Octavia, 2017/0148; Pilar, 2016/0115; Sara, 2015/0098 and  Theresa, 2016/0116.Industrial hemp varieties Carma and Ermes were also included in  the sample set. Besides, the samples were collected from different zones of the plant (apical, median, basal), in order to obtain samples of the same chemotype with a certain variability of the cannabinoids of interest.    
Samples of the selected plant material were processed as follows: in a standing  crop of a given variety or genotype, a 30 cm part of each plant containing leaves and at  least one female inflorescence was collected to get around 30 g of fresh vegetal  material. Plant samples were oven dried at 40 ºC for 72 hours, and the stems and seeds  of more than 2 mm in size were removed. The resulting samples were ground to obtain  a semi-fine powder, passing through a 1 mm sieve (test sample), and were used for  further analyses. 
2.2. Reference analysis of cannabinoids 
Cannabis samples were analyzed in the laboratory by gas chromatography flame  ionization detector (GC-FID) for the determination of the content of cannabinoids. 
2.2.1. Standards 
Cannabinoids standard such as, cannabidivarin (CBDV), Δ9- tetrahydrocannabivarin (Δ9-THCV), cannabichromene (CBC), delta-8  tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC), CBD, Δ9-THC, CBG and CBN were purchased from  THC Pharm (Frankfurt, Germany) with the import authorization of the AEMPS. n Hexane HPLC grade (Panreac, Barcelona, Spain) was used as extractant and squalene from Sigma-Aldrich, (St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as internal standard.  
2.2.2. Instruments
An Agilent GC 7820 series (Agilent Technologies Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA)  equipped with a 7396A autosampler and a flame ionization detector (FID) was used.  The instrument was equipped with a ZB-5MS capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm  internal diameter, film thickness 0.25 µm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), The  injector temperature was 300 ºC, with an injection volume of 1 µL in splitless mode and  a carrier gas (He) flow rate of 1.3 mL/min. The temperature gradient started at 160 ºC and linearly increased after 2 minutes at a rate of 25 ºC/min, until the temperature of  242 ºC, a linearly increased at a rate of 2 ºC/min until 250 ºC and a new linearly  increased at a rate of 25 ºC/min until the final temperature of 300 ºC which was held for  5 min. The FID detector temperature was set to 300 ºC. The device was controlled by  Agilent GC OpenLAB Workstation software.    
2.2.3. GC-FID analysis  
According with the law, an official method (EC) No 1177/2000 of 31 May 2000  Annex C, named “Community method for the quantitative determination of THC  content of hemp varieties” was used in the wet way. This method is based on the  quantitative determination of Δ9-THC by GC although slight modifications were made  in the temperature ramp of the chromatographic oven for the simultaneous  determination of cannabinoids (CBDV, Δ9-THCV, CBD, CBC, Δ8-THC, Δ9-THC,  CBG and CBN).  
Briefly, the wet analysis steps were: weigh 100 mg of the powdered test sample,  place in a centrifuge tube and add 5 mL of n-hexane containing squalene, as an internal  standard. Sonicate in an ultrasonic bath for 20 minutes. Centrifuge for five minutes at  3000 r.p.m. and then remove the supernatant cannabinoid solution. Inject the solution,  after necessary dilution, into the GC-FID to carry out a quantitative analysis. All  determinations in the laboratory were performed in duplicate, and the standard error of  laboratory (SEL) was calculated for each of the reference parameters:

Where n is the number of samples and yi1 and yi2 are values obtained for the replicates 1  and 2, respectively, of sample i.
2.3. Spectra collection   
All the 189 dried and grounded Cannabis samples were scanned consecutively in  two NIR instruments with different optical characteristics. Circular quartz cuvettes (48  mm diameter) were used as sample holders for reflectance analysis in both instruments. 
2.3.1. Dispersive NIR spectrometer 
A dispersive NIR spectrometer, NIR Systems 6500 scanning monocromator  System II (FOSS NIR Systems, Silver Spring, Maryland, USA) equipped with a  transport module, was used to measure reflectance spectra from 400 to 2498 nm, every  2 nm (Si detector for 400–1100 nm region and PbS for 1100 - 2500 nm). Circular quartz  cuvettes were placed in special holders for circular capsules. Spectral absorbance values  were recorded in reflectance mode as log 1/R, where R is the sample reflectance. During  the sample analysis, an internal white ceramic reference was scanned 16 times and  afterwards the sample was scanned 32 times, obtaining a final spectrum for each cuvette  and sample. WINISI II software version 1.50 (Infrasoft International LLC, Port Matilda,  PA, USA) was used for spectral data collection. 
2.3.2. FT-NIR spectrometer 
Fourier transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectra were recorded on a multipurpose analyzer (MPA) FT-NIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics GmbH, Ettlingen,  Germany) equipped with an integrated Michelson interferometer and a highly sensitive  PbS detector. Spectra were collected in diffuse reflectance mode in the wavenumber  range 12500–4000 cm-1(800-2500 nm), with a resolution of 8 cm-1, using the macro  sample integrating sphere measurement channel. Each spectrum was recorded as the  average of 32 subsequent scans. The background was recorded automatically with a  gold coated reference every hour, approximately. OPUS 7.2 software (Bruker Optics 
GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) was used for spectra acquisition. 
2.4. Population structuring and spectral outlier detection 
Prior to NIRS calibration development, principal components analysis (PCA), available in WINISI IV software, was performed on the full set of samples (N=189) in  order to reduce the dimensionality of the data matrix and to retain the maximal amount  of variability in the spectral data. This PCA was performed by using standard normal 
variate and detrending (SNV and DT) algorithms [32], as pre-treatments to remove the  interferences of scatter usually found in absorbance data. This pretreatment was used  together with a Norris–Williams spectral derivative “1,5,5,1”, where the first digit is the  order of the derivative, the second is the gap over which the derivative is calculated, the  third is the number of data points in a running average or smoothing, and the fourth the  second smoothing [33].   
After the PCA analysis, the center of the spectral population was determined, and  the GH value (Mahalanobis global distance to the center of the population) of each  sample calculated, in order to detect outliers. The resulting population was sorted  according to the GH value, considering as outliers those samples with GH value 3.0 or  above, which were eliminated [34]. This procedure was repeated until no outliers were  found. Before calibration development, the sample set without spectral outliers was  divided into calibration and validation sets. Hence, the samples in the validation set  were not used along the calibration process and were saved to develop external  validation. The procedure for the sample selection to integrate each group was based on  the spectral information as follows: one of each 3 sorted samples from the resulting  population in the previous PCA step were selected to build up the validation set, and the  rest remained as the calibration set. In this way, the samples of the validation set are  consistently distributed in the population [34, 35]. 
2.5 Data processing and calibration development 
Multivariate analysis was used to develop prediction equations, using the  resulting calibration and validation sample sets from the PCA without outliers. Separate  regression models were performed for each parameter in the calibration sets in both  instruments using their respective chemometric software. Cannabis spectra obtained in  the dispersive NIR Systems instrument and in the MPA FT-NIR instrument were fitted  to the content of cannabinoids determined by GC to develop the correspondent NIR  prediction equations. In this work, concentrations of zero cannabinoid found in the GC  laboratory analysis were considered as values, both in calibration and validation  procedures. 
Partial least squares (PLS) regression method was used to develop predictive  models in the FT-NIR instrument. The spectral and concentration data are first encoded  in matrix form and then reduced to few factors. Hence, the resulting spectral vectors are 
directly related to the constituents of interest. PLS1 algorithm provided by the OPUS  7.2 and Bruker Quant 2 software packs was used in this study with the FT-NIR spectra.  A modification of this methodology, available in WINISI IV software, was used for the  dispersive reflectance spectra obtained in the NIR Systems 6500 instrument, owing to  MPLS is often more stable and accurate than the standard PLS algorithm. In modified  partial least squares (MPLS) method of regression, the NIR residuals at each  wavelength, obtained after each factor is calculated, are standardized (divided by the  standard deviations of the residuals at a wavelength) before calculating the next factor.  Cross validation was used to select the optimal number of factors and to avoid  overfitting [36]. The number of PLS factors required to model the data represents the  optimal number of factors or latent variables to retain for generating a predictive model.  If this value is too small, the information of interest in the spectra is not fully utilized,  whereas if it is too big, extra noise may be included in the model. Cross validation was  performed by splitting the calibration set into four groups, according to Shenk and  Westerhaus [37] in the NIR dispersive instrument, using WINISI IV. Each group was  predicted using a calibration developed on the other samples, until all the samples have  been used for validation. Finally, validation errors were combined to obtain a standard  error of cross validation (SECV). The optimum number of factors was determined as  the one that provided the lowest SECV. For the FT-NIR calibration data set, internal  validation was performed using a leave-one-out cross validation using the OPUS  software, and the optimum number of factors was determined here as the one that  provided the lowest root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV), up to a  maximum of 12, [38].   
Multivariate regression equations for each cannabinoid were obtained in WINISI  IV after combining several spectra pretreatments in different wavelength regions. SNV  and DT [32], and multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) [39] pretreatments were used  to remove additive and multiplicative effects in the spectra, together with Norris– Williams spectral derivatives [33], to emphasize steep edges of a peak. Four of the most  usual derivative pretreatments (1, 5, 5, 1; 1, 10, 10, 1; 2, 5, 5, 1 and 2, 10, 10, 1), have  been used in this study, as described by Núñez-Sánchez [40], following Shenk and  Westerhaus [36,37] recommendations for agricultural products. Three spectral regions  were considered to develop the equations: 400-2500 nm (complete VIS+NIR region of  the NIR Systems 6500 instrument), 1100-2500 nm, as the NIR region recorded by the 
PbS detector in that instrument, and 800-2500 nm, which corresponds to the scanning  range of the FT-NIR instrument (9000-4000 cm-1). Hence, twenty-four regression  equations per parameter were developed by combining four spectral derivative math  treatments and two scatter correction methods in three spectral regions. Two passes of  elimination of T outlier samples (samples with abnormally high residuals of predicted  versus reference values), were applied. A critical T value of 2.5 was set for T outliers.   
In OPUS 7.2 software, several spectral pre-processing methods available in the  Quant 2 algorithm were applied: first and second derivatives, first derivative combined  with vector normalization (similar to the SNV treatment), and first derivative combined  with MSC. Besides, a set of five frequency regions typical for NIR applications were  used to optimize the models: 9400-7500, 7500-6100, 6100-5450, 5450-4600 and 4600- 4250 cm-1. These five frequency regions are tested on their own and in all possible  combinations [38]. 
The performance of the calibration models was evaluated using the standard error  of calibration (SEC), the coefficient of determination for calibration (R2), the standard  error of cross validation (SECV) and the coefficient of determination for cross  validation (R2CV) [36,41] provided by the WINISI IV software. Similarly, the  performance of the PLS models developed with OPUS Quant 2 algorithm was evaluated  in terms of the root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and cross validation  (RMSECV), together with the R2and R2CV provided by this software. 
The predictive ability of the equations was assessed by external validation, by  means of a simple regression between NIRS predicted values and reference data. Hence,  the models developed with the strategies described above were applied to the validation  sample sets, which had not been used in the calibration procedures. Hence, the  comparison of lab data versus predicted data provided the SEP value (standard error of  prediction) or RMSEP (root mean square error of prediction) in WINISI IV and OPUS,  respectively, together with the slope and regression coefficients (RSQ). Furthermore,  paired t-test was performed to evaluate the significance of the differences between  laboratory and predicted results of models in both instruments, in the validation sets. 
Additionally, the RPD (residual predictive deviation) statistic, or ratio of the  standard deviation (SD) of the original data to the SEP (SD/SEP) in WINISI models, or  to the RMSEP (SD/RMSEP) in OPUS models, according to Williams [41], was used to 
evaluate the predictive ability of the models. This statistic is provided by the OPUS  software, whereas it has to be calculated for the WINISI IV equations.   
For each cannabinoid, the best model was selected according to the higher R2CV and RPD values and lower SECV or RMSECV and SEP or RMSEP, in both  instruments. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Cannabinoids data 
The strategy followed to select the plant material to generate the calibration set consisted on choosing Cannabis samples of different chemotypes from 11 medicinal  varieties in process of registration at CPVO and 27 other genetic resources, which were  characterized by different chemotypes, cultivated in various locations and collected  from different areas of the plant. This strategyallowed to get a high variability of the  content of the cannabinoids CBDV, Δ9-THCV, CBC, CBD, Δ8-THC, Δ9-THC, CBG  and CBN (Table 1). In fact, there are samples with concentrations up to 12.93 % CBD  and 22.14 % Δ9-THC.  
The uniform distribution on the chemical measurements was described as the  ideal to get robust calibrations by Williams [41], instead of a Gaussian distribution, as  all the values are equally represented in the calibration set. Hence, the effect by which  the results of future analyses show to regress towards the mean will be avoided. The  histograms of frequencies showed in general a continuous distribution of the reference  values across the concentration intervals (Figure 1). Although the distribution of  samples was not uniform, the continuous presence of samples between minimum and  maximum values, and not having a Gaussian distribution was considered a positive feature of the calibration set, as the models will not show the results of future analyses  to regress towards the mean [41]. 
In addition, the procedure followed to split the sample set into calibration and  validation sets, which consisted of sorting one every 3rd sample from the collective  ordered upon the GH value for the validation set, allowed to select samples from all the  cultivars and crop fields in a similar proportion (30%), thus providing a validation set 
with similar chemical characteristics in both the calibration and validation sets (Table  1).   
The standard error of laboratory (SEL) was calculated for each parameter to  measure the prediction of the method (Table 1). The comparison of these values with  the NIR calibration and validation errors was used to evaluate the performance of the  models for the cannabinoid prediction in each instrument.  
3.2. Spectral features and population structure 
The spectra of the sample set of the Cannabis plants are shown in Figure 2. Figure  2A corresponds to spectra collected in the FNS scanning spectrometer provided with  two detectors (400-1098 nm and 1100-2500 nm). Therefore, visible region is also  recorded with instrument. The slight discrepancies observed in the visible region (400– 
750 nm) among spectra can be attributed to the colour, resembling different intensities  of green and ochre of the samples. With respect to the spectra collected in the FT-NIR  instrument (Figure 2B), absorbance values were recorded in the wavenumber  frequencies between 12500 and 4000 cm-1(780-2500 nm), so the visible region is not  included in the spectra. Besides, the region between 12500 and 9400 cm-1does not  contain information of interest in the FT-NIR spectra, so it was not used for calibration  development. 
Absorption bands typical of plant material appear in all the spectra and in both  instruments in the NIR region from 1100-2500 nm, being the absorbance differences  among spectra due to changes in their chemical composition. Bands at 1450 and 1930  nm, corresponding to the first overtone and combination bands of the -OH group,  mostly present in water, can be found in the spectra. Although samples had been oven 
dried, probably, residual water from samples handling was responsible for them. Bands  associated with lipids were found around 1210 nm (second overtone of stretching  vibrations), 1730 and 1760 nm (first overtone of stretching vibrations), and around 2310  and 2350 nm (combination of stretching and bending vibrations) of -CH2 and -CH3 
functional groups. Bands associated at 2058 and 2166 nm have been associated with  absorption of protein, and around 2078–2110 nm and 2268 nm are related to fibre  content, as reported by Williams [41]. 
Besides, the absorbance band found at 1666 nm corresponds to aromatic  hydrocarbons of the Cannabis terpenes (first overtone of CH-stretching). This band is  more evident in samples having contents of CBD above 4%. 
As for the population structure, the PCA applied to determine the structure the spectral variability of the population [35] allowed the detection of two samples as  outliers (GH value > 3), which were removed. From the remaining 187 samples, every  third sample was selected for the validation set (56 samples), and the rest remained as  the calibration set (131 samples). Figure 3 shows the score plot of the three first  principal components (PCs) of the calibration set (crosses) and the overplot of the  validation samples spectra (squares). The structured selection of samples for validation,  upon the spectral information, allowed obtaining a validation set homogeneously  distributed in the population, as well as with similar chemical composition (Table 1). 
3.3. Calibration development 
In this work, the same calibration and validation sets (131 and 56 samples,  respectively), resulting from the population structuring process, were used for the  development and validation of the predictive models in both instruments using their  respective chemometric software. 
3.3.1. Dispersive NIR spectrometer 
The WinISI IV software package was used for the chemometric management of  data. Separate MPLS calibrations were performed for each parameter, using the  calibration set (131 samples). The combination of four spectral derivative math  treatments (1, 5, 5, 1; 1, 10, 10, 1; 2, 5, 5, 1 and 2, 10, 10, 1), and two scatter correction  algorithms (SNV and DT, and MSC) in three spectral regions (400–2500; 1100–2500  and 800–2500 nm) provided 24 equations for the prediction of each cannabinoid.  Several statistics (SEC, R2, SECV and R2CV), describing the performance of the  calibration, were provided by the software. The predictive ability of the equations was  assessed by applying these equations to the external validation set (56 samples). SEP  values, together with the slope and RSQ resulting from the comparison of lab versus predicted data, were obtained. The selection of the best calibrations was based on the  higher R2CV and RPD values and lower SECV and SEP (Table 2).
The visible spectral range did not provide relevant information to improve the  results, as none of the selected equations used the complete spectral range from 400- 2500 nm. In general, better results were obtained using a second derivative treatment,  and only Δ8-THC, Δ9-THC and CBG equations use the first derivative pre-treatment of  the data. With respect to the scatter correction, the combination of SNV and DT pre treatments showed to provide improved results in all the cannabinoids except Δ9-THCV  and Δ9-THC. For these parameters, MSC scatter correction presented enhanced results. 
The number of PLS terms of the selected models varied between 7 for CBN and  12 for CBDV and Δ9-THCV parameters.  
Different criteria have been proposed for the evaluation of the best models  selected for each parameter in each instrument and for the comparison of results. Williams [42] indicated that calibration models having a value for R2above 0.91 are  considered to be excellent, and good prediction if R2is between 0.82 and 0.90. A value  for R2between 0.66 and 0.81 indicates approximate quantitative predictions, whereas,  values of R2between 0.50 and 0.65 indicates that more than 50% of the variance in Y is  accounted for variance X, so that discrimination between high and low concentrations  can be made The R2CV values of the selected models obtained with the dispersive  instrument NIR Systems 6500 scanning monocromator (Table 2) were higher than 0.91  (from 0.91 to 0.99), thus showing to be excellent, for the prediction of CBD, CBC, Δ8- THC, Δ9-THC, CBG and CBN, and good for CBDV and Δ9-THCV cannabinoids (R2CV values of 0.89 and 0.83, respectively), according to Williams [42]. 
With respect to the comparison of SECV with SEL values, Shenk and Westerhaus  [37] proposed the following criteria: SEP values 1 to 1.5 times SEL show excellent  precision; good precision if SEP is 2 to 3 times SEL, moderate precision if SEP is 4 to 5  times SEL, whereas models with SEP values above 5 times SEL of the reference  method are considered to have poor precision. According to this rule, the comparison of  SEL and SEP in this work show that CBG model has an excellent precision, Δ8-THC,  Δ9-THC, CBD and CBC have good precision, and Δ9-THCV moderate precision. Only  SEP values of CBDV are over 5 times SEL (Tables 1 and 2).  
RPD is a non-dimensional statistic for the quick assessment of a NIR  spectroscopy calibration model, as it enables the evaluation of a SECV or SEP in terms  of the standard deviation (SD) of the reference data. Williams [43] graded NIR 
applications in forages, feeds and soils according to their RPD values, indicating that  values from 2.5 to 2.9 are considered fair, and appropriate for screening purposes, from  3 to 3.4 can be considered as good for quality control, above 3.5 suitable for process  control, and excellent those above 4.1. Calibrations with RPD values below 2 are  considered to be poor, and not recommended. According to this statistic, the models to  predict CBG and Δ9-THCV are not yet suitable to be used (RPD 1.25 and 1.84,  respectively), whereas CBN, Δ8-THC, and CBDV models can be considered fair, and  appropriate for screening purposes. The models for Δ9-THC, CBC and CBD can be  evaluated as good, very good and excellent (RPD values 3.07, 3.79 and 6.03,  respectively), as they have enough accuracy to be used in routine analysis (Table 2). 
As for the validation results (Table 2; Figure 4A), after the application of the  selected models to the validation set, in general, SEP values are similar to SECV and  slope and RSQ are close to or above 0.9 in all parameters except CBG and CBN, which  results are less accurate. Additionally, paired t-test showed no significant differences  between reference and NIR predicted values in the validation set (p > 0.05), thus  confirming the reliability of the NIR technology for the measurement of the  cannabinoids in the dispersive instrument. 
3.3.2. FT-NIR spectrometer 
The PLS-1 algorithm included in the Quant2 module of the OPUS 7.2 software  package was used for the development of predictive calibration, using the same 131  samples as with the FNS 6500 instrument.  
For the model development, first and second derivative, first derivative combined  with vector normalization, and first derivative combined with MSC were used as  spectral pre-treatment of the data. Although second derivative showed better results in  most of the cannabinoids, the selected equation to predict Δ9-THC used first derivative,  as also did with the FOSS NIR Systems 6500. Unexpectedly, the use of algorithms to  correct the scatter effect provided better results only in the equations for the prediction  of CBN (MSC pre-treatment) and CBC (SNV pre-treatment). 
Despite the instrument collects data between 12500 – 4000 cm-1(800–2500 nm),  the region from 12500 to 9400 cm-1provides no relevant information (Figure 2B), so it  was not used for the calibration development. Hence, five frequency regions typical for  NIR applications were used to optimize the models: 9400 – 7500, 7500 –6100, 6100 –
5450, 5450 – 4600 and 4600 – 4250 cm-1. None of the selected equations showed to use  the complete wavelength region, and there was not a specific spectral region used for  the prediction of all the cannabinoids (Figure 5). However, 6100 – 5450 cm-1(1639 – 1835 nm) spectral region, which includes the band linked to terpenes absorbance, has  been included in all the models except CBG, probably due to the fact that the molecular  structure of this particular cannabinoid differs from the rest. 
According to Williams [42], the selected models obtained with the FT-NIR  instrument showed to be excellent for the prediction of all cannabinoids (R2CV values  from 0.93 to 0.99), except CBDV and Δ9-THCV (R2CV values of 0.81 and 0.77,  respectively), which can be considered of good precision (Table 3). The comparison of  SEL and SEP offer similar results as the ones obtained with the dispersive instrument,  and CBG has an excellent precision, Δ8-THC, Δ9-THC, CBD and CBC have good  precision, Δ9-THCV moderate precision, and SEP values of CBDV are over 5 times  SEL (Tables 1 and 3). According to RPD statistic, the CBN model, together with the  ones to predict CBG and Δ9-THCV, are not yet suitable to be used, whereas, Δ8-THC,  and CBDV models can be considered appropriate for screening purposes. The models  for Δ9-THC, CBC and CBD can be evaluated as good, very good and excellent as their  RPD values exceed 3, and reach a value of 6, for the latter one (Table 3). 
External validation shows similar results to those obtained with the dispersive  instrument (Table 3; Figure 4B), after the application of the selected models to the  validation set. Likewise, paired t-test showed no significant differences (p > 0.05)  between cannabinoids reference and NIR predicted values after applying the models  developed in the FT-NIR instrument to the validation set. 
The calibration and validation statistics obtained in both instruments, using the  same calibration and validation sets but their specific software, are comparable (Tables  2 and 3). Similarly, the plots of measured values (X axis) versus predicted (Y axis) of  cannabinoids of the validation data set (Figure 4A,B) show analogous results, and the  same samples with higher residual values of each parameter can be found in both  instruments. However, it is noticeable that the models obtained with the FT-NIR  instrument tend to eliminate a higher number of samples along the calibration process,  and not to use scatter correction pre-treatment to get the better performance results. 
NIR has been used in Cannabis for qualitative purposes (discrimination between  Δ9-THC-rich and hemp [29], and discrimination of Cannabis leaves and canopies from  other plant species [30]), but no previous reports on the development of predictive  models with samples of chemotypes different than I, II, and III have been found in our  bibliographic research, so it was not possible to contrast the results obtained here. With  respect to other active pharmaceutical parameters, similar statistics have been reported  on NIR prediction of alkaloids in Papaver somniferum [44] and in perennial ryegrass  [45] or phenolic compounds in plants [46].  
4. Conclusions 
The methodology of quantitative determination of cannabinoids in Cannabis raw  materials has been developed using near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and Fourier Transform Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-NIR) for the first time. This new analytical  method would allow a simpler, a more robust and precise estimation than the current  standard GC. The results obtained allow to confirm that there is sufficient information  in the NIRS spectral region for the development of cannabinoid prediction models in  dried and ground Cannabis plant materials. Hence, the NIR technique has been proven  as an alternative method to the conventional GC analysis for the assessment of  Cannabis sativa L. varieties and genetic resources as regard to their cannabinoids  contents. The major advantage of such spectroscopic technique is that the sample is  measured with no or little pre-treatment (e.g. grinding, drying), is faster, simpler, and  uses no pollutants for the environment compared with the reference analytical method. The comparison of the predictive ability of the models obtained with the dispersive NIR  and the FT-NIR spectrometers show no significant differences between them, although  pre-treatments for the scatter correction and derivatives, as well as the outlier detection  during the calibration process with the chemometric software were diverse.
