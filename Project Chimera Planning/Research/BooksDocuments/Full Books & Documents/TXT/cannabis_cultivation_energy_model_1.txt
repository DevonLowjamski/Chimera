ABSTRACT The recent legalization of cannabis is facilitating very rapid growth in the cannabis cultivation industry, with the energy intensive indoor cultivation facilities becoming more prevalent. This presents a challenge to utilities as the high energy demand from this industry can overburden the existing utility infrastructure. Hence, from both planning and operational perspectives, it is crucial to understand the energy consumption of the rapidly growing load. This paper proposes a deterministic energy consumption model for indoor cannabis cultivation operations for the two major loads in these facilities, i.e., lighting and HVAC, over a 24-hour period based on equipment specifications and operational requirements of the facility. This model can further be used to estimate or forecast short-term and long-term energy demands and costs of indoor cannabis operation(s). The proposed model successfully simulated the environmental conditions in a real world cannabis facility, and the model’s energy consumption output is validated using actual measurements taken from this facility as well as model output using GridLab-D.

I. INTRODUCTION 
CANNABIS cultivation is an energy-intensive sector and 
with the recent legalization of this industry, such as in 
Canada and a growing number of US states, the cannabis sec 
tor is growing very rapidly and consequently, so is the energy 
demand. For example, in 2014, Denver saw a 1.2% increase 
in electricity use, and 45% of that increase in demand came 
from cannabis cultivation, i.e., 0.54% of Denver’s electricity 
use [1]. In 2018, 4% of Denver’s electricity usage is attributed 
to the cannabis industry. In California, indoor Cannabis pro 
duction consumes 3% of California’s total electricity, and 1% 
of total US electricity [2]. While the demand from cannabis 
operations can help flatten the load profile during off-peak periods, it can also overburden existing utility infrastructure. Hence, from both planning and operational perspectives, it is important for the system operators and utilities to understand this load’s energy consumption. 
The energy consumption from the grid required for cannabis cultivation facilities is dependent on several fac tors such as, facility type, lighting fixtures used, and HVAC (temperature and humidity) settings and efficiencies. Facility type has an impact on the energy consumed for cannabis

cultivation due to differences in the involved processes [3]. While outdoor cannabis cultivation is far less energy inten sive than indoor operations, many choose to grow cannabis indoors or in greenhouses to boost productivity and lower risk to yields resulting from unpredictable and/or extreme weather conditions.

greenhouse, and indoor cultivation operations. While lighting in greenhouses supplement natural sunlight, in indoor oper ations, lighting loads are much higher because high power lights are used to replace sunlight. In turn, these high-power lights in indoor operations generate significant heat, which needs a high capacity HVAC system to maintain optimal growing conditions for cannabis plants. These reasons sup port the need for a different model for indoor grow facilities. 
In legal markets, indoor and greenhouse cultivation is more prevalent [3]. In 2017, approximately 60% of elec tricity usage in legal cannabis cultivation in the US was associated with indoor operations, while 37% was associated with greenhouse production [3]. The total energy costs for indoor cannabis grow operations typically varies between 20%-50% of total operating costs (approximately 150 kWh of electricity/yr/sq.ft). In comparison, energy use in a medium size or larger brewery accounts for about 6-12% of total operating costs [4]. 
Cannabis cultivation requires three stages: the seedling (or propagation) stage, the vegetative stage, and the flowering stage, all of which have different energy requirements based on the lighting, temperature, and humidity level they need. Typically, for indoor and greenhouse operations, the flow ering stage has the highest energy consumption, while the seedling stage has the lowest [3]. Fig. 2 shows the electricity use breakdown for a typical indoor cannabis grow operation which shows that most of the electricity consumed is due to HVAC (ventilation, air conditioning, and dehumidification) (51%) and lighting (38%) [2]. In comparison, electricity rep resents only 10-15% of a typical greenhouse grower’s total energy consumption [5]. 
FIGURE 2. Electricity use breakdown for a typical indoor cannabis cultivation operation. 
There are limited works in the literature that address energy management and consumption in greenhouses using math ematical models, such as [6]–[9], while others present an overview of the energy use of the new, emerging energy intensive cannabis industry [1], [3], [4], [10]. In [11], the tech nical report presents estimates and forecasts of energy con sumption by indoor cannabis facilities in Ontario; however, the load profile considered for an indoor cannabis facility was assumed to be the same as an greenhouse cannabis facility. This assumption may underestimate the energy con sumption of an indoor cannabis facility, based on the field data presented in [3]. To the best of our knowledge, there 
are no works to date proposing energy consumption models targeting cannabis grow operations in particular. In view of the above discussions, this paper focuses on developing a deterministic energy consumption model for indoor cannabis cultivation facilities accounting for the two major energy loads, i.e., lighting and HVACs. This paper makes a number of contributions. Firstly, an energy con sumption model for indoor cannabis facilities is developed and presented, considering the scheduling and operational requirements of lighting and HVAC equipment, respectively. Secondly, the proposed energy consumption model computes the daily peak demand, 24-hr power profile for each stage and entire facility, and the daily cost of electricity used by the facility based on time-of-use (TOU) rates for a real-world indoor cannabis facility demonstrating the capability of the model. Finally, temperature control in each grow room is modeled based on the energy balance equation considering sensible (lighting) and latent (evapotranspiration) heat con tributions as well as the ventilation, conduction, convection, and infiltration losses. Furthermore, humidity control in each grow room is modeled based on the mass balance equa tion considering evapotranspiration, ventilation, and infiltra tion contributions as well as the moisture removed through dehumidification. 
The proposed energy consumption model can be used by power system planners and operators to estimate/forecast long-term energy demands posed by indoor operations of this emerging industry, and maintain the security and reliability of the overall system. Utilities can also use this model to esti mate short-term energy demands from their existing/future customers, identify limitations posed by the grid, and design specific strategies targeting cannabis grow operations to par ticipate in demand response programs as well as offer incen tives to achieve higher energy efficiency. Cannabis facility owners can use this energy consumption model to better understand the current energy consumption in their facility as well as the cost of consumed electricity; future upgrades to improve the energy efficiency of their facility (e.g., HPS to LED lights) can be evaluated as well. 
The objective of the energy consumption model is to deter mine the daily energy consumed by a given indoor cannabis facility to maintain the grow rooms within the specified temperature and relative humidity thresholds, based on the physical parameters of the grow rooms, lighting and hvac equipment specifications, and operational requirements. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The lighting and environmental requirements for the different stages of cannabis cultivation are discussed in Section II. The developed energy consumption model is presented and discussed in Section III. The parameters of the real-world indoor cannabis cultivation facility and simulation results of the proposed model’s application to this real-world facility are presented and discussed in Section IV. Finally, the main conclusions and contributions of this paper are highlighted in Section V.

II. STAGES OF CANNABIS CULTIVATION 
The lighting and environmental requirements for the different stages of cannabis cultivation are shown in Fig. 3. The initial phase of cannabis cultivation is the process of replicating a genetic strain, typically done through cloning from living stock, known as the seedling or propagation stage. This stage of the cultivation generally represents less than 5% of overall electricity use [3]. Clone plants are generally kept under lower-wattage lights (5-40 W/sq.ft.) 18-24 hours a day for 1-2 weeks. T5HO fluorescents are preferred for this stage. Optimal temperature and relative humidity levels for cannabis cultivation are 24−26◦C and 70-75% relative humidity [12]. Generally, split air-conditioning units are sufficient for this stage. 
In the next stage, known as the vegetative stage, the clones are transplanted to an area that has higher intensity light and different environmental conditions. This stage con sumes approximately 30-40% of total electricity use [3]. Historically, High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) lights and Metal Halide (MH) lamps were preferred for the vegetative state, though now, LEDs and CMH fixtures are seeing increased adoption. Depending on strain and grower preference, plants remain in this stage for about 2-3 weeks (indoor culti vation) or 4-6 weeks (greenhouse cultivation) with lights (15-70 W/sq.ft.) on for generally 18 hours a day [3]. 
lighting. 1000 W HPS fixtures are conventionally used for this stage because of their concentration of yellow or red spectra. Optimal temperature and relative humidity levels for cannabis cultivation are 24 − 26◦C and 60-65% relative humidity [12]. Generally, rooftop units and standalone dehu midifiers are used in this stage for temperature and humidity control. 
III. PROPOSED ENERGY CONSUMPTION MODEL In a typical indoor cannabis cultivation facility, the total energy consumption results from these energy consuming loads - supplementary lighting, climate control of tempera ture, relative humidity, and CO2 levels, air ventilation and circulation, space heating, drying, and irrigation systems. The energy demand of these loads varies with different stages of cannabis cultivation. 
A. ASSUMPTIONS 
In the proposed energy consumption model, only electric ity consumption due to lighting, ventilation, and HVAC (temperature and humidity control) in the each of the stages are considered. It is also assumed that the installed HVAC equipment for temperature and humidity control are sized appropriately for the facility. The grow rooms are assumed to be well-sealed and well-insulated to minimize leakage of thermal energy and moisture. The temperature and relative humidity in the rooms during each computation interval are assumed to be constant, as the intervals are in the order of 1-5 minutes. The cooling and heating capacities as well as the air flow rates for the HVAC and dehumidifiers are assumed to be continuous variables in this model. 
B. DESCRIPTION OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION MODEL The model computes the power demand and energy consumed due to lighting, air circulation, and HVAC (temperature and humidity control) in each room r ∈ Nr and cultivation stage s ∈ S in time step dt over a given time horizon t ∈ T as follows:

The change in humidity ratio in a given time interval t can be expressed as:

Saturation vapour pres sure at a given temperature K (in Kelvin) is given by [13]: 
where Mdis the molar mass of dry air (=0.028964 kg/mol), Mvis the molar mass of water vapour (=0.018016 kg/mol), R is the universal gas constant (=8.314 J/K.mol), and Kt,r,sis the temperature (in Kelvin) of grow room r in stage s in time interval t.

stage sin the current time interval t, the humidity ratio in time interval t +1 is computed using (13). To compute the change in humidity ratio for any time interval t in (12), the different

contributions are computed as follows. Water vapour added by plant evapotranspiration is computed using: 
M˙trans 
t,r,s = Ftrans 
s· nplants 
r,s· FLt,r,s(15) 
where Ftrans 
sis the transpiration rate per plant in stage s (kgwater/hr), nplants 
r,sis the number of plants in room r and stage s, and FLt,r,sis the light factor. When the lights are on, it causes the plants to transpire more (FLt,r,s = 1); however, when the lights are off, the plants still transpire at a lower rate (FLt,r,s = 0.3) [15]. For the proposed energy consumption model, the transpiration rate is assumed to be 0.25 kg/plant/hr in the seedling/propagation stage, 0.38 kg/plant/hr in the vegetative stage, and 0.5 kg/plant/hr in the flowering stage [16]. 
Water vapour added due to grow room ventilation is computed using: 
t,r,s· ωOt = ψvent· V˙hvac 
computed using: 
ω0t+1,r,s =1ω0t,r,s 
ρt,r,s· Vr,s+ ωt,r,s (20) 
If the dehumidifier(s) in room r and stage s is ON in the time interval t and the humidity ratio exceeds the upper limit (ω0t+1,r,s − ¯ω > 0), then the dehumidifier air flow rate V˙ Dt,r,s can be computed using: 
ω0t+1,r,s − ¯ω =V˙ Dt,r,s· ρt,r,s· ωt,r,s 
ρ0t,r,s· Vr,s(21) 
If the computed dehumidifier air flow rate V˙ Dt,r,sexceeds the rated dehumidifier air flow rate (V˙ D,rated 
r,s), then the dehumid ifier air flow rate is set to V˙ D,rated 
r,s. Therefore, the power con sumption by dehumidification units PDt,r,sin each room and stage is computed in proportion to the computed dehumidifier air flow rate as follows: 
M˙vent 
t,r,s· ρOt · ωOt(16)

r,sis the aggregate rated power of the dehumidi fier(s) in room r and stage s. The power consumption by dehumidifiers in each stage s, PDt,s, and time interval t, PDt, is computed as follows:

where V˙inf 
M˙inf 
PDt,s =X Nr 
PDt,r,s(23) 
t,r,sis the air infiltration flow rate (m3/hr) and ρHtis the air density of hallway air (kg/m3) computed using (14), 
PDt =X S 
PDt,s(24) 
which uses partial pressure and temperature of the hallway. The infiltration of air into the grow room from the hallway occurs due to the pressure difference between these zones when the door opens. The air infiltration rates used are differ ent for peak and off-peak times, similar to a warehouse [17]. Water vapour removed through dehumidification is computed using: 
M˙ Dt,r,s· ωt,r,s = αDt,r,s· nDr,s· V˙ Dt,r,s· ρt,r,s · ωt,r,s (18) 
where αDt,r,sis the state of dehumidifier operation based on the relative humidity setting of dehumidifier in room r and stage s (=1, ∀ φt,r,s > φset

of dehumidification units in room r and stage s, V˙ Dt,r,sis the air flow rate of the dehumidification unit (m3/hr), and ρt,r,s is the humid air density inside room r and stage s (kg/m3). 
It is important to note that the dehumidification require ment depends on the relative humidity level in the room. Hence, to compute the dehumidifier air flow rate V˙ Dt,r,sfor the time interval t in room r and stage s, the change in humidity ratio without dehumidification 1ω0t,r,sfor the same is computed using:

4) TEMPERATURE CONTROL 
Cannabis operations monitor and control the temperature inside grow rooms within a specific range to promote optimal growth of plants. In the proposed energy consumption model, temperature in grow rooms is simulated using the energy balance equation, which accounts for the thermal energy added and lost in a room over a time interval [14]. This energy balance equation considers thermal energy contribu tions through HVAC, sensible heat (thermal energy added due to supplemental lighting), latent heat (thermal energy added due to plant evapotranspiration) as well as thermal energy lost/removed through conduction and convection, ventilation, and door opening events. Hence, the steady-state energy bal ance equation in each time interval t is represented for each room r and stage s, as follows: 
1ω0t,r,s = M˙trans

The lighting schedule in the grow rooms are staggered to lower the daily peak demand as follows: 6:00 am - 12:00 am (Seedling and flowering room 1); 2:00 am - 8:00 pm (veg etative room); 12:00 pm - 12:00 am (flowering room 2); and 12:00 am - 12:00 pm (flowering room 3).

the temperature and RH regulation. It can be seen that the HVAC in the grow room keeps the room temperature within the specified limits. Similarly, the dehumidifier in the grow room regulates the relative humidity based on a maximum RH setting. Furthermore, Fig. 5 shows a breakdown of thermal energy and moisture contributions from different sources. It can be seen that the largest source of thermal energy is the lighting in the room, while plant evapotranspiration is the largest contributor of moisture inside the room. In this facility, thermal energy loss through conduction/convection (heat loss), ventilation, and infiltration are not significant. This may be because of the well-sealed and heavily insulated grow rooms and minimal temperature difference between the hallway and grow room. 
2) POWER DEMAND PROFILE 
For the given day, the peak power demand for the entire facility is computed to be 237.1 kW. The power demand profile for lighting, HVAC, and dehumidification loads in different stages of cannabis cultivation are shown in Fig. 6. In this figure, it can be seen that the flowering stage has the highest power consumption of the three stages, while 
FIGURE 6. Power demand profiles for lighting, HVAC, and dehumidification loads in different stages in a real world indoor cannabis facility. 
FIGURE 7. Operation state and power consumed by lighting, HVAC, and dehumidifier in a grow room (flowering stage). 
propagation stage has the lowest. Furthermore, HVAC and dehumidification power consumption is less than lighting loads, which may be attributed to the well-insulated and well-sealed grow rooms reducing the leakage of cool air through conduction, resulting in higher HVAC efficiency. Fig. 7 presents the operation state and power consumed by 
VOLUME 7, 2020 229
lighting, HVAC, and dehumidifier in a flowering stage grow room. It can be seen that the HVAC cooling and dehumidi fication loads are the highest when the lights are on. This is because the heat emitted by the lights increases transpiration of water from the plants. 
3) ENERGY CONSUMPTION PROFILE 
The 15-min average energy consumption profiles for each cultivation stage in the facility is shown in Fig. 8, which is computed using the energy consumption of lighting, HVAC, and dehumidification loads in each stage. The profiles follow a similar trend as the power demand profiles. It is important to note that the determination of the power profiles and the total energy consumed by the facility only considers the lighting, HVAC, and dehumidification loads; other loads have not been considered but may be estimated based on the percentages given in Fig. 2. The breakdown of the total energy consumed by the facility by load and stage for a 24-hour period is shown in Table 2. The results show that the contribution of lighting, HVAC, and dehumidification towards the total energy con sumption is 66.14%, 33.83%, and 0.03%, respectively. 
FIGURE 8. Energy profile of the facility in 15-min intervals. 
TABLE 2. Energy Consumption by Indoor Cannabis Facility for a 24-h period (kWh). 
4) ELECTRICITY COST 
Based on the computed energy consumption for the facility, the cost of consumed electricity is computed using TOU rates (current pricing plan for facility) and the results are presented in Table 3. 
5) ELECTRICITY INTENSITY 
This is a commonly used benchmark by cannabis facil ity owners to measure their facility’s electricity consump tion per unit of flowering canopy area, and is measured

FIGURE 9. Comparing the power demand profile of the model with the real-world facility and GridLab-D. 
in kWh/sq.ft. For this facility, with a flowering canopy area of approximately 4000 sq.ft. and 24-hour total energy con sumption of 4942 kWh, the electricity intensity for this facil ity is computed to be 1.24 kWh/sq.ft/day. 
C. MODEL VALIDATION 
In order to validate the proposed model, the one-day power demand profile generated by the model, as shown in Fig. 9, is compared with: 1) the power demand profile col lected from the real-world indoor cannabis growing facility; 2) a simulation of the facility’s demand produced using GridLab-D [24] simulation software. 
1) VALIDATION USING ACTUAL MEASUREMENTS FROM A REAL-WORLD FACILITY 
Actual measurements from a real-world indoor cannabis cultivation facility data are used to validate the proposed model. The facility meets certain optimal conditions for indoor cannabis cultivation, such as well-sealed and heavily insulated grow rooms, climate and lighting control in grow rooms, blocking out windows in grow rooms, and so on. The parameters of one growing room in the vegetative stage in that facility are provided in Table 4 in the Appendix. Voltage, current, and phase angle measurements at the grow room panel were collected using Braingrid [25] sensor devices. 
230 VOLUME 7, 2020
Mehboob et al.: Energy Consumption Model for Indoor Cannabis Cultivation Facility 
The cultivation at the cannabis facility was in the infancy stage at the time of model development, and the cannabis plants were still in the vegetative stage then. Hence, this comparison is for the power demand of the vegetative stage only, that is Grow Room 2. 
2) VALIDATION USING GridLab-D 
The model of the cannabis facility was built using GridLab-D [24]. In this model, grow rooms are modeled sep arately using the residential house model the has no windows and very good insulation level. The facility’s grow rooms parameters are used as inputs to their counterparts in the model such as the floor area, the ceiling height, and the door size. However, the aggregate size of the HVAC units and fans is used in the model since the software does not model multiple units. The other model parameters such as the power requirements and the number of lighting fixtures, lighting schedules, and heating and cooling setpoints are set according to the facility’s data given in Table 4. Finally, all the simulations are run using the outside temperature and relative humidity values as measured at the real-world facility. 
The comparison in Fig. 9 shows the lighting power con sumption, HVAC power consumption, and total power con sumption profiles. From the figure, it can be seen that the output generated by the proposed model is closer to the actual measurements, compared to the GridLab-D results. The results show that the proposed model is able to estimate the lighting load with an average error of −0.6% when com pared to the actual facility measurements; however, in the case of HVAC load, the average error is higher at +1.2%. This can be attributed to deviation of real-world conditions from assumptions made in the proposed model, with respect to entry and exit frequency in the room as well as the number of plants in the room on the given day. If the actual entry and exit frequency or the actual number of plants in the grow room on the chosen day are significantly higher than the model assumptions, HVAC power consumption will be higher due to increased temperature and humidity fluctuation resulting from opening and closing of doors and increased evapotranspiration, respectively. 
3) LIMITATIONS OF THE PROPOSED MODEL 
The error in the model output can be attributed to the follow ing limitations of the model: 
• Due to the diversity of HVAC equipment utilized by indoor cannabis cultivators, it is impossible to model the HVAC equipment exactly for each individual facility. Hence, some error is introduced into the model because the model is based on heating/cooling functions of the HVAC and applied in the energy and moisture balance equations. 
• This model assumes 80% efficiency for the HVAC equipment, as this information was not available in the 
manufacturer datasheets. Hence, if the actual HVAC efficiency is different from the assumed efficiency, this would introduce an error. Furthermore, in longer estab lished indoor cannabis operations, the HVAC equipment efficiency can vary based on the age of the equip ment, technology, and regularity of maintenance. This is another factor that can introduce errors in the output of this model. 
• In this model, the transpiration rates for cannabis plants in each stage are assumed to be a constant with a unit of kg/hour/plant. In reality, the transpiration rate of cannabis plants (or evapotranspiration) can vary as temperature and relative humidity conditions at the leaf surface and the resulting vapour pressure deficit changes [26], [27]. The higher the temperature in the room, the more the plants transpire; the model uses different transpiration constants for when the lights are on and off. Hence, for the purpose of this model, the con stants [16] are sufficient; however, if the actual evap otranspiration rates are significantly different from the assumed rates, this would introduce an error in the model output. 
• The lag times in heating and cooling of the room when the lights turn on and off, respectively, are not considered in this model. However, it can be seen in the HVAC power consumption profiles plotted using measurements that the lag times do not have a significant impact on the power consumption profile, as the measurement vs model output plots are very close in pattern. 
• The number of plants in any grow room may change on a day-to-day basis. However, to estimate the energy con sumption of the facility in the proposed model, the max imum plant capacity of grow rooms is used. 
V. CONCLUSION 
The proposed deterministic energy consumption model used the energy and mass balance equations to simulate tempera ture and humidity control, respectively, in the grow rooms. Based on the temperature and humidity simulations and operational requirements of the facility, the proposed model computed the total energy consumption and electricity cost of the facility, as well as for each room and cultivation stage of the indoor cannabis operation. In addition, power profiles were computed for each room, stage, and entire facility, based on the physical parameters of the grow rooms, equipment specifications, and operational requirements. The proposed model also computed the cost of electricity used by the real-world facility. The results of the proposed energy consumption model, applied to a real-world indoor cannabis facility, show that lighting is the highest energy consuming load, and of the three cannabis cultivation stages, flowering has the highest energy consumption. The proposed model was validated using actual power consumption measurements from the real-world facility as well as GridLab-D simulation software.
