Abstract: Damping-off, crown rot, and root rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum and Pythium spp. are important diseases that reduce the  growth of cannabis plants and cause mortality. There are currently limited management options available to producers in the absence of  registered chemical fungicides. The comparative efficacy of five biological-control agents in reducing disease severity was evaluated in this  study. Rhapsody® ASO (Bacillus subtilis), Stargus® (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens), Lalstop® (Gliocladium catenulatum, Prestop®),  RootShield® Plus WP (Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma virens), and Asperello® (Trichoderma asperellum) were applied to  cannabis cuttings in rockwool blocks followed 48 hr later by inoculation with a F. oxysporum spore and mycelial suspension. Disease was  rated 7, 14 and 21 days post-inoculation. The most effective treatments were Lalstop, Rootshield, Asperello and Stargus, which provided  a significant (P < 0.05) reduction (30 to 56.3%) in mean disease severity 14 days post-inoculation compared to the Fusarium inoculated  control. Application of Rootshield, Asperello and Lalstop resulted in endophytic colonization of cannabis cuttings when assessed after 2 and  7 days. For Pythium biocontrol, Rootshield Plus WP, Asperello, and Lalstop were applied as a drench to rooted plants 7 days before  inoculation with P. myriotylum. Based on disease severity ratings and plant measurements in two experiments, the most effective treatments  were Rootshield and Lalstop. Plants receiving Lalstop or Rootshield had significantly (P < 0.05) higher fresh root weights compared to the  pathogen only treatment. These results indicate that several biological control agents can protect cannabis plants from infection by Fusarium  and Pythium spp. through pre-emptive colonization.

Résumé: La fonte des semis et la pourriture du collet et des racines, causées par Fusarium oxysporum et Pythium spp., sont de graves  maladies qui réduisent la croissance des plants de cannabis et entraînent la mort. Actuellement, il y a peu d’options de gestion offertes aux  producteurs en l’absence de fongicides de synthèse homologués. Au cours de cette étude, l’efficacité comparée de cinq agents de lutte  biologique quant à la réduction de la gravité de la maladie a été évaluée. RhapsodyMD ASO (Bacillus subtilis), StargusMD (Bacillus  amyloliquefaciens), LalstopMD (Gliocladium catenulatum, PrestopMD), RootShieldMD Plus WP (Trichoderma harzianum et Trichoderma  virens) et AsperelloMD (Trichoderma asperellum) ont été appliqués sur des boutures de cannabis plantées dans des blocs de laine de roche  qui, 48 heures plus tard, ont été inoculées avec une suspension de spores et de mycélium de F. oxysporum. La maladie a été évaluée à 7, 14 et  21 jours après l’inoculation. Les traitements les plus efficaces ont été Lalstop, Rootshield, Asperello et Stargus qui ont réduit (de 30 à 56,3%)  significativement (P < 0,05) la gravité moyenne de la maladie 14 jours après l’inoculation, comparativement au témoin inoculé avec  Fusarium. L’application de Rootshield, d’Asperello et de Lalstop avait occasionné la colonization endophyte des boutures de cannabis  lorsqu’elles ont été évaluées au bout de 2 et 7 jours. Quant à la lutte biologique contre Pythium, Rootshield Plus WP, Asperello et Lalstop ont  été appliqués par mouillage des plants enracinés 7 jours avant l’inoculation avec P. myriotylum. En se basant sur les cotes de gravité de la  maladie et le mesurage des plants au cours de deux expériences, Rootshield et Lalstop se sont avérés les plus efficaces. Le poids des racines  fraîches des plants traités avec Lalstop ou Rootshield était significativement (P < 0,05) plus élevé comparativement au témoin traité

the target pathogen and intrinsic factors of the biocontrol  
Introduction 
Root rot, crown rot and damping off diseases caused by  species of Fusarium and Pythium affect numerous crops  throughout the world (Agrios 2005). Cannabis  (Cannabis sativa L.) is reported to be affected by multi 
ple species of Fusarium and Pythium, including  F. oxysporum, F. solani, F. proliferatum, P. myriotylum,  P. dissotocum and P. aphanidermatum (Punja and  Rodriquez 2018; Punja et al. 2018, 2021; Punja 2020a,  2020b). These pathogens infect cannabis plants grown in  indoor environments as well as in greenhouses and in the  field. Symptoms of Fusarium infection on plants include  stunting, chlorosis, wilting, root rot and crown rot (Punja  2020a, 2020b). Fusarium spp. can also cause damping off on cannabis cuttings, characterized by symptoms of  soft, discoloured regions on stems (Punja 2020b).  Infections can advance rapidly, causing cuttings to col 
lapse and die. Pythium infection on cannabis plants  causes root and crown rot, stunting, chlorosis, wilting  and death (Punja and Rodriquez 2018; Punja et al. 2021).  These symptoms may be especially severe under condi 
tions of extreme heat, which can cause plants to rapidly  wilt and die, resulting in considerable losses for  producers. 
Current management practices for Fusarium and  Pythium species rely on cultural control methods, such  as avoiding overwatering, utilizing well draining grow ing media, sanitizing tools and equipment, and ensuring  plant materials and irrigation sources are free of patho gen inoculum. There are currently no chemical fungi cides currently registered by the Pest Management  Regulatory Agency in Canada to manage these patho gens (Health Canada 2022). However, several biological  control products are registered for management of root  and crown rot caused by Fusarium and Pythium. These  include products containing fungi such as Trichoderma  spp. (Rootshield®, Asperello T34 and Trianum),  Gliocladium catenulatum (Lalstop®) or actinobacteria  such as Streptomyces lydicus (Actinovate® SP) (Health  Canada 2022). No Bacillus spp. are currently registered  to manage either of these pathogens on cannabis. The  efficacy, growth and survival of biological control agents  are known to be affected by environmental factors (tem perature, moisture, nutrients), application timing (pre ventative vs. curative), the presence of other microbes,  
agent itself (Bae and Knudsen 2005; Bonaterra et al.  2007; Bardin et al. 2015; Fedele et al. 2019).  Therefore, an assessment of biocontrol efficacy requires  comparisons to be made under identical experimental  conditions. At the present time, data demonstrating the  comparative efficacy of these biological control products  to manage Fusarium and Pythium species infecting can 
nabis are lacking. 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effi cacy of five biological control products in reducing  infection of cuttings by F. oxysporum as well as root  rot caused by P. myriotylum on cannabis plants. These  products were Asperello (Trichoderma asperellum),  Rootshield Plus WP (Trichoderma harzianum and  Trichoderma virens), Lalstop (Gliocladium catenulatum,  Prestop) and Stargus (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens).  Rhapsody ASO (Bacillus subtilis) was also tested, but  only against F. oxysporum. The extent to which the  biocontrol agents colonized cuttings internally was also  studied to evaluate the endophytic capability of  Trichoderma spp. and G. catenulatum. 
Materials and methods 
Pathogen isolation 
Symptoms of damping-off on cuttings caused by  Fusarium spp. include chlorosis, wilting and soft and  discoloured stem tissues, resulting in collapse and  death. Mycelium may develop on the affected stems.  Symptoms on more mature plants include stunting, yel 
lowing and occasionally wilting (Punja 2020b). To  recover Fusarium from these tissues, affected cuttings  and roots were surface sterilized by immersing tissues in  a 10% bleach solution (Javex, containing 6.25% NaOCl)  for 30 sec followed by a 30 sec rinse in sterile distilled  water. Tissues were dried on sterile paper towels and  small segments were plated onto potato dextrose agar  containing streptomycin sulphate at 140 mg L−1 (PDA  +S). Petri dishes were incubated under ambient labora tory conditions (temperature range of 21–24°C with  fluorescent lighting) for 7–10 days and colonies resem 
bling Fusarium were transferred to fresh PDA+S. They  were identified based on the morphology of colonies and  spores, followed by PCR of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region  
C. Scott and Z. K. Punja 240
of rDNA as described by Punja (2020b). For recovery of  Pythium spp., root samples from plants with symptoms  of stunting, chlorosis and root and crown rot were sur face sterilized as described above and colonies resem bling Pythium spp. were subcultured and identified using  the ITS primers as described above. All cultures were  maintained on PDA+S. 
Inoculum production 
A mycelial plug of an isolate of F. oxysporum was  added to 100 mL of potato dextrose broth (PDB) in  a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask and cultures were shaken  at 150 rpm for 7 days under ambient laboratory con 
ditions. The contents of the flask were mixed with  autoclaved deionized water (1:1, v/v) and blended for  20 sec in a Waring blender. To determine the concen tration of F. oxysporum inoculum, serial dilutions were  made and plated onto PDA+S plates. After 5–7 days,  colonies of Fusarium were identified based on their  morphology and counted. Pythium inoculum was pro duced by growing cultures in 150 mL of half-strength  PDB in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks at 150 rpm for  7 days. Cultures were blended for 20 sec in  a Waring blender before use. To determine the con centration of P. myriotylum inoculum, serial dilutions  were made and plated onto PDA+S plates. After  3–5 days, colonies of Pythium were identified based  on their morphology and counted. 
Fusarium inoculation and disease assessment 
The cannabis strain ‘White Rhino’ was selected as it is  susceptible to Fusarium infection (Punja 2020b). Stock  plants maintained by a licenced producer were used as  a source of vegetative cuttings. These cuttings were  approximately 10–15 cm in height and were inserted  into 4 cm Grodan rockwool blocks arranged inside plas 
tic containers, with six cuttings randomly assigned to  each container. Treatments included Rootshield WP  
Plus, Asperello, Lalstop, Stargus and Rhapsody ASO  and were prepared as per the rates indicated in Table 1.  Treatments were assigned to groups of cuttings comple tely at random. Suspensions (500 mL) of each biocontrol  agent were added to the plastic containers and left for  30 min, after which the excess liquid was drained, and  containers were placed on a plastic tray and covered with  a dome to maintain high humidity. Controls received an  equal volume of sterile distilled water. The trays were  placed inside a growth chamber (Conviron Adaptis,  Winnipeg, MB) set at 24°C under a 24-hr photoperiod  provided by 24 watt 6400 k T5HO lamps (Sunblaster,  Langley, BC) for 48-hr. After this period, Fusarium  inoculum was applied with a pipette to deliver 2 mL at  the base of each cutting. The trays with domes were  returned to the growth chamber. The average concentra tion of inoculum for the three repetitions of this experi 
ment was 7.8 × 107 cfu mL−1. 
Cuttings were assessed for disease symptoms after 7,  14 days and 21 days post inoculation. Ratings were made  using a scale of 0–4, with 0 = no symptoms, 1 = minor  chlorosis, 2 = moderate chlorosis of leaves and/or slight  wilting 3 = obvious wilting and/or extensive chlorosis,  visible mycelial growth up stem of cutting, 4 = extreme  wilting, chlorosis and/or necrosis. The experiment was  repeated three times, with each experiment consisting of  one of each treatment group, each containing six cut tings, for a total of 18 cuttings per treatment. The disease  severity ratings for each treatment were averaged using  the data from all three repetitions of this experiment, for  each time of assessment. The data were analyzed using  a Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc Conover-Iman test and  Holm correction to determine if there were significant  differences (P < 0.05). The area under the disease pro gress curve (AUDPC) was calculated from the disease  progress curves using the 7, 14 and 18 DPI disease  severity ratings (Simko and Piepho 2012). Significant  differences between the AUDPC values of treatments  were determined by ANOVA followed post hoc by  Tukey’s HSD test at P < 0.05.

Biological control of Fusarium and Pythium on cannabis 241
Pythium inoculation, disease assessment and plant  growth measurements 
The cannabis strains ‘Island Honey’ or ‘White Rhino’  were used for experiments 1 and 2 with Pythium, respec tively. Both strains were observed to be susceptible to  infection by Pythium (Punja et al. 2021; unpublished  observations). Cuttings were dipped in Remo Roots  (Maple Ridge, BC) rooting hormone and placed in  a T24 Turboklone (Reno, NV, USA) aeroponic cloning  system provided with a humidity dome that was misted  with water. The Turboklone was placed under two 54 watt  6400 k T5HO Sunblaster lights with a 24-hr photoperiod.  The reservoir of the Turboklone contained Rapid Start  (General Hydroponics, Santa Rosa, CA, USA) at a rate  of 0.25 mL L−1 and approximately 7.5 L of tap water  adjusted to a pH of 5.8–6.2 using Advanced Nutrients pH Down (Advanced Nutrients. West Hollywood, CA, USA).  When cuttings had rooted and hardened off (approxi 
mately 14 days after being placed in the Turboklone  units), they were potted in a 3:1 mix of coco (Canna  Coco) and perlite (Dutch Treat) in 8.5 cm2 pots. Pots  were randomly assigned to specific trays, with six pots  per tray, which were randomly assigned a treatment.  Plants were watered with a nutrient solution containing  1 mL L−1 Sensi Grow Coco pH Perfect A + B (Advanced  Nutrients, West Hollywood, CA, USA) and 1 mL L−1  General Hydroponics Calimagic (General Hydroponics,  Santa Rosa, CA, USA) adjusted to a pH of 5.8–6.2  using Advanced Nutrients pH-Down prior to addition of  the biocontrol treatments. Subsequently, plants were  watered as needed with the same solution. 
The biocontrol treatments included Rootshield Plus WP,  Asperello, Lalstop and Stargus (Table 1). Biocontrol trea ted plants in experiment 1 received 25 mL of the biocontrol  agent while plants in experiment 2 received 50 mL to  compare effect of biocontrol application levels. Negative  control groups received an equal volume of water.  Treatments were applied 7 days in advance of the addition  of P. myriotylum inoculum, with the exception of one of the  Stargus treatment groups in experiment 1, where the bio 
control was applied 2 days (Stargus 2d) before the addition  of Pythium rather than 7 days prior (Stargus 7d). After  treatment, all trays were placed randomly inside a growth  chamber (Conviron Adaptis, A1000 model) set at 30°C  with a 24-hr photoperiod provided by four 21 w 4100k  bulbs After one week, a scalpel was used to wound the  roots of the plants by inserting it into the growing medium,  approximately 3 cm away from the stem and penetrating 2–  3 cm deep. Blended Pythium inoculum was poured into  each pot, with the exception of the negative control. Plants  in experiment 1 received 20 mL of inoculum and plants in  
experiment 2 received 40 mL to compare the effect of  pathogen inoculum level. The average concentration of  inoculum used was 3.25 × 103 cfu mL−1 and 1.34 × 103  cfu mL−1 for the first and second experiment, respectively. 
Plants were assessed for disease severity using a scale  of 0–5, where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = minor chlorosis,  2 = moderate chlorosis, plants appear stunted, 3 = severe  chlorosis, plants appear stunted and/or wilted, 4 = extreme  chlorosis, stunting and/or or wilting is pronounced,  5 = plants wilted and dead. Plants in experiment 1  were assessed at 7, 14 and 18 days post inoculation  (DPI) while plants in experiment 2 were assessed at 7,  14, 18 and 21 DPI. In addition, at each assessment time,  the height of each plant was measured. When the experi ment concluded at 18 or 21 DPI, the shoots of plants  were removed from the roots, by cutting them at the  crown, and weighed. Excess growing medium was  removed from roots by shaking them by hand and then  rinsing thoroughly in water. The length of each root mass  was then measured from where roots started on the stem  to where the majority of roots ended. Roots were left on  paper towels to air dry for approximately 30 min and  then weighed. Each experiment was repeated 3 times, to  provide 18 plants per treatment in each experiment. 
All disease severity scores and plant growth measure ments (shoot height, shoot weight, root length and root  weight) were averaged for each of the treatments and  time points per experiment. To determine statistical dif ferences (P < 0.05) between the disease severity ratings  in each treatment, the data were analyzed using  a Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc Conover-Iman test and  Holm correction. To determine statistical differences  between the heights and weights of each treatment,  data were compared using ANOVA followed by a post  hoc Tukey’s HSD test at P < 0.05. For each experiment,  the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was  calculated from the disease progress curves using the  respective disease severity ratings for each experiment  (Simko and Piepho 2012). Significant differences  between the AUDPC values of treatments were deter 
mined by ANOVA followed post hoc by Tukey’s HSD  test at P < 0.05. 
Endophytic colonization of cuttings 
Cuttings of strain ‘Moby Dick’ or ‘White Rhino’ were  inserted into 4 cm Grodan rockwool blocks arranged in  a plastic container, with six cuttings per container.  Cuttings were arranged based on genotype (‘Moby  Dick’ or ‘White Rhino’) and treatments were then ran 
domly assigned to these blocks. The biocontrol agents  
C. Scott and Z. K. Punja 242
Rootshield, Asperello or Lalstop were added at 500 mL  per container (as per rates in Table 1). After 30 min, the  excess solution was poured out and the containers were  placed onto individual trays, covered by a humidity  dome, and randomly placed in a Conviron Adaptis  growth chamber set at 24°C. Control cuttings received  an equal volume of water. Plants received 24-hr of light  provided by a Sunblaster brand 24 watt 6400 k T5HO  lamp. After 2 or 7 days, cuttings were removed and their  foliage was trimmed. The stems were surface sterilized  as previously described. Each stem was then sectioned  into three segments (0–5, 5–10 and 10–15 cm) and two  pieces of tissue from each segment were plated on PDA  +S. The recovery of fungal colonies was recorded after  7 days of incubation under ambient laboratory condi tions. The experiment was conducted twice per time  point (2 and 7 DPI) and per cannabis strain utilized, for  a total of 24 samples (12 plants) per segment for each  treatment. 
To test for statistical significance between the  mean percent recovery values of different treatments in  the same segment (i.e. all of the treatments in the 0–5 cm  segment), means were compared using ANOVA fol 
lowed by a post hoc Tukey’s HSD test at P < 0.05.  Comparisons were also made using ANOVA followed  by a post hoc Tukey’s HSD test at P < 0.05 to test for  differences in mean percent recovery of endophytic fungi  of the same treatment in different segments (Rootshield  colonization at 0–5 cm compared to 5–10 cm, for exam 
ple). The cannabis strains were analyzed separately, and  all comparisons were made within the same time point (2  DPI or 7 DPI). 
Experimental design 
Experiments assessing the efficacy of biocontrol pro ducts against Fusarium or Pythium were conducted  using a randomized block design. A randomized block  design was utilized to determine to what degree biocon trol agents may endophytically colonize the stems of  cannabis cuttings as well. All factors were fixed, and  no random sampling of the experimental populations  was conducted. All data analysis was done in  R (Version 4.2.0) using the ‘PMCMRplus’ package. 
Results 
Fusarium inoculation and disease assessment 
The mean disease severity values due to Fusarium infec tion for all biocontrol treatments except Rhapsody were  significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the inoculated control  
at 7 days after inoculation (data not shown). When  compared to plants inoculated with Fusarium only,  Lalstop, Rootshield and Stargus treated plants all had  P values < 0.001, while Asperello treated plants had  a P value of 0.003. At 14 days, cuttings treated with  Lalstop (P < 0.001) had the lowest disease rating while  Rootshield (P = 0.01), Asperello (P = 0.01) and Stargus  (P = 0.04) provided intermediate, but still significant,  protection (Fig. 1). At 21 days post inoculation, the same  trends can be seen. Lalstop, Rootshield, Asperello and  Stargus treated cuttings had P values of < 0.001, < 0.001,  0.01 and 0.04, respectively, when their average disease  severities were compared to that of Fusarium only trea ted plants. When the AUDPC values were analyzed, the  same significant differences were present between treat ments as were present at 21 DPI (Fig. 1). Cuttings  treated with the biocontrol agents appeared greener and  more vigorous compared to those inoculated with  Fusarium only, although chlorosis of the foliage was  still evident on all cuttings, especially as the experiment  progressed (Fig. 2). Mycelial growth and the incidence  of lesions on the stems of cuttings treated with Lalstop,  Rootshield and Asperello were also reduced compared to  the control group, in which mycelium grew up the stems,  resulting in death of the cuttings. 
Pythium inoculation and disease assessment 
In both experiments, application of biocontrol products  as drenches had varying levels of efficacy against  Pythium root rot. In experiment 1, Stargus (P = 0.01)  applied at 2 days prior to Pythium inoculation provided  the greatest reduction in disease rated at 7 days (data not  shown). At 14 days, none of the biocontrol treatments  significantly reduced mean disease severity rating com 
pared to the Pythium control. However, at 18 DPI,  Lalstop (P < 0.001) significantly reduced mean disease  severity while the remaining treatments (Stargus 2d,  Stargus 7d, Rootshield and Asperello) did not (Fig. 3).  When the AUDPC values of these treatments were com 
pared, there were no significant differences between  biocontrol treated plants and the Pythium treated plants  (Fig. 3). Plants treated with Lalstop, Rootshield or  Asperello generally had fewer symptoms of chlorosis  or wilting and appeared more vigorous at 18 days  (Fig. 4a). When the roots of these plants were examined,  they had fewer lesions, more feeder roots and the root  volume was larger. By comparison, roots of the control  plants were necrotic, with fewer feeder roots and had  reduced volume (Fig. 4b). In experiment 1, none of the  biocontrol treatments had a significant effect on plant

height compared to the Pythium control (data not  shown). Shoot wet weight, root length and root wet  weight were also not affected compared to the Pythium  control for any treatment, except for Lalstop (P < 0.001),  which had mean fresh root weights that were equivalent  to those of the uninoculated control (data not shown). 
In the second Pythium experiment all treatments sig nificantly reduced disease severity ratings at 7 days  (Lalstop P = 0.001, Rootshield P = 0.009, Asperello  P = 0.009 and Stargus P = 0.009), at 14 days (Lalstop  P < 0.001, Rootshield P = 0.01, Asperello P = 0.003 and  Stargus P = 0.02) and at 21 days after inoculation  
(Lalstop P < 0.001, Rootshield P = 0.001, Asperello  P = 0.001 and Stargus P = 0.002) compared to the  Pythium control (Fig. 5). The AUDPC values of biocon trol treated plants were all significantly lower than those  of the Pythium treated group (Fig. 5). A similar trend  was observed as in the first experiment, with biocontrol  treated plants generally having less symptoms of chloro sis and wilting as well as roots that were larger in  volume, with more feeder roots and less symptoms of  rot (Fig. 6). In this experiment, there were no significant  differences in plant height, shoot wet weight or root  length (data not shown) between the biocontrol treatment

Discussion 
Damping-off, as well as root and crown rot caused by  Fusarium and Pythium spp., have been reported to occur  in several regions of Canada and the USA where canna bis and hemp are grown (Punja and Rodriquez 2018;  Punja et al. 2018; Gauthier et al. 2019). Currently,  
producers have limited options for disease management  as chemical fungicides are not registered for use on  either crop. The Pest Management Regulatory Agency  has approved the use of several biological control pro 
ducts in Canada, including Asperello T34, Rootshield  Plus WP, Lalstop and Trianum (Health Canada 2022).  The results from this study demonstrated that Lalstop  and Rootshield provided the greatest reduction in disease  symptoms caused by both Fusarium and Pythium,  including minimizing reductions in root weight, when  they were applied 48-hr or 7 days, respectively, prior to  pathogen exposure. Asperello and Stargus were also  effective in reducing Fusarium but were less effective

against Pythium, and had no significant effect on root  weights in either Pythium experiment. 
Some of the differences in the efficacy of biocontrol  treatments at managing disease caused by P. myriotylum  between experiments may be attributed to the amounts of  pathogen inoculum and biocontrol products used in each  experiment. It is possible that the level of inoculum used  in the first trial was insufficient to cause adequate dis 
ease; therefore, the effects of the biocontrol agents could  not be distinguished from the control. Conversely, the  amount of biocontrol product applied in the first experi ment may not have been adequate to have actually man aged disease in any significant way. More research is  needed to determine to what degree the rate of applica tion of biocontrol products has an effect on their efficacy  
at managing both Fusarium and Pythium on cannabis. On cannabis cuttings, the inoculum causing initial  infection may originate from within the environment in  which the cuttings are rooted, which is kept warm (24–  27°C) and humid (70–90% relative humidity). Spores of  F. oxysporum have been detected in the air in the rooting  rooms, as well as in recirculating water (Punja 2020b).  In addition, cuttings may have incipient infections origi nating from the stock plants, where F. oxysporum was  shown to be transmitted internally and asymptomatically,  
likely present in the pith and xylem tissues (Punja  2020b). Therefore, biocontrol agents applied to cuttings  should be able to colonize the cut surface, the emerging  roots, as well as grow internally in the pith tissues. In  this study, the biocontrol agents were applied 48-hr prior  to pathogen inoculation to ensure this colonization had  occurred. Endophytic colonization, defined as recovery  following surface-sterilization of tissues, was observed  to occur by both Gliocladium and Trichoderma spp. in  the 0–10 cm stem segments of cuttings, suggesting that  this could be one of the mechanisms through which  disease was reduced, i.e. through competitive exclusion  of the pathogen. 
The active ingredient in Lalstop (previously known as  Prestop) is G. catenulatum (Clonostachys rosea  f. catenulata) strain J1446. In previous research, this  biocontrol agent was shown to significantly reduce root  and stem rot severity and seedling mortality on green 
house cucumbers, caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis cucumerinum, when it was applied as a drench 24-hr or  48-hr prior to inoculation with the pathogen (Rose et al.  2003). In addition, applications of G. catenulatum on  spinach plants controlled F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae  wilt, as well as Fusarium wilt caused by F. foetens on  Hiemlais begonia (Tian and Zheng 2013). Preventative

Fig. 5 Efficacy of four biological control agents in reducing disease severity due to Pythium myriotylum on cannabis plants (experiment 2).  Disease rating was assessed at 7 (data not shown), 14, 18 (data not shown) and 21 days post inoculation (DPI). Data are the means from three  replicate experiments with six plants per treatment (n = 18). Different letters above each bar denote significant differences in the disease  severity ratings determined through a Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc Conover-Iman test and Bonferonni correction (P < 0.05). The bottom left  graph shows cumulative disease progression over time for each of the treatments and significant differences at 21 DPI. The bottom right  graph shows the AUDPC values of the treatments, with different letters above each bar denoting significant differences in these values as  determined through ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test (P < 0.05). All error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. 
applications of Prestop also reduced Fusarium crown  and root rot on greenhouse peppers, caused by  F. oxysporum, and other Fusarium diseases (Cummings  et al. 2009; Cerkauskas 2017). In this study, treatment  with Lalstop 48-hr prior to pathogen inoculation signifi 
cantly reduced disease severity on cannabis cuttings due  to F. oxysporum at 7, 14 and 21 DPI. 
In previous research, G. catenulatum was also shown  to be effective against Pythium-incited diseases.  Damping-off on American ginseng seedlings, caused by  P. ultimum and Fusarium spp., was significantly reduced  when Prestop Mix was used as a seed treatment and as  a drench to beds (Rahman and Punja 2007). In both  
growth chamber and greenhouse trials, Prestop or  Prestop Mix drenches significantly reduced  P. aphanidermatum development on cucumber,  lowering percent plant mortality compared to plants  treated with the pathogen only (Punja and Yip 2003).  In this study, Lalstop significantly reduced disease sever 
ity due to P. myriotylum on cannabis plants at 18 DPI in  experiment 1 and at all time points in experiment 2. In  the first experiment, Lalstop treated plants also had  improved average fresh root weights that were not sig 
nificantly different from the uninoculated control. The rhizocompetency and efficacy of G. catenulatum  against Fusarium and Pythium is reported to be due to

Fig. 6 Symptoms of root infection caused by Pythium myriotylum on cannabis plants with and without application of four biocontrol agents.  Treatments from left to right are: Pythium myriotylum, water, Rootshield, Asperello, Lalstop and Stargus. Plants treated with biocontrol  agents had roots that were larger in volume, with reduced symptoms of necrosis, and had more intact root hairs compared to plants that  received the pathogen only. Roots were removed from the pots 21 days after inoculation with Pythium. Results shown are from experiment 2. 
multiple mechanisms, including production of enzymes  such as β-1,3-glucanases that inhibit pathogen growth,  mycoparasitic activity, and enhanced rhizosphere and  root colonization (McQuilken et al. 2000; Chatterton  et al. 2008; Chatterton and Punja 2009). Endophytic  colonization of cacao and cucumber plants by  G. catenulatum has been shown to occur (Rubini et al.  2005; Chatterton et al. 2008). It is conceivable that  similar modes of suppression of Fusarium and Pythium  on cannabis plants are occurring following application of  G. catenulatum but further studies are needed to confirm  this. 
Trichoderma spp., including those formulated in  Rootshield (T. harzianum strain KRL-AG2 and  T. virens strain G-41) and Asperello (T. asperellum strain  T34) have been reported to reduce a number of plant  diseases, including Fusarium wilt on tomato  (F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici) (Larkin and Fravel  1998; Taghdi et al. 2015; Hasan et al. 2020), cucumber  (F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum) (Li et al. 2019) and  on field and greenhouse-grown strawberry (F. solani)  (Pastrana et al. 2016). Additionally, diseases such as  damping off on pea, tomato, lettuce, and root rot of  cucumber, tomato and lettuce caused by Pythium spp.  have been shown to be suppressed by applications of  Trichoderma spp. (Lynch et al. 1991; Wolffhechel and  Jensen 1992; Naseby et al. 2000; Utkhede et al. 2000;  Jayaraj et al. 2006; Elshahawy and El-Mohamedy 2019).  In this study, Rootshield and Asperello applications both  
reduced disease caused by F. oxysporum at 7, 14 and 21  DPI. Applications of Rootshield and Asperello also  reduced disease caused by P. myriotylum, with signifi 
cant effects being observed in experiment 2. Similar to G. catenulatum, Trichoderma spp. are  known to exert biocontrol activity through direct inter actions with plant pathogens, by secretion of enzymes,  antibiosis, mycoparasitism and competition for  resources, as well as through interactions and associa tions with plants. These interactions may include colo nization of root tissues internally (as endophytes) and  externally (Harman et al. 2004; Contreras-Cornejo et al.  2016). This may in turn induce local or systemic resis tance to pathogens and increase plant growth and toler ance to abiotic stresses (Benhamou and Chet 1997;  Green et al. 2001; Harman et al. 2004; Druzhinina  et al. 2011; Mukherjee et al. 2012; Contreras-Cornejo  et al. 2016). The mechanisms by which disease develop ment was reduced in cannabis cuttings is unknown but  likely involves a number of the above mechanisms. Bacillus subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens are reported  to reduce root rot and damping off caused by soilborne  pathogens, including Fusarium and Pythium spp.  (Abdelzaher 2003; Jayaraj et al. 2005; Zouari et al.  2016; Shahzad et al. 2017; Han et al. 2019; Ni and  Punja 2019). In this study, when applied as a drench to  rockwool blocks, B. amyloliquefaciens significantly  reduced disease severity due to F. oxysporum at 7, 14  and 21 DPI, while B. subtilis had no effect. In the first

The surface-sterilized stem pieces were divided into 5 cm long segments and two pieces of tissue from each  section were plated onto PDA+S. Percent recovery after 2 days and 7 days are shown for genotypes Moby Dick (MBD) and White Rhino  (WHR). Data are the means from two experiments, with six cuttings per treatment per experiment. Different letters above each bar denote  significant differences in the percent recovery of biocontrol agents as determined through ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test (P < 0.05).  Lower case letters are used to compare between treatments within the same segment length, whereas upper case letters are used to compare  within the same treatment at different segment lengths. No comparisons are being made between different time points or different genotypes.  Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. 
Pythium experiment, there was a significant reduction in  disease severity at 7 DPI following application of  B. amyloliquefaciens 2 days prior to inoculation with  the pathogen. For the remainder of the experiment, how 
ever, neither treatment group (Stargus 2d and Stargus 7d)  had a significant effect on disease severity. In experiment  2, this biocontrol agent significantly suppressed disease  caused by Pythium when applied at 7 days prior to  inoculation with the pathogen at all time points.  Bacillus spp. have been reported to colonize plants endo 
phytically, in turn promoting their growth and suppres sing disease through a range of mechanisms (Sturz et al.  2000; Tan et al. 2013; Zouari et al. 2016; Shahzad et al.  
2017; Ni and Punja 2019). These bacteria may colonize  and benefit cannabis plants in a similar manner, but this  has yet to be demonstrated. 
The results from this study support the use of the  currently registered biocontrol products on cannabis for  management of Fusarium and Pythium species in  Canada. Additional research is needed to evaluate the  efficacy of the biocontrol products on a larger scale and  over longer periods of time and in different production  systems. The impact of repeated applications of these  biocontrol products later in the production cycle and the  extent of survival of microbial agents in the growing  media also needs to be evaluated. In this study, the

ability of several biocontrol agents to colonize cannabis  stem tissues endophytically was demonstrated. The  extent to which they may persist on or within cannabis  tissues over an extended period of time, as well as their  potential growth promoting and pathogen suppressing  effects require further research.
