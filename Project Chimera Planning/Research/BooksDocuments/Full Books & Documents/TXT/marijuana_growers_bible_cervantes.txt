In Memoriam:

Dedication

Steven McWilliams

This book is dedicated to Sebastain Orfali;
Roger Watanabe; my mother, father, wife and
family; all cannabis medical patients; and all
the people who have suffered the effects of the
War on (prohibited cannabis) Drugs. We share
a common affliction. Some law enforcement
and political agents have shared our pain;
others are in different stages of denial. May the
Christian God, Buddha, Allah, Sheba, and the
God you worship, bless you all.

Scared of possible jail time, in constant pain
and tired of battling for medical marijuana
patients' rights, Steven McWilliams committed
suicide in San Diego on Monday July 11, 2005,
on his 51st birthday.
Mr. McWilliams was famous nationwide for his
efforts and the legitimacy he lent to the medi¬
cal marijuana movement. Not taken seriously
at first, McWilliams did not give up, working for
the movement since as early as 1996 when
California state voters approved Proposition 215,
allowing patients to use marijuana for medical
purposes when prescribed by a doctor.
Steven McWilliams worked to implement
Proposition 215 locally in San Diego. Showing
up weekly for City Council meetings carrying a
marijuana plant, he urged the local politicians to
come up with a plan for the distribution of mari¬
juana. As a result the city came up with standards
for the number of plants allowed by users. Mr.
McWilliams served on a city-organized commit¬
tee for a time that dealt with these issues. He
ran for city council a few times, when he wasn't
alternately suing the city.
In spite of all this, he was convicted in 2003
for illegal cultivation, and sentenced to a sixmonth federal prison term. Still out on appeal
at the time of his suicide, he was in chronic and
serious pain-the judge had ordered that he not
use marijuana. Mr. McWilliams suffered severe

side effects from the use of standard prescription
painkillers. He left a note saying that the pain
was too much to bear, and he hoped his suicide
would help change the government's position
towards marijuana as a medicine.
Memorial services were held in San Diego
at City Hall, white roses were passed to the
attendees.
Steph Sherer, executive director of Americans
for Safe Access said, "Steve McWilliams was tor¬
tured by the federal government because of the
medication he needed."

The Native Suns Dispensary opened in San Diego on June 6, 2005, in defiance of the Supreme Court's
ruling against individual states' medical marijuana laws. In a 6-5 split-decision, Justice Paul Stevens said
that Congress has a moral responsibility to change the nation's laws regarding cannabis use for medical
patients. In writing the decision, Justice Stevens did find that the federal government did not exceed
its authority under law when federal officers raided medical marijuana patients with California state
prescriptions.

The War on Drugs
The War on Drugs in "America, Land of the
Free" is out of control. This War on American citi¬
zens and many other unfortunate souls around
the world continues to be driven by fear and
misinformation that is spun by numerous US
and foreign government agencies.
The War on Drugs concentrates on encarcerating cannabis users and is headed by a drug
czar.
Czar is defined by Webster's Dictionary, as 1.
A former Russian emperor. 2. An autocrat. 3.
Informal. One in authority: Leader. From these
definitions we know that a Drug Czar is not one
to listen to any opposition. Is this the basis of
democracy?
The most infamous American Drug Czars
include: William Bennet (a tobacco smoker,
alcohol

drinker

and

compulsive

gambler)

General Barry McCaffrey (the most decorated
US General and instigator of failed "anti-can¬
nabis media propaganda"), and John Walters (a
career bureaucrat who labels peaceful cannabis
consumers as terrorists). All past and present
Drug Czars profess "high moral standards."
Many official Government and private reports
have recommended legalization or decriminal¬

than 10,000 years. Cannabis is being legally dis¬
pensed medicinally in 10 US states, Canada, the
Netherlands and Spain. Still the US Government
classifies cannabis as a Schedule I drug along
with heroin as having no medical value.
The July 30, 2004 editon of the Seattle Times
reported "Marijuana smuggling case first local
use of Patriot Act provision. The US attorney in
Seattle, WA charged 15 people in a marijuana
smuggling operation. The undercover snitch,
a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
agent, posed as a middle man who actually
smuggled money from the US to Canada.
The alleged cannabis and

money smug¬

glers were charged under the Patriot Act. The
Patriot Act was passed into law in the US in
order to thwart international terrorism after
the September 11 attacks on the World Trade
Center towers in New York City. However
according to US attorney Todd Greenberg in
Seattle, "there is no indication these defendants
are connected to terrorism."

Introduction

The "Bible" has gone through a complete metamorphosis since
the first edition in 1983. The First Edition was just 96 pages, black
and white and bound with a pair of staples. I wrote the book on a
Kaypro II computer. To typeset I hooked my Kaypro to a VAX main¬
frame computer. The typeset "galleys" were pasted up into "hard
copy." I printed the book on a Multilith press. My wife and I collated
pages and stapled them together to form the first Indoor Marijuana

The book covers below
are some of the many
published by Jorge.

Horticulture book. The book immediately became a best-seller

"The Bible" by indoor growers. The Third Edition (1993) grew to 320

among indoor growers and has remained on top ever since!
The Second Edition (1985) grew to 288 pages and was christened
pages and the Fourth Edition (2001) tipped the scales at 432 pages
and contained 200 color photos and drawings. The Bible is published
in Dutch, German, French, English, and Spanish. There is also a spe¬
cial UK Edition. The Australian Edition was banned by the Australian

Government, but lofty Auzzies still find ways to bring in the Bible.
The Fifth Edition has a little larger format (6 x 8.25 inches [150 x
210 cm]), 512 pages and is full-color throughout with more than
1100 fuil color photographs, drawings, charts, and graphs. It is
completely rewritten to reflect the changes in cannabis cultivation

and medicine in recent years. Sections on medical cannabis, seeds,
seedlings, vegetative growth, cloning, flowering, breeding and hash
have been amplified substantially. All-new sections have been added
on greenhouses and outdoor growing. Photos and precise color
drawings augment text to simplify information so that it is easier to
assimilate.
Digital cameras, fast computers with big hard disks, and fast
Internet connections have transformed the Bible into a much more
complete work.

years. The expense of adding color to each and every page, hiring
editors, travel, office overhead, and inflation have made it necessary
to sell a minimum of advertising as well as increase the price to

The Internet was developed by the DOD (Department of Defense) in the latter half of the 20th
century. Government geeks and spooks developed the World Wide Web for national security reasons.
It is easy to set up a proxy server along with a few other safety precautions to surf with safety so the
government cannot track your every move.
\

Be very careful when surfing the Internet. Check out www.webopedia.com/rERM/p/proxy server,
html for more information about surfing safely.
Smart growers, especially from countries with draconian laws, do not e-mail about growing or
surf grow sites on a computer located in a grow house. Remember, a person never knows who is
peeking at transparent e-mail. "Firewall" software alerts and protects the user against another party
tracking a surfing path or to unauthorized entry into their computer. Ask at your local software store
for security software to keep unwanted computer spooks subdued.
Check out www.proxyblind.org/ for more information on surfing anonymously.
Do not frequent marijuana sites or talk shop on the net unless you have taken appropriate security
measures.

Internet information can be great or it can be
packed with problems. All growers and "author¬
ities" have the same status on the Internet, and
can post "facts" to their site or news group.
Many times unverified, poorly researched "facts"
are either self-serving or untrue. Always ask
yourself if the information you are reading
makes sense. If it sounds too good to be true, it
probably is. I often surf through many sites and
pages before finding something worth retaining.
"Free" often means the material is sales ori¬
ented. News groups provide an excellent forum
to share grow stories.

Marijuana Chemistry
Cannabis is the only plant that produces chemi¬
cals called cannabinoids. Flowever, with gene
splicing and genetic engineering, it is only a
matter of time until cannabinoids are added
to other plants. Cannabinoids are ingredients
unique to cannabis; the psychoactive canna¬
binoids are responsible for the mind-bending
effects of marijuana. Some cannabinoids get
you high. Around 40 cannabinoids have been
confirmed to exist, but most are not psychoac¬
tive. Here is a short rundown on the six most
prominent cannabinoids.

A9 THC, the main ingredient that gets you

high, is called: A9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol.
All cannabis, whether industrial hemp or drug
marijuana, contains some A9 THC. Industrial
hemp cannabis contains infinitesimal amounts
while dried flower tops (buds) of potent mari¬
juana can contain up to 25 percent A9 THC. In
potent varieties of marijuana, perhaps all of the
mind-bending effects are derived from A9 THC.
A8 THC is found in very low concentrations in
cannabis. It also gets you high, but there is so
little A8 THC in most cannabis that researchers,
breeders, and growers concentrate on the more
abundant and potent A9 THC. To simplify mat¬
ters we will refer to both A9 THC and A8 THC
as THC.
Cannabidiol, known as CBD, also appears in
virtually all varieties of cannabis. The amount of
CBD varies enormously, from a trace to more
than 95 percent of all cannabinoids present
in a plant. CBD generally has a sedative effect
regarding the high you experience. CBD, when
combined with THC, tends to postpone the
beginning of the high, but the good part is that
CBD can make it last twice as long. Whether
CBD increases or decreases the force of the
high is subjective and must be discerned by
each smoker.

Cannabinol, or CBN, is produced as THC oxi¬
dizes or degrades. Only a trace of CBN exists
in fresh bud. Stored and cured tops or hashish
have higher levels of CBN that has converted
from THC. Marijuana with high levels of CBN
generally makes the toker feel disoriented, often
sieepy or groggy, referred to as a stupefying
high. At best, CBN contains only 10 percent of
the psychoactive potency of the original THC.
Tetrahydrocannabivarin, called THCV, is the
shorter three-carbon propyl that replaces the
five-carbon pentyl chain. This compound is
associated with the fragrance of the plant. In
other words, very pungent-smelling marijuana
normally contains THCV. Warmer temperatures
bring out more smell. THCV is found in very
potent marijuana that originates in Southeast
and Central Asia as well as regions in Africa.
Concentrations of THCV usually make the high
come on quicker and disappear sooner. There is
still much research to do on this cannabinoid.
deluxe

Here is a look at a THC molecule.

Cannabichromene, or CBC, may make up to
20 percent of the cannabinoid profile in a plant.
Little study has been done on this cannabinoid.
So far, researchers believe it may interact with
THC to make the high more intense.
For a complete background on cannabinoids,
including chemical diagrams, resin profiles, and
production of cannabinoids, see the classic
book, Marijuana Grower's Guide, by Mei Frank,
Redeye Press, 1997, 330 pages.

Marijuana as Medicine
by Dr. John McPartland
Cannabis (marijuana, hashish) has long been
used for recreational and medicinal purposesfor 10,000 years or more. Its medical indications
are

manifold,

including

glaucoma,

muscle

spasticity (e.g., multiple sclerosis), movement
disorders (e.g., Huntington's disease), and a
variety of pain syndromes. Marijuana reduces

Ministry of Cannabis and Rastafari.

nausea and vomiting and enhances appetite,
so it helps people with AIDS and opposes the
side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Research
shows it can prevent the death of injured
neurons. And everyone knows it alleviates
anxiety and depression.
Marijuana research is one of the fastestmoving fields of medical science, so any books
we suggest may soon be outdated. In the
2000 edition of Indoor Marijuana Horticulture,
we recommended the book Marijuana and

Medicine (National Academy Press, 1999). This
classic book has been updated by Cannabis and
Cannabinoids (Haworth Press, 2002) and The
Medicinal Uses of Cannabis and Cannabinoids
(Pharmaceutical Press, 2004). Marijuana
Medicine by Christian Ratsch (Healing Arts
Press, 1998) is a beautiful book that focuses
on ethnobotany and the historical uses of
cannabis. Notable web sites include www.maps.

best organically grown marijuana. The methods
for cultivating pharmaceutical-grade herb are
outlined in this book. Grow the healthiest plants
possible by paying careful attention to the

must be in balance, especially nutrients. If you
get the balance right, you won't need to read the
chapters on insect and mold control. The most
common contaminants of marijuana are molds
or pesticides. Optimal cultivation eliminates the
possibility of these contaminants.

all this great information, we still preach the
bottom line: "An ounce of prevention is worth

edition of O'Shaughnessy's details the case of a
woman who fell ill while manicuring marijuana

abamectin.

Abamectin is a natural compound produced by

mix of compounds and cannot provide a
precisely defined drug effect. According to
the pharmaceutical industry, medicines are
synthetic, single-ingredient "silver bullets" that
focus upon solitary metabolic pathways in our
physiological systems. Herbalists, on the other
hand, applaud the polypharmacy of herbal
remedies and claim two advantages over single¬
ingredient drugs:

activity in a cumulative or synergistic manner.

2. Herbs may also contain compounds that
mitigate the side effects of their predominant
active ingredients.
Thus, marijuana has been characterized as a
"synergistic shotgun," in contrast with synthet¬
ic, single-ingredient "silver bullets." The many
ingredients in marijuana modulate our health
via several metabolic pathways, gently nudg¬
ing our system towards homeostasis. This kind
of "multitasking" makes marijuana impossible
to evaluate, according to the pharmaceutical
industry. But multitasking avoids the unbal¬
anced distortion of solitary metabolic pathways,
as produced by synthetic, single-ingredient sil¬
ver bullets such as Vioxx.
First and foremost in marijuana's list of ingre¬
dients is THC. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a
"new" molecule, produced by cannabis, which
evolved within the past 34 million years. Many
botanists speculate that THC initially evolved as
a toxin to deter herbivores. But this evolutionary
strategy was diverted when THC became attrac¬
tive to humans-the "botany of desire" described
by Michael Pollan. THC works in humans by
mimicking an endogenous compound that our
own bodies make, called anandamide. THC
binds to anandamide's receptors, called cannabinoid (CB) receptors. Research indicates
that CB receptors originally evolved in primi¬
tive organisms about 600 million years ago!
However, as with all chicken-and-egg questions,
the story of CB receptors and cannabis began
long before the current pair of protagonists
appeared in evolutionary time. It is probable
that both CB receptors and cannabis had evo¬
lutionary predecessors. They may date to "deep
time," before plants and animals diverged in the
primordial soup. Over many eons, CB receptors
may have become "vestigial," analogous to an
appendix, only to be reactivated when Homo
sapiens discovered cannabis. Humans have
interacted and coevolved with cannabis for mil¬
lennia, creating a complex heterogenous medi¬
cine by selecting plants that provide maximal
benefits and minimal side effects. The success
of 10,000 or more years of human refinement

with this botanical medication will be difficult
to replicate in modern laboratories. This decon¬
struction of pharmacological theory is radical,
and may herald the reintroduction of herbal
medicines into modern medical pharmacope¬
ias, with marijuana leading the way.
When THC or anandamide activate CB recep¬
tors, the CB receptors activate G-proteins. G-proteins are microscopic messengers that migrate
around cells and modulate a variety of ion chan¬
nels and enzymes. Cannabinoid receptors asso¬
ciate with different subtypes of G-proteins, such
as Gi and Gs subtypes. The "i" and "s" abbrevi¬
ate "inhibitor" and "stimulator," which describe
the opposite effects these G-proteins have on
their targets. Research has shown that different
cannabinoids preferentially activate different
subtypes of G-proteins. This may explain why
different strains of marijuana produce different
highs. For example, Afghani plants produce a
lot of cannabidiol (CBD), and perhaps CBD
preferentially activates Gi and causes an inhibi¬
tory, stony, narcotic-like effect. Whereas plants
from Thailand contain tetrahydrocannabivarin
(THCV, a propyl analogue of THC) that might
preferentially activate Gs and cause that speedy,
buzzy, Thai high.
Thanks to its mix of ingredients, marijuana
causes fewer psychological side effects (such as
anxiety and panic reactions) than pure, synthet¬
ic THC (Marinol). Clinical trials have shown that
CBD reduces the anxiety provoked by THC, and
CBD demonstrates antipsychotic effects. Anxiety
from THC may also be alleviated by terpenoids
present in marijuana. Many terpenoids are
volatile and possess sedative properties when
inhaled, including limonene, linalool, citronellol, and terpineol. Terpenoids may also mitigate
memory loss caused by pure THC. Limonene,
terpinene, carvacrol, and pulegone increase
brain acetylcholine activity. This mechanism is
shared by tacrine, a drug used for the treat¬
ment of Alzheimer's disease. Terpenoids act on
other receptors and neurotransmitters. Some
terpenoids act as serotonin uptake inhibitors (as
does Prozac®), and augment the neurotrans-

mitter GABA (as does Valium). Terpenoids

Safety and Security!
Unfortunately we must include a security
chapter in this book. You must keep your crop
secure from police and thieves alike. Ironically,
the police will cause you more problems than
thieves!
Successful indoor growers are good citizens
and keep a low profile. They keep their yard and
home clean and in excellent repair. They always
drive a street-legal car and there are no out¬
standing warrants on the drivers. Remember,
an overdue traffic ticket turns into a warrant for
the violator's arrest. Smart growers pay bills on
time, are nice to neighbors, and do not throw
noisy, wild, crazy parties.

Do not throw out any garbage that could
prove that you grow. Cops pick through it like
rats to find evidence to make a case against
gardeners. Growers live by the motto "loose lips
sink ships."
Never have seeds or grow products sent
directly to your home.
Growers and tokers have been made into "the
enemy" by the American government in the War
on Drugs. It is the job of law enforcement to
arrest the flower-growing enemy. To wage this
war on US citizens, law enforcement wields an
impressive arsenal, including draconian laws,
misinformation and high-tech surveillance giz¬
mos.
The cardinal rule of growing is: Never tell any¬
body about any garden.
Clandestine growing is as simple as the name
implies. The name of the game is secrecy. Tell
nobody and cause no suspicion. Countless
underground growers have been harvesting
crop after crop for decades in Drug War-torn
America. These benevolent souls supply much
of America today.
Stay away from other grow houses, wild par¬
ties, real criminals, etc. Always take a friend's car
to the grow store and go seldom. Travel with
others whenever possible. Your car is easy to
trace and follow. Keep your consumption habits
reasonable; don't show large cash income. Buy
large assets, houses and cars, over time. Don't
ever tell anybody you are growing or even joke
about growing. Always have a job and a reason
for your activities. Keep a low profile.
Keep your home and surrounding property in
good repair. Make sure the house is painted,
lawn mowed, and garbage picked up. Keep
electrical use to a reasonable amount, and keep
the air clean around the house. Have very few
visitors, and keep to yourself. Have minimal
conversations with neighbors.
Never trust anybody-friends, family-brother,
sister, children, even your mother! In America,
"Land of the Free," a grower can go to jail just
for giving another grower advice! The Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations [Act]

.

(RICO) conspiracy laws were enacted to break
up the Mafia. Today RICO laws are used against
growers and non-growers alike. Under the law,
a person that advises a grower to "water in the
morning" is equally guilty of growing the mari¬
juana garden, even if he never saw the garden.
RICO laws tread on the very essence of the
American Constitution.
The new Homeland Security Act further erodes
personal rights of individuals.
Never visit or telephone other growers. If visit¬
ing another grow room, that grower can impli¬
cate you with circumstantial evidence, and you
are considered as guilty as the grower!
DO NOT use booby traps, bear traps, firearms
attached to tripwires, etc., to protect your crop
I know of people who use infrared systems
that take pictures and/or start recording video
when an object of particular size/temperature
enters the vicinity.
Depending upon the country in which you
live, law enforcement must first have a search
warrant to use infrared or thermo imaging
devices to secure a search warrant. But if they
have a search warrant, such high-tech snooping
is perfectly legal. If you want to take a look at
what they see, rent heat-sensitive night-vision

glasses from your local military supply store,
or take a photo of the outside of your grow
operation with infrared film. You can also add
a filter to your digital camera and convert the
photographs with a few clicks of Photoshop to
show heat signatures.
Law enforcement has sophisticated telephone
bugging devices, super-sensitive directional
microphones, infrared scopes, thermal imaging,
etc. They can also subpoena telephone, Internet,
and electrical company records. Intimidating
cops coerce electric company employees to
break the law and give them the records of
unsuspecting consumers. Tracking telephone
numbers, including location, is very easy. There
has been more than one case where US
law enforcement illegally acquired telephone
records and placed illegal taps on garden store
telephones. American police use telephone
records to target grow houses. Always use pay
telephones with an untraceable phone card or
pay with coins. Lazy narcs also watch garden
store parking lots and follow clients home.
Pay all bills and make all purchases with cash.
Cash tells no tales and leaves no trails. Pay for
mail order merchandise with a money order.
Have the merchandise sent to a "safe" address.

If you want to take photos of your garden, use
a digital camera. Using an old-fashioned film
camera, you risk discovery when getting the
film developed.
Growers who cultivate cannabis, including
medical cannabis, should never show their
grow show to anyone! Never tell anyone you
are growing. Deny growing to everyone, always!
You immediately change from a Weed Warrior
to a helpless victim subject to extortion the
instant anybody knows you are growing in
the USA. When the cops arrest a "friend" that
has seen your grow show, they can legally use
deception and intimidation to trick your "friend"
into squealing on you. Beware! Interrogations
can last for months!
Law enforcement rewards jealous, hateful,
and vindictive "friends," lovers, and enemies for
implicating a grower under the RICO laws and
Homeland Security Act. Hundreds of thousands
of growers have had their lives ruined in a mat¬
ter of moments on testimony from a vindictive
"friend."
All electrical outlets, fuses, and connections
must be grounded. Inspect electrical connec¬
tions for signs of heat-blackened wires, melted
connections, and smelly wiring.
Have a current fire extinguisher rated to put
out wood, paper, grease, oil, and electrical
fires.
When law enforcement has "evidence" of
a growing operation, they look for more. In
the USA they look at telephone, electric, and
shipping records, for starters. A thermal imag¬
ing camera is most often used at this point.
Occasionally they use dogs trained to sniff out
marijuana. The information is used against the
grower to obtain a search warrant. If there are
plants discovered at the house, they continue
to build the case against the grower by using
anything the grower says. The police collect
most of the information on the grower from
the grower!
Surround your property with a bed of cedar
shavings instead of bark chips in the flower¬
beds. Cedar shavings disguise other odors. Use

a carbon filter and an ozone generator to neu¬
tralize the marijuana fragrance. Have a ready
reason for extra electrical consumption. Unload
grow supplies a little bit at a time or from within
a locked garage.
Remember the quote from Bart Simpson: "I
didn't do it. Nobody saw me. You can't prove
a thing!"
Absentee owners are the best landlords. Make
sure home inspections are done before you
move into the home and the rental agreement
should allow for an advance notification of
inspections. Put the telephone, electricity, gar¬
bage, etc., in a friend's name. Grow in a rented
home. If you have bank accounts and stocks,
own property such as a home, automobile, ATV,
etc., in the USA, they are often forfeited if you
are "suspected" of growing. You do not need to
be convicted of any crime for your assets to be
confiscated!
Curb noise and odors by sealing and insulat¬
ing the grow room with "sound board." Similar
to sheetrock, sound board muffles sounds well.
Install rubber feet or grommets on fan feet.

UANA HORTICULTURE
Security Checklist:
• Regular schedule
• Simple lifestyle
• Very little contact with neighbors
• Always be pleasant
• Never open the grow room door for
anybody!
• Electric bill should be about the same as
the neighbors and previous tenants
• Garden and grounds should be tidy and
similar to neighbors
• No light leaks whatsoever
• Use friend's car to visit grow store
• No noise-humming, fan on/off at night,
etc.—is audible day and night
• No strange odors, including ozone smell
Build an extra room or box (allow for airflow)
around ballasts to muffle noise. Place a thick
pad under ballasts to absorb vibrations. In-line
fans are much quieter and more efficient than
squirrel-cage blowers. If light escapes from
vents, give venting a 90-degree turn and paint
the vent black where it turns. This will eliminate
unsightly light leaks. Ozone-treated air should
discharge through a roof vent or chimney

Keep air conditioner water from draining outside.

to decrease ground-level odors. See "Ozone
Generators" in Chapter Thirteen. Be careful
when installing a ceiling vent or when venting
out chimney. Light shining out the chimney and
around roof vents looks very suspicious!
"All electric" homes are few and far between.
Electrical use information from previous tenants
might be available from the electric company.
On the average, growers in the USA can use
one 1000-watt lamp per bedroom. This means
a two bedroom home can host 2000 watts, a

Now, relatively inexpensive (less than $10,000)
thermal imaging devices are becoming more
affordable for smaller police forces. Thermal
imaging devices have been used legally to
measure the heat signature escaping from
structures. This invasive "evidence" is used with
other "evidence" to secure a search warrant.
According to US police sources, the devices are
legal only to find heat escaping from windows,
vents, etc. Most often narcs use the cameras
illegally to secure a search warrant. They slither
around the neighborhood early in the morning
or under the cloak of darkness to snap the hot
shots. The law stipulates specific parameters
for the camera, and the technology is relatively
arcane. The "approved" imaging devices are
able to record differences in heat levels outside
of buildings. In the USA, it is illegal to search
the inside of a structure for the "heat signature."
However, today there are devices that can actu¬
ally "see through walls" to provide an image
based on the heat a person emits.
Avoid thermal imaging problems by turning
grow lights on during the daytime. The daytime
heat and light make accurate measurement of
\

heat coming from vents and windows impossible. Thermal
imaging cameras are rendered useless; the technology will
not work during the daytime. Shield and insulate walls and
windows from heat loss from lamps. Store ballasts in separate
rooms, and channel the heat away from the grow room. Cool
grow room air before exhausting outdoors. Air vented out
underneath a structure is nice and cool before mixing with the
outdoor environment.
Growers having problems with thermal imaging should con¬
tact NORML, 1001 Connecticut Ave. NW, suite 710, Washington,
DC 20036, Tel: 1-202-483-7205. They have an excellent study
on thermal imaging devices and legal aspects compiled by
Carlos Ghigiotti. This information could save another lawyer a
lot of time.
In June of 2001, the Supreme Court decided a case brought
against Oregon resident Danny Kyllo. The decision determined
that the use of a thermal imaging device constitutes an illegal
search. High-tech thermal imaging devices often get as much
press as police bullying tactics. Law enforcement officials can
legally lie, cheat, and steal to acquire evidence against peaceful,
plant-loving growers. Deception is one of their biggest weap¬
ons, and snitches their best allies. Law enforcement legally
coerces terrified growers into squealing on their friends and
family. The lesson here is simple; do not tell anybody, under
any circumstances, that you are growing in the United States of
America. Growers are arrested daily on "hearsay" evidence from
an arrested informant. Stay away from the heat.
One last bit of simple security detail: grow efficiently! Growers
in a Drug War-torn America should harvest 0.5 grams of dried
bud every month for each watt of light in the flowering room.
Growers that do not har¬
vest this much are cheat¬
ing themselves and need to
master the basics of grow¬
ing. Always grow fewer than
99 total plants in America.
Federal laws require a fiveyear minimum sentence
with no parole when con¬
victed of growing 100-1000
plants.

Always keep a fire extinguisher
nearby.

Introduction

A seed that is planted in the spring will grow
strong and tall through the summer and flower
in the fall, producing more seeds. The annual
cycle starts all over again when the new seeds
sprout the following year. In nature, cannabis
goes through distinct growth stages. The text
and photos below show each stage of growth.

The key to successful indoor cannabis cultiva¬
tion is to understand how cannabis produces
food and grows. Cannabis, whether cultivated
indoors or out, has the same requirements
for growth. It needs light, air, water, nutrients,
a growing medium, and heat to manufacture
food and to grow. Without any one of these
essentials, growth stops and death soon results.
Indoors, the light must be of the proper spec¬
trum and intensity; air must be warm, arid, and
rich in carbon dioxide; water must be abundant
but not excessive, and the growing medium
must contain the proper levels of nutrients for
vigorous growth. When all these needs are
met consistently at optimum levels, optimum
growth is the result.
Cannabis is normally grown as an annual
plant, completing its life cycle within one year.

After 3-7 days of germination, plants enter
the seedling growth stage which lasts about a
month. During the first growth stage the seed
germinates or sprouts, establishes a root sys¬
tem, and grows a stem and a few leaves.

Life Cycle of Cannabis

Germination
During germination moisture, heat, and air
activate hormones (cytokinins, gibberellins, and
auxins) within the durable outer coating of the
seed. Cytokinins signal more cells to form and
gibberellins to increase cell size. The embryo

growth.

expands, nourished by a supply of stored food
within the seed. Soon, the seed's coating splits, a
rootlet grows downward, and a sprout with seed
leaves pushes upwards in search of light.

Seedling Growth
The single root from the seed grows down
and branches out, similar to the way the stem
branches up and out above ground. Tiny root¬
lets draw in water and nutrients (chemical
substances needed for life). Roots also serve to
anchor a plant in the growing medium. Seedling
should receive 16-18 hours of light to maintain
strong healthy growth.

Vegetative Growth
Vegetative growth is maintained by giving
plants 16-24 hours of light every day. As the
plant matures, the roots take on specialized
functions. The center and old, mature portions
contain a water transport system and may also
store food. The tips of the roots produce elon¬
gating cells that continue to push farther and
farther into the soil in search of more water
and food. The single-celled root hairs are the
parts of the root that actually absorb water and
nutrients. Without water, frail root hairs will dry

in a 5-gallon (19L) bucket and was grown in a
greenhouse.

weeks of vegetative growth.

pre-flowers usually sprout after male pre-flowers.

up and die. They are very delicate and are easily
damaged by light, air, and klutzy hands if moved
or exposed. Extreme care must be exercised
during transplanting.
Like the roots, the stem grows through elonga¬
tion, also producing new buds along the stem.
The central or terminal bud carries growth
upward; side or lateral buds turn into branches
or leaves. The stem functions by transmitting
water and nutrients from the delicate root
hairs to the growing buds, leaves, and flowers.
Sugars and starches manufactured in the leaves
are distributed through the plant via the stem.
This fluid flow takes place near the surface of
the stem. If the stem is bound too tightly by
string or other tie-downs, it will cut the flow of
life-giving fluids, thereby strangling and killing
the plant. The stem also supports the plant with
stiff cellulose, located within the inner walls.
Outdoors, rain and wind push a plant around,
causing much stiff cellulose production to keep
the plant supported upright. Indoors, with no
natural wind or rain present, stiff cellulose
production is minimal, so plants develop weak
stems and may need to be staked up, especially
during flowering.
Once the leaves expand, they start to manu¬
facture food (carbohydrates). Chlorophyll (the
substance that gives plants their green color)
converts carbon dioxide (C02) from the air,
water, and light energy into carbohydrates and
oxygen. This process is called photosynthesis.
It requires water drawn up from the roots,
through the stem, into the leaves where it
encounters carbon dioxide. Tiny breathing pores
called stomata are located on the underside of
the leaf and funnel C02 into contact with the
water. In order for photosynthesis to occur, the
leaf's interior tissue must be kept moist. The
stomata open and close to regulate the flow
of moisture, preventing dehydration. Marijuana
leaves are also protected from drying out by an
outer skin. The stomata also permit the outflow
of water vapor and waste oxygen. The stomata
are very important to the plant's well being and
must be kept clean to promote vigorous growth.

Dirty, clogged stomata would breathe about as
well as you would with a sack over your head!

Pre-Flowering
Cannabis grown from seed dawns pre-flowers
after the fourth week of vegetative growth. They
generally appear between the fourth and sixth
node from the bottom of the plant. Cannabis
plants are normally either all male or all female.
Each sex has its own distinct flowers. Pre-flow¬
ers will be either male or female. Growers
remove and destroy the males (or use them for
breeding stock) because they have low levels
of cannabinoids (THC, CBD, CBN, etc.). Female
plants are cultivated for their high cannabinoid
content.

Once the branch tip has been cut, bottom leaves
are trimmed off before planting the clone, an
exact replica of the mother plant.

Mother Plants
Growers select strong, healthy, potent mother
plants they know are female. Mothers are given
18-24 hours of light daily so they stay in the
vegetative growth stage. Growers cut branch
tips from the mother plants and root them. The
rooted cuttings are called "clones." Cultivating
several strong, healthy mother plants is the
key to having a consistent supply of all-female
clones.

Clones grow a strong root system in 14-21 days
under fluorescent light. Once rooted, they spend
from 7-30 days in vegetative growth.

Cloning
Branch tips are cut and rooted to form clones.
Clones take 10-20 days to grow a strong healthy
root system. Clones are given 18-24 hours of

Once the root system is
established, clones are

tive growth stage before

Cannabis Strains
Technically and legally, all cannabis, wheth¬
er rope or dope, is classified as Cannabis

sativa. Regardless of origin, all cannabis
is considered Cannabis sativa (C. sativa)
under international law. However, accord¬
ing to Hemp Diseases and Pests, Dr. J. M.
McPartland, R. C. Clarke, and D. P. Watson,
CAB International, Cannabis sativa can be
further classified as: Cannabis sativa (= C.

sativa var. sativa), Cannabis indica (= C.
sativa var. indica), Cannabis ruderalis (= C.
sativa var. spondanea), Cannabis afghanica
(= C. sativa var. afghanica). Each has distinct
growth patterns, look, smell, taste, etc.

Cannabis Sativa
Cannabis sativa (= C. sativa var. sati¬
va), originated predominately in Asia, the
Americas, and Africa. Each area of origin
has specific characteristics, but all have the
following general traits: tall, leggy stature
with spacious internodal length, a large
sprawling root system, large narrow-bladed

leaves, and somewhat sparse flowers when
grown indoors under lights. Sativas bloom
several weeks to months later than indica
strains. While good producers outdoors,
often growing to 15 feet (4.5 m) or more,
indoors pure sativa strains often grow too
tall too fast-some up to ten feet in three
months-to be practical for grow room cul¬
tivation. An HID bulb is unable to efficiently
illuminate tall plants, and the yield-per-wattof-light or yield-per-square-foot-of-space is
very low. Mexican, Columbian, Thai, and
Jamaican strains can be very potent, with a
high THC to CBD ratio that produces a soar¬
ing, energetic, "speedy" high. But potency
can also be minimal, with low levels of THC.
Most exported Columbian, Mexican, Thai,

including

the

THC-potent 'Congolese', grow similarly to
Columbian strains, with a tall leggy stat¬
ure, often growing more than 15 feet (4.5
meters) tall with loosely packed buds.
South Africa has major seaports. Sailors
brought Cannabis sativa from many differ¬
ent places and planted it in South Africa.
Consequently, potency of South African
weed can be very high or very low, and
can grow short, tall, leggy, bushy, etc. The
famous 'Durban Poison' yields potent, palegreen, early buds and is the best-known
South African strain.
Asian sativas, including Thai, Vietnamese,
Laotian, Cambodian, and Nepalese, have
diverse growth characteristics and vary sig¬
nificantly in potency. While Thai and other

sativas from the area are often super THCpotent, they are some of the most difficult
to grow indoors and the slowest to mature.
Thai strains produce very light, wispy buds
after flowering for about four months on
plants with large, sprawling branches. Thai,

Cannabis Ruderalis
Cannabis ruderalis (— C. sativa var. spondanea) was first brought to Amsterdam from
Centra! Europe in the early! 980s by the Seed
Bank to enhance their breeding program.
Very similar, if not the same "ruderalis"
plants grow from Minnesota north through
Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada.
C. ruderalis is a short, weedy, scrubby plant
containing very, very little THC, but it starts
the flowering cycle after a few weeks growth.
Photoperiod does not induce flowering in
C. ruderalis. Sometimes confused with more
potent indicas, pure C. ruderalis is true ditch
weed. It yields a headache rather than a
high! Today a few breeders have incorpo¬
rated the early flowering C. ruderalis genes
with other early blooming C. sativa, C. indica,
and C. afghanica.

Cannabis indica plant

Cannabis indica leaf has broader blades than C
sativa leaves; but not as broad as
C. afghanica.
i

p nn

'Lowryder' is one of the few C. ruderalis crosses
that is auto-flowering and THC-potent.

Cannabis Afghanica
Cannabis afghanica (= C. sativa var.
afghanica) originated near present day
Afghanistan. It is quite short, seldom reach¬
ing six feet, with distinctive, broad, dark-green
leaflets and leaves. Dense branching and
short internodes, most often with long leaf
stems (petioles), dominate the profile of
C. afghanica. The most common examples of
pure C. afghanica include the many different
hash plants and Afghani strains. C. afghanica
is cultivated exclusively for drugs with much
of the resin being made into hashish. It is
known for the high cannabinoid content.
Many growers and breeders do not distin¬
guish C. afghanica from C. indica, lumping
them both into the C. indica category.

'Hash Plant', of which there are many, is one of
the classic C. afghanica strains.

One of the first Seed Bank catalogs from 1987
shows a C. ruderalis plant alongside the highway
in Hungary. Many breeders mistakenly hailed
this plant as the "Holy Grail" of cannabis.

C. afghanica has very wide and distinctive leaflets
and leaves.

Seeds
Explosive growth of seed breeders
and legal seed sales in the Netherlands,
the United Kingdom, Canada, France,
Switzerland, Spain, etc., has given way to
more strains of cannabis than ever before.
Most popular strains of cannabis are a com¬
bination of two or more of the following:
C. sativa, C. indica, C. ruderalis, and
C. afghanica. But there are also many seeds
with the genes from just one of the above.
These strains of cannabis are bred to grow
best indoors. Others grow best in green¬
houses, and still others outdoors in specific
climates. See Chapter Sixteen, "Breeding," for
information about hybrid seeds including FI,
F2, F3, etc., hybrids.
A seed contains all the genetic charac¬
teristics of a plant. Seeds are the result of
sexual propagation and contain genes from
each parent, male and female. Some plants,
known as hermaphrodites, bear both male
and female flowers on the same plant. The
genes within a seed dictate a plant's size;
disease and pest resistance; root, stem, leaf,
and flower production; cannabinoid levels;
and many other traits. The genetic makeup
of a seed is the single most important factor
dictating how well a plant will grow under
artificial light or natural sunlight and the lev¬
els of cannabinoids it will produce.
Strong, healthy parents and proper care
yield strong seeds that germinate well.
Strong seeds produce healthy plants and
heavy harvests. Seeds stored too long will
germinate slowly and have a high rate of
failure. Vigorous seeds initiate growth within
seven days or sooner. Seeds that take longer
than a month to germinate could always
be slow and produce less. However, some
seeds take longer to germinate even under
the best conditions.

Germination
Cannabis seeds need only water, heat, and
air to germinate. They do not need extra
hormones to germinate. Seeds sprout with¬

ed, the seeds are carefully planted and grown
to adulthood. By and large, of the ten seeds,
some will be male, some will be weak and
grow poorly, and two or three seeds will grow
into strong, super females. Of these "super"
females, one will be more robust and potent
than her siblings. This super female is selected
to be the mother of countless super clones.
A simple picture of a seed reveals an embryo
containing the genes and a supply of food
wrapped in a protective outer coating. Mature
seeds that are hard, beige to dark brown, and
spotted or mottled have the highest germina¬
tion rate. Soft, pale, or green seeds are usually
immature and should be avoided. Immature
seeds germinate poorly and often produce
sickly plants. Fresh, dry, mature seeds less
than a year old sprout quickly and grow robust
plants.

Temperature
Cannabis seeds grow best at 78°F (25°C).
Low temperatures delay germination.
High temperatures upset seed chemistry
causing poor germination.
Seeds germinate best under the native con¬
ditions where they were grown.
Once germinated, move seedlings to a
slightly cooler growing area, and increase
light levels. Avoid high temperatures and low
light levels, which cause lanky growth.

Seeds need air to germinate. Moist, soggy
growing mediums will cut off oxygen supplies
and the seed will literally drown. Seeds
germinate poorly when planted too deeply.
Tender seedlings do not have sufficient
stored energy to drive through deep layers
of soil when sprouting. Sew seeds twice as
deep as the width of the seed. A 0.125-inch
(3 mm) seed should be planted 0.25-inch (6
mm) deep.
Household water contains enough dis¬
solved solids (food) to nourish seeds through
their first few weeks of life. Although seeds
need only 30-50 ppm of nitrates before they
germinate, any more will disrupt internal
chemistry. Some growers choose to use
distilled water that contains practically no
dissolved solids to germinate seeds. In fact, a
high concentration of dissolved solids (salts)
in the water will actually pull moisture out
of the seed!

lings have sprouted. Some growers wait until

moist rockwool. Keep the rockwool evenly
moist. Once the taproot sprouts, small fuzzy
feeder roots will grow in 12-14 days.
Water penetrates the outer protective shell,
continues to wick in, and activates dormant
hormones that induce germination. Once
a seed receives moisture, there must be a
constant stream of moisture to transport
nutrients, hormones, and water to carry on
life processes. Letting germinated seed suf¬
fer moisture stress now will stunt or stop
seedling growth. The black tip of the root
tells me this is what has happened.
Soggy growing mediums cut oxygen sup¬
plies and cause seeds to drown. Planting
seeds too deeply causes poor germination.

gy to force through too much soil before

sprouting. Plant seeds twice as deep
as the width of the seed, eighth-inch
(4 mm) seed one-quarter (8 mm)
inch deep.
Seeds do not need any extra hor¬
mones to germinate. Average house¬
hold water contains enough dissolved
solids to feed seeds through their first
few weeks of growth. Supplemental
nutrients will disrupt internal chem¬
istry. Some growers prefer to use dis¬
tilled water which contains virtually no
dissolved solids to germinate seeds.
Sow (direct seed) or move the sprout
into a shallow planter, small seed pot,
peat pellet, or rooting cube. Keep the
planting medium evenly moist. Use a
spoon to contain the root ball when
transplanting from a shallow planter.
Peat pellets or root cubes may be
transplanted in two to three weeks
or when the roots show through the
sides. Feed with a dilute, quarterstrength fertilizer solution.
Construct a moisture tent over the
seedling container to help retain even
grow-medium

moisture.

To

build,

place a baggie or piece of cellophane
over the seeded soil. The cover will
keep the humidity and temperature
elevated. Seeds usually need only one
initial watering when under a humid¬
ity tent. Remove the cover as soon as
the first sprout appears aboveground.
Leaving the tent on after seeds sprout
through soil will lead to damping-off
and other problems.
Place planted seeds under an HID
lamp to add dry heat while germinat¬
ing. The heat dries soil, which requires
more frequent watering. Place a heat
pad or soil heating cables below grow¬
ing medium to expedite germination.
Marijuana seeds germinate and sprout
quickest when the soil temperature is

between 78-80°F (24-27.5°C) and the air temper¬
ature is 72-74°F (22-23°C). But stems will stretch
between internodes if temperatures exceed 85°F
(29°C) for long.
Over-watering and under-watering are the big¬
gest obstacles most growers face when germi¬
nating seeds and growing seedlings. Keep the
soil uniformly moist, not waterlogged. Do not let
the growing medium surface dry for long. Keep
it evenly moist. Setting root cubes or planting
flats up on a grate allows good drainage. A shal¬
low flat or planter with a heat pad underneath
may require daily watering, while a deep, onegallon pot will need watering every three days or
more. A properly watered flat of rockwool cubes
needs water every three to five days when sprout¬
ing seeds. When the surface is dry (0.25-inch [7
mm] deep) it is time to water. Remember, there
are few roots to absorb the water early in life, and
they are very delicate.

Stress: any environmental stress tends to
yield more male plants when growing from
seed.
Henk, owner of Dutch Passion Seeds, http://
www.dutch-passion.nl. was kind enough to
allow us to adapt this information from his
archives.
See Chapter Sixteen, "Breeding,” for informa¬
tion on producing feminized seeds.

This germinated seed was allowed to dry out for
a little more than an hour. Notice how the tip
of the root has shriveled. This seemingly small
oversight caused the resulting plant to have a
very slow start in life.

Grow More Females from Seed
Environmental factors start influencing sex
the moment the seedling has three pairs
of true leaves (not counting cotyledons).
Environmental factors that influence sex
determination of cannabis include but are
not limited to:
Increasing the level of nitrogen makes more
female plants. Lower the nitrogen level to
create more male plants. Increase the level
of potassium to increase male tendencies;
lowering the potassium level encourages
female plants. A higher nitrogen level and a
lower potassium level for the first two weeks
increases females.
Low temperatures increase the number
of female plants. Warm temperatures make
more male plants.
High humidity increases the number of
female plants. Low humidity increases male
plants.
Low growing-medium moisture increases
males.
More blue light increases the number of
female plants. More red light increases male
tendencies.
Fewer hours of daylight (e.g. 14 hours)
increases the number of females. Longer days
(e.g. 18 hours) make more male plants.

Seedlings
When a seed sprouts, the white taproot
emerges. Soon afterward, the cotyledon, also
known as seed or seedling leaf, appears. The
seed leaves spread out as the stem elongates.
Within a few days, the first true leaves appear,
and the little plant is now officially a seedling.
This growth stage lasts for three to six weeks.
During seedling growth, a root system grows
rapidly while green aboveground growth is
slow. Water and heat are critical at this point
of development. The new, fragile root system
is very small and requires a small but constant
supply of water and warmth. Too much water
will drown roots, often leading to root rot
and damping-off. Lack of water will cause the
infant root system to dry up. As the seedlings
mature, some will grow faster, stronger, and
appear healthy in general. A little heat now will
help nurture small seedlings to a strong start.
Other seeds will sprout slowly and be weak
and leggy. Cull sickly, weak plants, and focus
attention on the remaining strong survivors.
Seedlings should be big enough to thin out by
the third to fifth week of growth. Thinning out
seedlings is very difficult for growers who pay
$300 dollars for a few seeds!
Seedlings need at least 16 hours of light
daily. They require less intense light now and
grow well under fluorescent tubes for the
first two to three weeks. Compact fluorescent
and HID light can also be used. The compact
fluorescent should be 12-18 inches (30-45
cm) and the HID 3-4 feet (90-120 cm) above
seedlings for best growth.

The seedling stage is over when rapid
foliage growth starts. Rapid growth above
ground is the beginning of the vegetative
growth stage. Plants need more room to
grow; transplanting into a larger container
hastens development.

Seedlings emerging from peat pots develop seed
(cotyledon) leaves before growing their first set
of "true leaves."

Ordering Seeds
Ordering seeds via a magazine ad or the
Internet is commonplace. Many reputable
companies advertise. You are most secure
to order from a company you can contact
by telephone. Speak to a qualified repre¬
sentative who will provide good answers to
your questions. Companies with an e-mail
address and web site are usually okay to
order from, but make sure they answer your
e-mails promptly. Do not be afraid to call sev¬
eral companies and ask them specific ques¬
tions about the strains they sell. If you live in
a country where seeds are illegal, call from a

public telephone and use a calling card. Do
not call the seed company from a telephone
located at a grow house.
Communicating via e-mail can leave a
trail to the computer if you do not use a
proxy server. Learn more about proxy servers
at: http://www.webopedia.eom/TERM/p/
proxy server.html
Some seed companies produce their own
seed and sell it directly to the public. Most
seed producers sell their seed to a reseller
such as the seed companies that can be
found at www.seedbankupdate.com.
Check www.marijuanagrowing.com to find
more information about growing specific
strains. Once you decide on what to order
and have communicated with the company,
you are ready to place your order. Do not
use a credit card if security is a concern.
Companies normally bill your credit card
discreetly and do not charge your credit
card with "Cannabis Seeds." However, if you
decide to use a credit card, discuss the mat¬
ter with the retailer. You may decide to use
an international money order. Cash tells no
tales and leaves no trails. Wrap the cash in
carbon paper so that it cannot be seen. Allow
a reasonable amount of time, two to four
weeks, for the order to arrive. Do not forget
that sometimes packages are lost, misplaced,
and mislabeled.
You may want to set up a "safe address"
such as a PO Box under an assumed name.

Hi

Boy Ramsahai, owner of High Quality Seeds and Black Label Seeds, shows off his high-tech
refrigerator for seed storage. The refrigerator keeps humidity levels below five percent to ensure safe
long-term storage.
Temperature for

Storing Seeds
Store seeds in a cool, dark, dry place. Make
sure to label containers! Some seeds will
remain viable for five years or longer when
stored properly. When 50 percent of the
stored seeds do not germinate, the average
storage life is over. But seeds a year old or
older often take longer to sprout and have a
lower rate of germination.
Seed hormones-ABA, cytokinins, and gibberellins-are primed to respond to moisture,
which is the first signal to germinate. Prevent
moisture from signaling seeds to germinate
by keeping them dry. Small amounts of
moisture in the form of condensation can
give seeds a false start on germination and
cause them to expend all their stored energy.
Avoid moisture levels above five percent to
ensure viable seed. Moisture levels above
five percent will cause germination levels
to decrease rapidly. Seal seed in an airtight
container, and place silicon crystal packages
in the container to absorb excess moisture.

-i

Seeds store for a long time when humidity is less
than 5 percent and temperature is
35-40° F (2-5° C).

Cannabis seeds need enough moisture to
initiate this process within 48 hours.
Hit our site, www.marijuanagrowing.com
for updated information about seeds.

Dry seeds are temperature-sensitive; they
can be disinfected with a short application of
heat. Low temperatures slow internal seed
activity so are best for preserving seeds. You
can use super-cold liquid nitrogen and cryo¬
genics to store seeds for a long time.
Air, once it enters the outer seed shell,
signals seeds to germinate. Viable seeds are
preserved longer when vacuum-packed to
remove all oxygen.
Seeds with a thin, outer protective shell
never truly go dormant, because moisture
and air are always present within. This mois¬
ture and air cause hormone levels to slowly
dissipate. Such seeds do not store well for a
long time.

Seed Pests
Seed pests become active when there is
more than ten percent moisture content.
When the growing medium contains more
than fifteen percent moisture, fungi become
active. Excess fertilizer slows seedling growth
and promotes fungus attacks.
Temperatures from 68-85°F (20-30°C) pro¬
mote Pythium (damping-off) and rhixoctonia fungi. Cannabis seeds grow best at 78°F
(25°C). Most fungi reproduce fastest in a
temperature range of 68-86°F (20-30°C).
Keep a wary eye on problems. Nutrient
overdose burns leaf tips and fringes, which
can look like damping-off to the untrained
eye. Do not fertilize. Applying a fungicide
now will make the problem worse.

TIVE GROWTH

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The

Introduction
The seedling growth stage lasts for about
two to three weeks after seeds have germi¬
nated. Once a strong root system is estab-

lished and foliage growth increases rapidly,
seedlings enter the vegetative growth stage.
When chlorophyll production is full speed
ahead, a vegetative plant will produce as
much green, leafy foliage as it is genetically
possible to manufacture as long as light, C02,
nutrients, and water are not limited. Properly
maintained, marijuana will grow from onehalf to two inches per day. A plant stunted
now could take weeks to resume normal
growth. A strong, unrestricted root system is
essential to supply much needed water and
nutrients. Unrestricted vegetative growth is
the key to a healthy harvest. A plant’s nutrient
and water intake changes during vegetative
growth. Transpiration is carried on at a more
rapid rate, requiring more water. High levels
of nitrogen are needed; potassium, phospho¬
rus, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and trace
elements are used at much faster rates. The
larger a plant gets and the bigger the root
system, the faster the soil will dry out. The
key to strong vegetative growth and a heavy
harvest is supplying roots and plants with the
perfect environment.
Vegetative growth is maintained with 16 or
more hours of light. I used to believe a point
of diminishing returns was reached after 18
hours of light, but further research shows
that vegetative plants grow faster under 24
hours of light. Marijuana will continue veg¬
etative growth a year or longer (theoretically
forever), as long as an 18-hour photoperiod
is maintained.
Cannabis is photoperiodic-reactive; flow¬
ering can be controlled with the light and
dark cycle. This allows indoor horticulturists
to control vegetative and flowering growth.
Once a plant’s sex is determined, it can
become a mother, clone, or breeding male,
and can be harvested or even rejuvenated.
Note: Plants show early male or female
"pre-flowers" about the fourth week of vege¬
tative growth. See "Pre-flowering" in Chapter
Four and the sections here on pre-flowering
male and female.

VEGETATIVE GROWTH
Cloning, transplanting, pruning, and bend¬
ing are all initiated when plants are in the
vegetative growth stage.

Clones and Cloning
Marijuana can be reproduced (propagated)
sexually or asexually. Seeds are the product of
sexual propagation; cuttings or clones are the
result of asexual or vegetative propagation.
In its simplest form, taking a cutting or clone
involves cutting a growing branch tip and
rooting it. Technically, cloning is taking one
cel! of a plant and promoting its growth into
a plant. Marijuana growers commonly refer
to a clone as meaning a branch of a cannabis
plant that has been cut off and rooted.
Cloning reduces the time it takes for a crop
to mature. Productive growers have two
rooms, a vegetative/cloning room, about a
quarter the size of a second room used for
flowering. Smaller vegetative plants take up
less space than older flowering plants. For
example, a 250- or 400-watt metal halide
could easily illuminate vegetative plants and
clones that would fill a flowering room lit by
three 600-watt HP sodiums. If the halide is
turned off, fluorescent and compact fluores¬
cent lamps are more economical and work
well to root clones.
Combine eight-week flowering/harvest
cycles with continuous cloning to form a
perpetual harvest. One easy-to-implement
scenario is to take two clones every four
days, and harvest one ripe female every
other day. Every time a plant is harvested,
one or two rooted clones are moved from a
constantly supplied vegetative room into the
flowering room. This regimen gives a grower
30 flowering clones that are on a 91-day
schedule. It takes 91 days from the time a
clone is cut from the mother plant until the
day it is harvested. Using this schedule, a
grower would have 30 clones, 10 vegetative
plants, and 30 flowering plants growing at all
times. See chart next page.

Swiss retailers sold clones over-the-counter until
the law changed in 2001. Now, Swiss growers
have gone underground.

A sea of clones share all genetic characteristics.
They will all grow up to look like their mothers.

Induce clones to flower when they are four
to twelve inches tall to make most efficient
use of HID light. Artificial light diminishes
to the square of the distance, which means
that foliage four feet away from the bulb
receives one fourteenth as much light as if it
were one foot away! Foliage that is shaded
or receives less light grows slowly and looks
spindly.
Short crops of clones in small containers
are much easier to move and maintain than
big plants in big containers. Short clones
are also easy and efficient to grow in green¬
houses and outdoors.
Well-illuminated, strong clones grow fast
and have less chance of being affected
by pests and diseases. Fast-growing clones
develop more quickly than spider mites can
reproduce. By the time a spider mite infesta¬
tion is noticed and sprayed, the plants are a
few weeks from harvest. Clones are also easy
to submerge in a miticide when small.
Experiments with clones are consistent and
easy to control. Genetically identical clones
respond the same to different stimuli, such
as fertilizer, light, bending, etc. After experi¬
menting on several crops of clones from the
same mother, a grower has a very good idea
what it takes to make them grow well.

Mother Plants

Two 'Queen Mother' plants will soon bear many,
many clones.

Any plant can be cloned, regardless of age
or growth stage. Take clones from mother
plants that are at least two months old. Plants
cloned before they are two months old may
develop unevenly and grow slowly. Clones
taken from flowering plants root quickly but
require a month or longer to revert back to
vegetative growth. Such rejuvenated clones
occasionally flower prematurely, and buds
are more prone to pest and disease attacks.
Any female can become a mother. She can
be grown from seed or be a clone of a clone.
I interviewed several growers who made
clones of clones more than 20 times! That

§181

is, clones (C-1) were taken from the original
female grown from seed. These clones were
grown in the vegetative stage, and clones
(C-2) were taken from the first clones (C-1).
Blooming was induced in (C-1) two weeks
later and (C-2), grown in the vegetative
stage. Then, clones (C-3) were taken from
the second clones (C-2). This same grow¬
ing technique is still going on with clones of
clones well past (C-20) and there has been
no apparent breakdown in the potency or
the vigor of the clone. However, if mothers
suffer stress, they produce weak clones.
Mothers that are forced to flower and revert
back to vegetative growth not only yield less,
they are stressed and confused. Clones that
grow poorly are generally the result of poor,
unsanitary cloning practices.
A clone is an exact genetic replica of the
mother plant. Each mother's cell carries a
DNA blueprint of itself. Radiation, chemicals,
and poor cultural practices can damage this
DNA. Unless damaged, the DNA remains
intact.
A female plant will reproduce 100 per¬
cent females, all exactly like the mother.
When grown in the exact same environment,
clones from the same mother look alike. But
the same clones subjected to distinct envi¬
ronments in different grow rooms will often
look different.
A six-month old plant produces more cannabinoids than a one-month old plant. By
cloning, a horticulturist is planting a THCpotent plant that will continue to grow in
potency at a very rapid rate. A month-old
rooted clone acts exactly like a four-monthold plant and can be induced easily to flower
with a 12-hour photoperiod.
Keep several mother plants in the vegeta¬
tive stage for a consistent source of cloning
stock. Start new mothers from seed every
year. Give mother plants 18-24 hours of light
per day to maintain fast growth. For best
results, give mothers about ten percent less
nitrogen, because less nitrogen promotes
rooting in clones.

vigor" which means that this cross will grow

susceptible to pest and disease problems.
Always start with the best mothers you
can find. A mother plant yields clones in her
image. If the mother plant lacks potency,
harvest weight, or is not pest and disease
resistant, the clone shares her drawbacks.
These weaknesses are compounded when
growing only one strain. An unchecked pest
or disease infestation could wipe out the
entire crop.
Some growers have a difficult time learning
to make clones. If this is the case, continue
to work through the little problems one step
at a time, and you will learn. Some people
have a little longer learning curve when

Cloning is the most traumatic incident
cannabis plants can experience. Clones go
through an incredible transformation when
they change from a severed growing tip to a
rooted plant. Their entire chemistry changes.
The stem that once grew leaves must now
grow roots in order to survive. Clones are at
their most tender point in life now.
Clones quickly develop a dense system of
roots when stems have a high carbohydrate
and low nitrogen concentration. Build carbo¬
hydrate levels by leaching the growing medi¬
um with copious quantities of water to flush
out nutrients. The growing medium must
drain very well to withstand heavy leach¬
ing without becoming waterlogged. Reverse
foliar feeding will leach nutrients from leaves,
especially nitrogen. To reverse foliar feed, fill
a sprayer with clean water and mist mother
heavily every morning for three or four days.
Older leaves may turn light green; growth
slows as nitrogen is used and carbohydrates
build. Carbohydrate and hormonal content is
highest in lower, older, more mature branch-

cloning is involved. Take five to ten practice
clones before making a serious cloning. You
can also work with strains that are easy to
clone.

Plants that are easy to clone
Most Skunk and Indica strains are easy to
clone.
Growers and sick plants cause most clone
rooting problems. Weak plants that lack
vigor provide slow-rooting weak clones. Poor
growing conditions also affect clone strength.

Harder to clone:
Ruderalis Indica and Ruderalis Skunk do
not make suitable mother plants due to their
auto-flowering capability. Outdoor strains
with a slight tendency to pre-sex in an 18hr
photoperiod include: Early Girl, Early Skunk
and many others. Check with seed compa¬
nies for details. But early flowering does not
exclude them as mother plants.

Clones from lower branches root the easiest
because they contain more of the proper
hormones.

es. See drawing on previous page. A rigid
branch that folds over quickly when bent is a
good sign of high carbohydrate content.
Hormone content is different in different
parts of a plant. Root growth hormones are
concentrated near the base of the plant close
to the main stem. This is the oldest portion of
the plant and is where most root hormones
are located. The top of the plant contains
older hormones; cuttings taken from this
part root slowly.

While rooting, clones require a minimum of
nitrogen and increased levels of phosphorus
to promote root growth. Sprays should be
avoided during rooting as they compound
cloning stress. Given good instruction and
a little experience, most growers achieve a
consistent, 100 percent clone survival rate.
Large cuttings with large stems packed
with starch grow roots slower than small
clones with small stems. The excess starch in
moist substrate also attracts diseases. Thin¬
stemmed clones have fewer reserves (accu¬
mulated starch), but they only need enough
reserve energy to initiate root growth.
Small clones with few leaves root faster
than big cuttings with many leaves. At first
leaves contain moisture, but after a few days,
the stem is no longer able to supply enough
moisture to the leaves, and the clone suffers
stress. A small amount of leaf space is all

that is necessary for photosynthesis to supply

Precautions
An embolism is a bubble of air that gets
trapped in the hole in the stem. Embolisms
occur when you take big clones and lay
them on the counter before placing in water
or a growing medium. When an embolism
happens, fluid flow stops, and clones die.
After taking cuttings, immediately dip them
in water or a growing medium to prevent
air from getting trapped in the hollow stems.
Eliminate the threat of an embolism by tak¬
ing cuttings under water.
Clones root well within a pH range of five
to six. Aeroponic clone gardens normally do
best with a pH of five to five and a half. Most
diseases grow poorly below these pH levels.
Always make sure there is plenty of air in
the rooting medium; this will stimulate root
growth.
Do not kill clones with kindness and fertil¬
izer. At best, giving clones an excess dose
of fertilizer causes rooting to be delayed. In
fact, a good dose of ammonium nitrate, a
common fertilizer, will stop root hairs from
growing.
If an infestation occurs, apply aerosol pyrethrum. Remember, all pesticides, natural or
not, are phytotoxic. Spraying cuttings is a bad
idea in general. If you must use sprays, use
natural organic sprays, apply them when it is
cool, and keep their use to a minimum.
Use anti-desiccant sprays sparingly, if at all,
and only if a humidity dome is unavailable.
Anti-desiccant sprays clog stomata and can
impair root growth in clones.
Do not over-water clones. Keep the medium
evenly moist, and do not let it get soggy.
Any kind of stress disrupts hormones and
slows rapid growth.
Keep the cloning area clean. Do not take
clones where fungus spores and diseases
are hiding! Pythium is the worst! Pythium
flourishes in high temperatures and exces¬
sive moisture. Mites, whiteflies, thrips, etc.,
love weak tender clones. Remove infested

clones from the room. Cooler conditions,
65-78°F (18-25°C), slow mite and fungal
spore reproduction and allow you to avert
an infestation.

Rooting Hormones
Root-inducing hormones speed plant pro¬
cesses. When the stem of a cutting develops
roots, it must transform from producing
green stem cells to manufacturing undiffer¬
entiated cells and, finally, to fabricating root
cells. Rooting hormones hasten growth of
undifferentiated cells. Once undifferentiated,
cells quickly transform into root cells. Three
substances that stimulate undifferentiated
growth include napthalenaecetic acid (NAA),
indolebutyric acid (IBA) and 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 3 DPA). Commercial
rooting hormones contain one, two, or all
of the above synthetic ingredients and often
include a fungicide to help prevent damp¬
ing-off.
Rooting hormones are available in liquid,
gel, or powder form. Liquid and gel types
penetrate stems evenly and are the most
versatile and consistent. Powdered rooting
hormones adhere inconsistently to stems,
penetrate poorly, spur uneven root growth,
and yield a lower survival rate.

Warning! Some products are not recommended for use with edible plants. Read the label carefully before deciding
to use a product.

Liquid rooting hormones can be mixed
in different concentrations. Always mix the
most dilute concentration for softwood cut¬
tings. Apply any rooting hormone containing
I BA only once. If exceeded in concentration
or duration, IBA applications impair root for¬
mation. As soon as cuttings are taken, clones
start dispatching rooting hormones to the
wound. They arrive in full force in about a
week. The artificial rooting hormone fills the

need until natural hormones take over.
Give cuttings a 5-15 second dip in concen¬
trated solutions of IBA and NAA, 500-20,000
ppm. With a quick dip, stems evenly absorb
the concentrated hormone.
Relatively new to the market, gels have
caught on everywhere. They are easy to use
and practical, but are not water soluble.
Once applied, gels hold and stay with the
stem longer than liquids or powders.

'immm

Rooting powders are a mixture of talc and
IBA and/or NAA and are less expensive than
liquids or geis. To use, roll the moistened end
of your cutting in the powder. Apply a thick,
even coat. To avoid contamination, pour a
small amount into a separate container, and
throw away any excess. Tap or scrape excess
powder off the cutting; excess hormones can
hinder root growth. Make a hole bigger than
the stem in the rooting medium. If the hole
is too small, the rooting powder gets scraped
off upon insertion.
You can also spray clones with a single
foliar spray of dilute IBA (50-90 ppm). Be
careful to spray just enough to cover leaves.
Spray should not drip off leaves. An IBA over¬
dose slows growth, makes leaves dwarf, and
could even kill the clone.
Some growers soak their cuttings in a dilute
solution (20-200 ppm IBA and/or NNA) for
24 hours. But I have seen few growers use
this time-consuming technique.
To determine the rooting hormone con¬
centration in parts per million, multiply the
percentage listed by the manufacturer by
10,000. For example, a product with 0.9%
IBA contains 9000 ppm IBA.
An all-natural, root-inducing substance is
willow (tree) water. The substance in all wil¬
low trees that promotes rooting is unknown,
but repeated experiments have proven wil¬
low water promotes about 20 percent more
roots than plain water. This willow water is
mixed with commercial rooting hormones
for phenomenal results.
To make willow water rooting compound,
find any willow tree and remove some of
this year's branches that are about one
and a half inches in diameter. Remove the
leaves, and cut the branches into one-inch
lengths. Place one-inch willow sticks on end,
so a lot of them fit in a water glass or quart
jar. Fill the jar with water, and let it soak for
24 hours. After soaking, pour off the willow
water, and use it for rooting hormone. Soak
the marijuana clones in the willow water for
24 hours, then plant in rooting medium. If
using a commercial liquid rooting hormone,

Grow More Roots

Split the stem of clones to expose more of
the cambium layer just under the "skin" of
the stem. It is the only place that generates
new roots.

Avoid problems:
Keep the work area clean. Wash work sur¬
faces and tools before starting.
Have grow medium ready.
Prepare mother plant (scion).
Take clones.
Store unused clone.
Insert (stick) cutting in growing medium or
aeroponics system.
Place clones under humidity tent.
Look for root growth.
Transplant when roots emerge from root
cube or medium.
Harden-off by gradually exposing to new
environment.

Exposing the cambium layer causes many
roots to grow there. Lightly scraping away
the outer layer of the stem to expose only
the cambium allows hormones to concen¬
trate where roots start. Splitting the clones'
stem exposes more surface area to grow
roots. Both practices increase the number
of healthy roots, but rooting time is a few
days longer.
After the cutting has been trimmed and
scraped, dip the bare stem into a rooting
hormone. Now it is ready to "stick" into the
substrate.

VEGETATIVE GROWTH
Before Making Clones
Making clones or cuttings is the most
efficient and productive means of cannabis
propagation for small growers, both indoors
and out. Once females have been distin¬
guished, you are ready to practice the simple,
productive art and science of cloning.
Disinfect all tools and working surfaces to
kill bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other diseas¬
es already present. Use sharp scissors, razor,
or razor blade dipped in alcohol, vinegar, or
bleach (five to ten percent solution). Wash
your hands thoroughly beforehand.
Make sure to have all cloning supplies
within arm's reach-rooting cubes, hormone,
razor or scissors, humidity dome, etc.-before
you start to take clones.

Make a 45-degree cut across the stem to cut the
clone.

Cloning: Step-by-Step
Step One: Choose a mother plant that is
at least two months old. Some varieties give
great clones even when pumped up with
hydroponics and fertilizer. If a variety is dif¬
ficult to clone, leach the soil with two gallons
of water for each gallon of soil every morning
for a week before taking clones. Drainage
must be good. Or mist leaves heavily with
plain water every morning. Both practices
help wash out nitrogen. Do not add fertil¬
izer.
Step Two: With a sharp blade, make a
45-degree cut across firm, healthy 0.1250.25-inch-wide (3-6 mm) branches, two to
four inches (3-5 cm) in length. Take care not
to smash the end of the stem when making
the cut. Trim off two or three sets of leaves
and growth nodes so the stem can fit into
the soil. There should be at least two sets
of leaves above the soil line and one or two
sets of trimmed nodes below ground. When
cutting, make the slice halfway between the
sets of nodes. Immediately place the cut
end in water. Store cut clones in water while
making more clones.

Hold cut clones in a glass of water until you are
ready to dip in hormone and plant.

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE

Dip trimmed stem into the rooting gel
or liquid hormone. Make sure stem
is covered with the proper amount of
rooting hormone.

Step Three: Rockwool and Oasis™ root cubes are
convenient and easy to maintain and transplant. Fill
small containers or nursery flats with coarse, washed
sand, fine vermiculite, soilless mix, or, if nothing else
is available, fine potting soil. Saturate the substrate
with water. Use an unsharpened pencil, chop stick,
nail, etc., to make a hole in the rooting medium-a
little larger than the stem. The hoie should stop about
one-half inch (1.5 cm) from the bottom of the con¬
tainer toallow for root growth.
Place a tray containing rooting cubes or plugs into
a standard nursery rooting flat. If none exist, make
holes through three-fourths of the cube for clone
stems.
Fill rockwool tray with water, pH 5-6. Always use
strong plastic trays.

Place the stem covered with rooting
hormone into the root cube.

Pinch the top of the root cube so that
growing medium is in full contact with
the stem.

Grow clones until they are well-rooted. Always remember
to label clones when planting.

VEGETATIVE GROWTH
Step Four: Use a rooting hormone, and mix
(if necessary) just before using. For liquids,
use the dilution ratio for softwood cuttings.
Swirl each cutting in the hormone solution
for 5-15 seconds. Place the cuttings in the
hole in the rooting medium. Pack rooting
medium gently around the stem. Gel and
powder root hormones require no mixing.
Dip stems in gels as per instructions or roll
the stem in the powder. When planting, take
special care to keep a solid layer of hormone
gel or powder around the stem when gently
packing soil into place.
Step Five: Lightly water until the surface
is evenly moist. Keep cuttings moist at all
times. Clones have no roots to bring water
to leaves. Water arrives from leaves and the
cut stem until roots can supply it. Water as
needed to keep growing medium evenly
moist. Do not let it get soggy.
Step Six: Clones root fastest with 18-24
hours of fluorescent light. If clones must
be placed under an HID, set them on the
perimeter of the garden so they receive less
intense light; or shade them with a cloth or
screen. A fluorescent tube six inches (18 cm)
above clones or a 400-watt metal halide
4-6 feet (1.2-1.8) away supplies the perfect
amount of light for clones to root. Cool white
fluorescents (or a combination of warm and
cool white) are excellent for rooting.

Humidity domes fit over flats of clones to retain
humidity. The domes on the right are covered
with lightweight Agronet to lower light on new
clones.

m

Strong clone in an aeroponic clone garden has

Step Seven: Clones root fastest when
humidity levels are 95-100 percent the first
two days and gradually reduced to 8085 percent during the following week. A
humidity tent will help keep humidity high.
Construct the tent out of plastic bags, rigid
plastic, or glass. Remember to leave open¬
ings for air to flow in and out so little clones
can breathe. If practical, mist clones several
times a day as an alternative to the humid¬
ity tent. Remove any sick, rotting, or dead
foliage.
Cut leaves in half to lower transpiration
surface and to keep them from overlapping.
Moisture that could foster fungus is often
trapped between overlapping leaves. Keep
the grow medium evenly moist so there
is enough moisture to prevent cut leaves
from bleeding out plant sugars that attract
diseases.
Step Eight: Clones root faster when the
growing medium is a few degrees warmer
than the ambient air temperature. A warmer
substrate increases underground chemical
activity, and lower air temperature slows
transpiration. For best results, keep the root¬
ing medium at 75-80°F (24-27°C). Growing
medium temperatures above 85°F (29°C)
will cause damage. Keep the air temperature
5-10°F (3-5.5°C) cooler than the substrate.
A warmer growing medium coupled with
cooler ambient temperature slows diseases
and conserves moisture. Misting clones with
water also cools foliage and slows transpira¬
tion to help traumatized clones retain mois¬
ture unavailable from nonexistent roots.
Put clones in a warm place to adjust air
temperature and use a heat pad, heating
cables, or an incandescent light bulb below
rooting cuttings.
Step Nine: Some cuttings may wilt but
regain rigidity in a few days. Clones should
look close to normal by the end of the week.
Cuttings that are still wilted after seven days
may root so slowly that they never catch
up with others. Cull them out, or put them

VEGETATIVE GROWTH

-____

back into the cloning chamber to grow more
roots.
Step Ten: In one to three weeks, cuttings
should be rooted. Signals they have rooted
include yellow leaf tips, roots growing out
drain holes, and vertical growth of the
clones. To check for root growth in flats or
pots, carefully remove the root ball and clone
to see if it has good root development. For
best results, do not transplant clones until a
dense root system is growing out the sides
and bottom of rooting cubes.
Cuttings are always strong and healthylooking after you take them. After five or
six days, leaves may start to change color.
Leaves stay small and often turn a deeper
shade of green. After about a week, lower
leaves may start to yellow if their nutrient
levels dissipate.
A week after being taken, clones' stems
will develop stubby callused roots called
primordia. The primordia are semi-transpar¬
ent to white and should look healthy. Clones
produce very little green growth during this
process. Once the root and vascular trans¬
port system is in place and working prop¬
erly, clones are able to experience explosive
growth with the proper care.
Rooting clones can handle increasingly
more light as roots grow. Move the fluo¬
rescent lamps to two to four inches above
plants when roots form. Fertilize with a
mild fertilizer solution when all clones have
started vegetative growth.
Any sign of slime, pests, or disease means
there are problems, and clones should be
removed from the garden.
Transplant only the strongest, well-rooted
clones. (See "Transplanting.") Slow-rooting
clones should be kept in the cloning cham¬
ber or culled out Do not move clones below
bright light until they have fully developed
root systems. Once transplanted, clones are
ready to harden-off (see "Transplanting").

This cutting needs to grow a bigger root
system before transplanting.

Swiss cloning expert is removing the tip of a
mother plant to clone in an agar solution. Such
clones are easy to maintain for long periods.

Set up a vegetative pre-growing area that is lit
with an HID or bright compact fluorescent lamp
for the rooted clones. Place them in this area to
let them grow the first week or two of vegeta¬
tion. This area needs to be just big enough to
accommodate plants from the time they are a
few inches tall until they are about a foot tall and
ready to be moved into the flowering room.

Air layering
There is a good sequence of air layering
in Marijuana Botany, by Robert C. Clarke.
To date, I have never seen anybody use this
technique. It is interesting, but normally not
necessary. Cannabis is easy to root or clone.

Cloning for Sex
Determine plant sex accurately, 100 per¬
cent of the time, by "cloning for sex." To
clone for sex, take two cuttings (in case one
dies) from each parent plant in question. Use
waterproof labels and an indelible marker
to identify sets of clones and corresponding
parents.
Give rooting clones a 12-hour light/dark
regimen. After a 12-hour day, set clones in
a dark closet, or place a box over them. The
dark period must be total and uninterrupted
to induce flowering. Clones usually show
sex within two weeks. Cull out all males
except those used for breeding. Flower little
females, and keep their mothers growing
under 18-24 hours of light.
Growers with only one room root clones
in a nursery flat, and cover it with a light¬
tight cardboard box for 12 hours every night.
Remove the cardboard box after the lights
go out to increase air circulation and ventila¬
tion.

Clones from a Flowering Female
You can clone a favorite flowering plant,
but it is difficult. Clones take longer to root,
and results are not always the best. Powerful
flowering hormones must be reversed, and
rooting hormone signals must be sent. Now
is the time to give plants 24 hours of light to
signal them to grow.
Cut clones from the lower green branch
tips. Cut a one to two-inch-long (3-5 cm)
stem. Trim off flowers and lower leaves.
Keep two or three green leaves. If leaves
have yellowed, survival chances diminish
exponentially.

You can take clones from flowering plants and
revert them to vegetative growth once rooted.
The earlier in the flowering stage cuttings
are taken, the more rapid the rooting and
the re-vegetation rate. Once a plant reaches
the senescence point, growth hormones
have dissipated, leaving not enough to initi¬
ate roots.

Storing Clones
To store cuttings for later use, wrap recently
cut and trimmed stems in a damp cloth or
paper towel. Put the wrapped clones into
a plastic bag, and store in the refrigerator.
On a daily basis, remove the water that con¬
denses inside the bag in the cool refrigerator.
Keep the temperature above 40°F (5°C).
Temperatures below this level may cause
plant cells to rupture. Cuttings should last in
the refrigerator for about three weeks.

product, is a gel that allows cut clones to root
and be held until they are needed.

When plants are too big for their containers,
they must be transplanted to continue rapid
growth. Inhibited, cramped root systems
grow sickly, stunted plants. Signs of root
bound plants include slow, sickly growth and
branches that develop with more distance
between limbs. Severely root-bound plants
tend to grow straight up with few branches
that stretch beyond the sides of the pot. To
check for root-bound symptoms, remove a
plant from its pot to see if roots are deeply
matted on the bottom or surrounding the
sides of the pot.
When growing short plants that reach full
maturity in 90 days, there is little need for
containers larger than three gallons (11 L).
Large mother plants will need a large pot if
they are kept for more than a few months.

Dip rooted clones
into a miticidal/
fungicidal solution before transplanting and
before moving into the flowering room.
Mix a miticidal/fungicidal dip (I like Einstein
Oil) to disinfect clones before sticking them
in the growing medium. Fill a container with
low pH water (5-6) and add a natural fungi¬
cide such as hydrogen peroxide in a two per¬
cent solution. Or include a ten percent mix of
chlorine or vinegar. Do not mix vinegar and

chlorine! The resulting gas is hazardous.
See "Transplanting."

In this container, roots are growing mainly
around the sides and along the bottom. This
plant is ready to be transplanted.

VEGETATIVE GROWTH
Transplant into the same type or similar
growing medium; otherwise, a water pres¬
sure differential could develop between the
different mediums, which slows water move¬
ment and causes slow root growth. Starting
seeds and clones in root cubes or peat pots
makes them easy to transplant. Set the cube
or peat pot in a hole in the growing medium,
and make sure growing medium is in firm
contact. Remember to keep root cubes and
substrates evenly moist after transplanting.
Transplanting is the second most traumatic
experience after cloning. It requires special
attention and manual dexterity. Tiny root
hairs are very delicate and may easily be
destroyed by light, air, or clumsy hands.
Roots grow in darkness, in a rigid, secure
environment. When roots are taken out of
contact with the soil for long, they dry up
and die.
Transplanting should involve as little distur¬
bance to the root system as possible. Water
helps the soil pack around roots and keeps
them from drying out. Roots need to be in
constant contact with moist soil in order to
supply water and food to the plant.
After transplanting, photosynthesis and
chlorophyll production are slowed, as are
water and nutrient absorption via roots.
Transplant late in the day so transplant¬
ed plants will have all night to recover.
Transplants need subdued light, so foliage
can grow at the rate roots are able to supply
water and nutrients. Give new transplants fil¬
tered, less-intense light for a couple of days.
If there is a fluorescent lamp handy, move
transplants under it for a couple of days
before moving them back under the HID or
outdoors to harden-off.
Ideally, plants should be as healthy as pos¬
sible before being traumatized by transplant¬
ing. But, transplanting a sick, root-bound

plant shock. Plants need a few days to settle
in and re-establish a solid flow of fluids from
the roots throughout the plant. When trans¬
planted carefully and disturbed little, there
will be no signs of transplant shock or wilt.
Double potting is a simple transplanting
technique that disturbs roots very little. To
double pot a plant, cut the bottom out of a
root-bound pot, and set on top of another
bigger pot of soil. Roots grow down into

Step Five: Carefully place the root ball in

down.
Step Six: Backfill around the root ball.
Gently, but firmly, place soil into contact with
root ball.
Step Seven: Water with half-strength fer¬
tilizer containing Trichoderma bacteria or
Vitamin Bj. Soil should be saturated-not
waterlogged-and drain freely. If rooting cube
and new substrate are not identical, pay
special attention to moisture levels. Let rock¬
wool dry out enough so that roots penetrate
new growing medium in search of moisture.
Step Eight: Place new transplants on the
perimeter of the HID garden or under a
screen to subdue sunlight for a couple of
days. Once transplants look strong, move
them under full light.
Step Nine: Fertilize soilless mixes after
transplanting with a complete hydropon¬
ic fertilizer that contains soluble chelated
nutrients. New potting soil usually supplies
enough nutrients for a couple of weeks
before supplemental fertilization is neces¬
sary.

Seedlings and clones can also be trans¬
planted directly into a three- to five-gallon
(11-19 L) pot, a system which requires fewer
containers and involves less work and less
possible plant stress. The larger volume of
soil holds water and nutrients longer and
requires less frequent watering. When clones
and seedlings are transplanted directly into a
five-gallon (19 L) container, the roots grow
down, out, and around the container walls
and bottom. In fact, the majority of roots
grow out of the soil and form a layer behind
the container wall.
To encourage roots to develop a dense
compact system, transplant just before they
have outgrown their container. Transplanting
a well-rooted clone in a root cube into a
four-inch (10-cm) pot and transplanting the
four-inch (10-cm) pot into a three-gallon
(11 L) pot or grow bag causes roots to devel¬
op a more extensive system in a small ball of
growing medium. Successful transplanting
causes minimal stress. Most marijuana crops
are in the ground for such a short time that
bungled transplanting costs valuable recu¬
peration time and loss in production.
Transplant clones and seedlings into raised
beds and large planter boxes directly from
four-inch (10-cm) pots. As many as 20 plants
can be transplanted into a 24 x 24 x 12-inch
(61 x 61 x 30 cm) planter, but six to twelve
plants will yield about the same dry weight
of buds. Once plants start crowding and
shading one another, bend stems outward
and tie them to a trellis attached to the
planter. Large planters require less mainte¬

nance. The larger mass of soil retains water
and nutrients much longer and more evenly.
One downside is that all plants must receive
the same water and diet.
Three-gallon (11 L) containers are the ideal
size for two- to three-foot-tall (60-90 cm)
plants. Larger pots are usually unnecessary
because plants grow no longer than a week
or two in the vegetative stage and six to ten
weeks flowering. Smaller three-gallon (11
L) pots are easy to move and handle. Roots
also grow less during flowering. By the time
a plant is potbound, it is ready to harvest.
I used to recommend up to a five-gallon
(19 L) container for plants that are harvested
after 90 total days of life. I now believe this is
a waste. While the smaller containers require
daily watering, they produce harvests com-

Hardening-off
Hardening-off is the process of toughening-up clones and seedlings. During the
rooting process, leaves supplied much of
the moisture for the clone. Now, healthy
white new roots are supplying moisture to
the clone. Check for root damage. Brown
roots are rotting and lack oxygen. Thin
hair-like dark roots are dried out. Once
damaged, roots remain damaged. New
roots must grow to replace damaged roots.
Cull out any clones with damaged roots,
because they will grow slowly. The protec¬
tive wax coating must also grow back on
leaves. It is best to acclimate rooted clones
to the grow room over the course of a
week. Gradually hardening-off clones will
assure they suffer a minimum of stress and
continue to grow rapidly.
Harden off the strong ones, and intro¬
duce them to the real world-the grow
room where they will see photosynthetically active response (PAR) at full value and
nutrients that make their cells quiver. Now
is the time to pre-grow clones before plac¬
ing them into the flowering room.
Foliage loses its protective wax coating
when it is pampered during cloning, so it
is very tender now. New roots must start to
transport water via the stems to the leaves.

These beautiful little seedlings were started
indoors under a fluorescent lamp. The grower
moves them outdoors for a few hours every
day to harden-off and acclimate to the outdoor
environment.
The roots and moisture-transport system
start to work on strong, healthy clones
first. Clones that lag behind now should
be tossed out, because they will always
be slow. You can let them root longer and
not transplant them until adequate roots
develop.

parable to those of five-gallon
(19 L) containers.
Mother plants are much
larger, grow longer, and can
require containers up to 30 gal¬
lons (115 L) in size. However,
mother plants grow quite well
in five or ten-gallon (19-38
L) hydroponic containers for
a year or longer. If you plan to
keep a mother plant for more
than a few months, grow it
hydroponically in its own con¬
tainer for best results.

Pruning and Bending
Pruning and bending a plant redirects
growth hormones. Pruning affects the plant
more drastically than bending. Selective
pruning and bending allow us to manipu¬
late auxin hormone levels in branch and
flower tips. Removing or bending a branch or
branch tip causes hormonal balances to shift.
Cutting the meristem (top growth tip) of a
cannabis plant will diffuse auxins and cause
greater concentrations in lower branch tips.
Bending a growing tip changes hormone
concentrations less than pruning.

There are a few basic techniques to
pruning marijuana, including:
Prune off the
top of the plant
below the first
set or two of
branches to
drive hormones
to lower
branches.
Pruning off
more of the
main stem will
increase the
effect.

Pruning
Always use clean instruments when prun¬
ing. A straight razor, single-edge razor blade,
a sharp pair of pruners, or a pair of scissors
all work well. Sanitize clippers and blades
between cuts by dipping in rubbing alcohol.
Use indoor pruners only in the indoor gar¬
den. Pruners used outdoors have everything
from spider mites to fungus spores on them.
If outdoor clippers must be used, dip in rub¬
bing alcohol to sterilize before making cuts.
After pruning, the open wound invites dis¬
eases and pests. Wash your hands and tools
before and after pruning. Make cuts at a 45degree angle to discourage moisture from
sitting on wounds.
Avoid pruning up to a month before induc¬
ing flowering. Since pruning diffuses floral
hormones, flowering is retarded. If heavily
pruned shortly before flowering, peak matu¬
ration is delayed for a week or longer. It takes
a month or longer for hormones to build up
to pre-pruning concentrations.
Leave leaves alone! Removal of healthy
leaves hacks up a healthy plant. Removing
large fan or shade leaves DOES NOT make
plants more productive even though this
practice supplies more light to small leaves
and growing tips. Plants need all their leaves
to produce the maximum amount of chloro¬
phyll and food. Removing leaves slows chlo-

stunts its growth. Stress is a growth inhibitor.
Remove only dead leaves or leaves that are
more than 50 percent damaged.
Remove spindly branches and growth that
is not collecting light energy, including dead

concentrates auxins in upper branches which
forces growth upwards. Cut lower branches
off cleanly at the stem so no stub is left to rot
and attract pests and diseases. If you must
harvest a little smoke prematurely, remov¬
ing a few lower branches will diminish the
harvest the least.
Pruning out spindly branches and growth
inside plants opens up the interior and pro¬
vides more and better air circulation. It also
allows light to reach deeper inside plants.
Not pruning has several advantages. Floral
hormones are allowed to concentrate in tips
of branches causing buds to grow stronger
and denser. Unpruned plants are crammed
into a small area. Crowded plants have less
space to bush out laterally and tend to grow
more upright. Clones are set into the flower¬
ing room after 1-30 days in the vegetative

room. All the little clones are packed tightly
together in three-gallon pots. Each one of the
plants is taking up the minimum amount of
space for the minimum amount of time to
produce the maximum amount of marijuana.
Light is much more intense, and the entire
plant grows flower tops with few fan leaves.
Most successful growers do not prune at
all, especially if growing a short clone crop
that is only two to three feet (61-91 cm)
tall. Short clone crops require no pruning
to increase light to bottom leaves or to alter
their profile. "No pruning" is the easiest
and most productive method when growing
short crops.
Pinching back or pruning tops (branch
tips) causes the two growing shoots just
below the cut to grow stronger and bigger.
This increases the number of top or main
buds. Pruning tops also diffuses floral hor¬
mones. These hormones (auxins) prevent
the lateral buds from growing very fast. All
lower branches develop more rapidly when
the terminal bud is removed. The further a
branch is from hormones at the plant tip, the
less effect the auxins have.
To pinch back a branch tip, simply snip
it off below the last set or two of leaves.
Pinching off tender growth with your fin¬
gers helps seal the wound and is often less
damaging to plants than cutting. When the
main stem is pinched back, side and lower
growth is stimulated. When all the tops are
pinched back, lower growth is encouraged.
Continually pinching back, as when taking
clones from a mother, causes many more
little branches to form below the pruned tips.
Eventually, the plant is transformed into a
hedge-like shape. Most growers do not pinch
plants back, because it diminishes the yield
of prime, dense tops; but it may not affect
the overall weight of dried smoke.
Supercropping is a form of pinching back
or pruning branch tips. We are not sure who
or when the term or buzzword was coined.
We do know that there are several differ¬

ent versions of supercropping "invented" by
innovative growers.
Supercropping can also incorporate FIM
pruning which is explained below. It can be
combined with bending, too. Some people

go to the point of mutilating plants by break¬
ing branches a few inches below main buds.
Removing healthy leaves so that "budding
sites get more light" is also practiced by
some supercroppers. See "Stress" in this
chapter for more information.
Pruning all the branches or removing more
than 20 percent of the foliage in a short time
frame stresses plants too much and dimin¬
ishes harvest. But if taking clones, some
growers effectively prune a mother down to
stubby branches and let her recuperate for a
month or longer.
Pruning too much over time may alter
hormonal concentrations, causing spindly
growth. This is often the case with mother
plants that provide too many clones. The
mother must rest and gain girth, because
small, spindly branches root poorly.

Remove all but the four main branches.
The meristem (central stem) is removed
just above the four lowest (main) branches.
Removing the central leader concentrates
the floral hormones in the four remain¬

ing branches. Fewer branches are stronger
and bear a larger quantity of dense, heavy
flower tops. Remove the stem above the
four main branches; do not remove leaves
on the main branches. Select plants with
three sets of branch nodes about six weeks
old, and pinch or prune out the last set of
nodes so that two sets of branches remain.
Move plants into the flowering room when
they are about 12 inches tall. 'Skunk # 1 ’ and
similarly robust bloomers should be set in
the flowering room when about six to eight
inches tall.
The FIM Technique was coined by an
anonymous High Times reader from South
Carolina in the July 20C0 issue of the
magazine. The technique became legend¬
ary on www.overgrow.com, ever since the
grower wrote: "this pruning technique could
revolutionize indoor gardening." The South
Carolina grower tried to pinch the tip of a
plant and said "Fuck, I Missed!" when he did
not remove the entire bud and coined the
acronym FIM.

VEGETATIVE GROWTH
Bending
Bending is similar to pruning, in that it
alters the flow of hormones. Bending effi¬
ciently neutralizes the effect of the growthinhibiting hormone. Bending is much easier
on plants than pruning. To bend, lean a
branch in the desired direction and tie it
in place. Branches can take a lot of bend¬
ing before they fold over or break. Even if a
branch folds, tie it in place; if necessary, use
a wooden splint. The stem will heal itself.
Young, supple branches take bending much
better than old, stiff ones. Bending branches
horizontally will encourage the buds to grow
vertically towards the light. Each bud will
turn into an impressive top, because they
all receive more light. A wooden planter box
with a lattice trellis alongside makes a great
anchor to tie bent plants to.

Wire ties, the kind used to close bread
sacks, can be purchased at a nursery. Wire
ties are either pre-cut or cut to length by
the grower. Plastic-coated electronic and
telephone cable wire also work well. They
are fastened with a simple twist and stay
rigid, leaving the stem breathing room. But if
applied too tightly around a stem, the liquids
cannot flow, and death could result.
Be gentle when bending, even though
cannabis can take much abuse. Sometimes
a crotch will separate or a branch will fold
over, cutting off fluid flow. These mishaps
are easily fixed with a small wooden splint
snugly secured with wire ties or duct tape to
support the split and broken stem.
Growers also combine bending and prun¬
ing. It is easy to prune too much, but it is
hard to over bend.

Air Pruning Roots
When roots grow to the end of the con¬
tainer and are exposed to air, they stop
growing. The air naturally prunes roots. They
cannot grow out the end of the pot, because
the climate with little moisture and lots of air
is too inhospitable.

Bending branches lowers the garden profile and allows sunshine to reach smaller buds.

VEGETATIVE GROWTH
Chemical Root Pruning
Chemical root pruning is an excellent way
to control root growth inside containers.
Commercial nursery people have been using
chemical root pruning for many years with
outstanding results. This passage is con¬
densed from an excellent FAQ article on
chemical root pruning with great photos by
Uncle Ben, a charter member of the shut
down site www.overgrow.com.
Uncle Ben used a product called Griffin’s
Spin-Out that consists of copper hydroxide
suspended in a carrier. To use, simply spraypaint the inside of the containers with two
coats of Griffin’s Spin-Out. Roots grow to
within a fraction of an inch of the copper
hydroxide, then stop. Roots will not touch
the unpleasant compound. The result is
similar to what happens aboveground when
new, lower growth is stimulated as branch
tips are pruned. When pruned with copper
hydroxide paint, more roots develop overall,
and they grow in the entire root ball, espe¬
cially in the center. Plants with a dense root
system dispersed evenly throughout the root
ball are easier to maintain, and they grow
bigger in smaller containers.

To remove large plants from containers, use a
knife or blade to separate roots from the inside
of the container. Move the blade up and down
all the way around the inside of the container to
break roots away.

The roots in this potbound plant form a mass
around the interior and bottom of the container.
Roots that grow out drainage holes are "pruned"

Grafting

Stress

Little is known about grafting cannabis. Yes,
it is possible to graft cannabis to hops. Most
often the hop stem is grafted to a cannabis
rootstock. The plant will live; however, it will
not produce THC.
I asked a number of growers if they had
experimented with grafting, and none had.
Grafting an indica stem to a large sativa
rootstock would be an interesting experi¬
ment. The larger root system could easily
supply water and nutrients to the smaller
indica plant. The resulting plant would be
drought resistant.

Cannabis grows best and produces heavi¬
est when it is given a stable environment.

Gently remove a portion of the soil from the root
ball. I like to remove the part in the center of the
root ball where few roots reside.

Stressed plants produce less than unstressed
plants. Stress-induced trauma include with¬
holding water, photoperiod fluctuation, low
light intensity, ultraviolet light, nutrient toxicities and deficiencies, cold and hot soil,
ambient temperatures and mutilation. In
addition, any overt applications of growth
hormones such as B9 hormone, gibberellins,
cytokinins, abscisic acid, ethylene, colchicine,
etc., cause stress.

Once 30-40% of the soil has been removed' lay
a base of fresh soil in the bottom of the container
and fit remaining root ball on top of it. Fill the
container with fresh potting soil and gently pack
in place. After transplanting, water heavily with a
Vitamin B1 solution.

Stress can cause plants to produce more
resin, but it simultaneously causes odd and/
or reduced growth. For example, Felix, a
Swiss outdoor grower, grew a field of canna¬
bis at 900 feet (300 meters) and another at
4200 feet (1300 meters). The upper field suf¬
fered stress, because it is exposed to cooler
temperatures and more ultraviolet radiation.
Plants there produce about 25 percent more
resin-packed THC than plants in the lower
field. But, plants that grow at 900 feet (300
meters) yield at least 25 percent or more dry
weight than plants at the 4200-foot eleva¬
tion.

Removing large green shade leaves allows
more light to shine on smaller leaves, but it
also causes growth to slow and harvest to
diminish. Remove only leaves that are more
than half damaged by pests or diseases.
Often, partially yellow leaves green up once
stress is eliminated. Removing spindly, dimly
lit lower branches stresses plants much less
than removing leaves to speed growth of
upper foliage.
Mutilating plants by breaking the trunk,
driving a stake through the trunk, torturing
or slapping them around might increase
resin production, but most often the stress
retards growth and causes other problems.

Insides of pots have been painted with Griffin's Spin-Out containing copper hydroxide
to prune roots.

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The I

This close-up of a root ball shows a spot scraped

Stressed plants with wounded stems and
vegetation grow slower and invite pests and
diseases.

This photo of the foot-long fibrous mass of roots
was taken after Uncle Ben shook off much of the
semi-dry soil.

Withholding water may also cause more
resin production, but it impairs growth and
diminishes leaf, stem, and flower production.
Water stress slows or stops clones from root¬
ing. If clones have too many leaves and are
too busy transpiring, root growth is very slow.
Conversely, waterlogged rooting mediums
harbor no air, and rooting is also
slowed to a crawl.
Stress can also affect plants'
sex. See Chapter Sixteen,
Breeding, for more information.

Introduction
Cannabis must flower and produce seeds
to successfully complete its annual life cycle.
Marijuana is a dioecious plant, being either
male (pollen producing) or female (ovule
producing). However, hermaphrodite (bisex¬
ual) plants with both male and female flow¬
ers can also occur.
In nature, cannabis flowers in the fall, after

the long hot days of summer. The long nights
and short days of autumn signal marijuana
to start flowering. Plants are normally either
male or female. Cannabis produces male
or female pre-flowers after four weeks of
vegetative growth. For more information, see
"Pre-flowering" in this chapter.
Growth patterns and chemistry change dur¬
ing flowering: stems elongate; leaves grow pro¬
gressively fewer blades; cannabinoid produc¬
tion slows at first then accelerates; and flower
formation is rapid at first then slows. Nutrient
needs change as growth stages change. Plants
focus on flower production rather than veg¬
etative growth. Green chlorophyll production,

Asymmetrical branching occurs as plants grown
from seed begin to flower.

requiring much nitrogen, slows. Phosphorus
and potassium uptake increase to promote
floral formation. Shortly before the flowering
stage, growers change to a "super bloom"
fertilizer formula with less nitrogen and more
potassium and phosphorus.
Induce flowering in greenhouses, outdoors,
and indoors by giving plants more hours
of total darkness and fewer hours of light.
Give cannabis 12 hours of uninterrupted
darkness and 12 hours of light to induce vis¬
ible signs of flowering in two weeks or less.
This program is effective in all but the latest
blooming pure sativa strains. Growers with
a vegetative room illuminated 18-24 hours a
day and a flowering room with 12-hour days
and 12-hour nights, create environments that
mimic the photoperiod in summer and fall.
With this simple combination, growers crank
out a crop of outstanding buds every six to
ten weeks all year long.

The top of this bud from an unknown strain is a
mass of white, fuzzy, hair-like pistils.

When a low-nitrogen super bloom fertilizer with
more phosphorus and potassium is used, fan
leaves yellow during flowering.

laden flowers continue to open and shed pollen

Inducing flowering in cannabis grown from
seed with a 12/12 day/night photoperiod
will cause plants to show sex, male or
female. Once the sex of the plant is guar¬
anteed, males are almost always harvested
before they shed pollen, and females are
coaxed into higher yields. Once the photo¬
period is set, disrupting it will cause plants
to suffer stress. If they suffer enough stress,
hermaphrodite tendencies increase.
Water intake of flowering plants is usually
somewhat less than in the vegetative stage.
Adequate water during flowering is impor¬
tant for plants to carry on internal chemistry
and resin production. Withholding water to
"stress" a plant will actually stunt growth and
diminish yield.
Removing large fan leaves to allow more
intense light to reach small buds or to stress
plants is crazy! Large leaves are necessary to
keep plants healthy. Indoors and in green¬
houses where the hours of darkness are con¬
trolled, cannabis flowers for six to ten weeks
or longer. This is a very short time. Hacking
off branch tips to initiate more budding sites
diffuses floral hormones and retards growth.
Remove only leaves that are 50 percent or
more damaged by diseases, pests, and cul¬
tural practices.
Upon pollination, one of the many, tiny
grains of pollen from the male (staminate)
flower pod, lands on a pistil of the female
(pistillate) flower. Female flower tops are a
mass of calyxes with each calyx harboring an
ovule and a protruding set of pistils. Actual
fertilization takes place when the grain of
male pollen slides down the pistil and unites
with the female ovule deep within the
female calyx. Once fertilization takes place,
pistils turn brown and a seed forms within
the seed bract. Seeds are the result of this
sexual propagation and contain genetic char¬
acteristics of both parents. In nature there is
a 50/50 chance for a seed to produce a male
or female plant. Once fertilized with male
pollen, female plants put the bulk of their

FLOWERING
energy into producing strong, viable seeds.
When flowers are full of ripe, mature seeds,
the female will die, having successfully com¬
pleted her life cycle. The male completes
his life cycle and dies after producing and
dispersing all of his pollen into the wind, in
search of receptive female pistils.

Pre-flowering
Pre-flowers, described by Robert Clarke in
Marijuana Botany as "primordial," are the
first indication of a plant's sex. The pre-flow¬
ers grow at branch internodes just behind
the leaf spur or stipule about the fourth week
of vegetative growth, when the plant is six to
eight weeks old. This is the point of sexual
maturity, the first sign a plant is preparing for
flowering-the next stage in life.
You can see pre-flowers with the naked
eye, but a 10 to 30X magnifier will make
viewing easier. You can accurately determine
plant sex after eight weeks. Using this meth¬
od, you can distinguish sex before inducing
flowering.

Male Pre-flowering
Male pre-flowers are normally visible when

plants are six to eight weeks old, after the
fourth week of vegetative growth. The pre¬
flowers emerge behind the stipule at the
fourth to fifth branch internodes and general¬
ly do not turn into full flowers. But, according
to Bongaloid (www.overgrow.com, now shut
down) "a male plant will develop mature
staminate flowers after prolonged periods of
vegetative growth."
Always wait to induce flowering until after
pre-flowers appear. Inducing flowering with
12 hours of uninterrupted darkness and 12
hours of light before pre-flowers develop will
stress the plant. This stress could cause pecu¬
liar growth, and plants might develop into
hermaphrodites. Inducing flowering before

pre-flowers form will not expedite flower¬
ing. In fact, flowering will occur at about
the same time as if you had waited for preflowers to show!
Plants grown from seed under a 24/0
photoperiod will generally show pre¬
flowers after plants that are given a
18/6 day/night photoperiod. Once pre¬
flowers are distinguishable as male or female,
plants can be induced to flower with a 12/12

Male Flowering
When given a 12/12 day/night photope¬
riod, male cannabis reaches maturity and
flowers one to two weeks before females.
However, male plants do not necessarily
need a 12/12 day/night photoperiod to
dawn flowers and shed pollen. Males can
flower under long days and short nights as
well, but they generally produce fewer flow¬
ers. Once male calyxes show, pollen devel¬
ops quickly and can disperse within a very
short time. There is always an early opener
that sheds pollen, often within 24 hours or
less! To avoid pollination problems, remove
males as soon as they are distinguished. If
growing male plants, always isolate them
from females, so they will not be pollinated.
See Chapter 5, "Harvest," for more informa¬
tion on harvesting males.
Males continue flowering and shedding
yellowish, dust-like pollen from bell-shaped
pollen sacks well into the females' flowering
stage, which ensures pollination. If you are
making seeds, pollinating females too early,
before the girls have developed many recep¬
tive female pistils, will result in a small seed
crop. See Chapter Sixteen, "Breeding," for
more information.
Male flowers are about one quarter-inch
(6 mm) long and pastel green to yellow¬
ish in color. Flowers first develop near the
top of the plant. Pollen sacks develop on
a short spike and hang in clusters at the
base of branches. Gradually, flowers develop
towards the bottom of the plant. After two
to six weeks of the 12-hour photoperiod,
fully formed floral sacks split open and shed
pollen.
Males are usually taller than females and
have stout stems, sporadic branching, and
fewer leaves. In nature, wind and gravity
carry pollen from taller males to fertilize (pol¬

linate) receptive females. Male plants pro¬
duce fewer flowers than females, because
one male plant can pollinate many females.
Males also contain less THC and overall
lower cannabinoid levels.
Males fertilize females, causing them to
stop high THC production and start seed for¬
mation. Remove and destroy males, except
those used for breeding, as soon as their sex
has been determined. The instant they show
sex, separate male plants used for breeding
from females. Do not let them shed pollen.
Premature pollen sacks often form and open
early or are hidden under foliage and go
unnoticed until it is too late. If growing from
seed, take special care to ferret out male
flowers and plants.
Growers have reported that bouncing the
photoperiod around and dynamically raising
or lowering the temperature have the effect
of producing more male plants. Note that
each stimulus involves creating a climate that
causes plants to suffer stress. Also, the stress¬
ful environment does not necessarily turn
the entire plant male; it turns it hermaph¬
rodite. The most susceptible plants already

have a predisposition to hermaphrodism.
See Chapter Sixteen, "Breeding," for more
information.
There are several ways to promote male or
female plants during seedling growth. (See
"Grow More Female Plants from Seed" in
Chapter Two.) During vegetative growth you
can get a good idea of a plant's sex from its
genetic background and growth character¬
istics. The most dependable way to deduce
sex is "Cloning for Sex" (see Chapter Three).
For a complete discussion, see Chapter
Sixteen, "Breeding."

Female Pre-flowering

The pre-flower on this 'Mr. Bubble' female is very
easy to spot with the naked eye.

Pre-flowers on this 'Puna Budder' from THSeeds
are nearing the end of the pre-flowering stage
that lasts about two weeks.

Near the end of normal vegetative growth,
plants grown from seed develop pre-flowers.
This is when female calyx formation initiates,
and it is not contingent upon photoperiod. It
occurs when a plant is old enough to show
signs of sexual maturity, about the fourth
week of vegetative growth, or six to eight
weeks from germination. The pre-flowers
emerge behind the stipule at the fourth to
fifth branch internodes.
A pre-flower iooks like a regular female
flower; most have a pair of white fuzzy pis¬
tils. Pistils normally form after the light green
seed bract part of the pre-flower has formed.
Wait until pistils have formed to ensure the
plant is a female and not a male. The pre¬
flowering stage lasts from one to two weeks.
A little patience is in order now!
Plants grown from seed under an 18/6
day/night photoperiod will usually show
pronounced pre-flowers before plants
given a 24/0 day/night photoperiod. And,
under a 16/8 day/night regimen pre-flow¬
ers show more quickly and are often more
pronounced. As soon as you can distinguish
pre-flowers as male or female, plants can be
induced to flower with a 12/12 day/night
photoperiod.

Wait to induce flowering until pre-flowers
have appeared. Inducing flowering with 12
hours of uninterrupted darkness and 12
hours of light before pre-flowers set will
stress the plant. Such stress could cause
strange growth, and plants may grow into
hermaphrodites. Inducing flowering before
pre-flowers develop does not make plants
flower faster. Plants will flower about the
same time as if you had waited for pre-flow¬
ers to develop.

Female Flowering
Female cannabis is prized for heavy, potent
resin production and weighty flower yield.
Ideal female plants grow squat and bushy
with branches close together on the stem
and dense foliage on branches. In most
strains, the first signs of female flowers
appear one to three weeks after inducing
flowering with the 12-hour photoperiod.
Female flowers initially appear near the top
of the terminal bud and gradually develop on
lower branches starting at the tips and mov¬
ing downward. Flowers have two small onequarter to one-half inch (6-12 mm) fuzzy,
white hairs, called pistils that form a "V."
The set of pistils is attached at the base to
an ovule, which is contained in a light green
pod, called a calyx. Pistil-packed calyxes
form dense clusters or buds along stems. A
cluster of buds is often called a top or cola.
The masses of calyxes develop rapidly for the
first four or five weeks, after which they grow
at a slower rate. Buds put on much of their
harvest weight as they swell during the last
two or three weeks of growth. Pure sativas,
including Thai varieties, can flower for four
months or longer! Once the ovule has been
fertilized by male pollen, rapid calyx forma¬
tion and resin production slow, and seed
growth starts.
When females' flowering is at their zenith,
pistils swell and swell. Soon they change in
color, most often from white to amber and,
eventually, to reddish brown.

expense, and the long, patient wait is a bounti¬
ful harvest. Strong, healthy, well-grown clones
and seedlings yield the heaviest harvests. A weilorganized pre-harvest and harvest are essential
to presen/e cannabis quality and decrease the
workload.
Harvest when plants are at peak ripeness.
Depending upon the high you like, which is
discussed below, harvest tinning is critical. The
peak harvest window is open for about five to
seven days.
Once harvested, most growers manicure buds
before drying them slowly and evenly so THC
is preserved. After drying, buds should cure to
achieve full aroma and flavor. Like a fine wine,
aging or curing improves taste and fragrance.
Once cured, proper storage will ensure buds
retain all of their essential qualities.

Fragrance is often a problem before, during,
and after harvest. Control fragrance by keeping
drying and manicuring rooms well-vented. If
possible, allow plenty of fresh circulating air to
pass through the drying room to remove odors
quickly. If air in and around drying and manicur¬
ing room is stagnant, odors linger and accu¬
mulate. Keep temperatures below 70°F (21°C)
so essential oils in cannabis do not volatize
and release pleasant but unwanted fragrances.
Contain cannabis fragrance in sealed drying
and manicuring rooms. Filter air before expel¬
ling with a carbon filter. See "Odor” in Chapter
Thirteen for more information on controlling
fragrance.
Avoid the taste of organic or chemical fertilizers
in harvested buds by flushing with plain water
or a clearing solution to remove any residuals
and chemicals that have built up in soil or plant
foliage. Ten to fourteen days before harvesting,
flush the garden with distilled water or water
treated with reverse osmosis. Use a clearing
solution such as Final Flush® if you have to use
plain tap water that contains dissolved solids.
Some growers fertilize until three to four days
before harvest and use a clearing solution to
remove fertilizer residues. Apply this water just
as you would apply nutrient solution. Always let
at least ten percent, preferably more, drain out
the bottom of containers. If using a recirculating

time by a day or more and not affect the quality
of the end product.

Harvest
Growth stops at harvest and the THC con¬
tent cannot increase. It will stay the same or
decrease after harvest. Proper handling is the
key to retaining THC potency. Prolonged peri¬
ods of light, temperatures above 80°F (27°C),
friction from fondling hands, and damp, humid
conditions should be avoided because they all
degrade the THC.
The THC chemical is produced in leaves,
flowers, and stalked glandular trichomes, lov¬
ingly referred to as "resin glands" or simply
"trichomes." Stems and roots may smell like
they should be smoked, but contain few mindbending cannabinoids, if any, and the resin
is not very psychoactive. Male plants contain
much less THC and are harvested before they
pollinate females. Female plants are harvested
when trichomes show peak ripeness. Leaves are
harvested first.
Growers hang plants upside down because
it is simple, convenient, and effective— not to
drain existing THC-potent resin into the buds.
Also, boiling roots to extract THC is crazy!

Leaves
Once the large leaves are fully formed, THC
potency has generally peaked out. Smaller
leaves around buds continue to develop resin
until buds are ripe. Peak potency is retained, as
long as leaves are healthy and green; nothing
is lost by leaving them on the plant. Harvest
leaves if they show signs of disease or rapid
yellowing that fertilizer has failed to cure. Once

they start to yellow and die, potency decreases
somewhat. This is true especially with fan leaves
that grow before the buds. The large leaves turn
yellow when nitrogen-rich fertilizer is withheld
during flowering.
Cut the entire leaf, including the leaf stem
(petiole) and toss it into a bag. Paper bags
breathe well and can be closed by folding over
the top. Plastic bags do not breathe, so the
top must be left open. If the petiole is left on
the stem, it shrivels and dies back. This little
bit of dead plant attracts moisture and mold.
Removing it will avoid mold problems.
Keep the paper bag in a closet or area with
40-60 percent humidity and 60-70°F (15-21°C)
temperature. Reach into the bag once or twice
a day and stir leaves by hand. Leaves should be
dry to the touch in five to seven days. Once dry,
place in the freezer to get ready to make Ice-OLator hash.

Male Harvest
Male flowers can produce pollen as early as
two weeks after changing lights to the 12-hour
day/night schedule. Watch out for early open¬
ers. Three to six weeks after initiating flowering,
pollen sacks open and continue producing
flowers for several weeks after the first pods
have begun to shed pollen. Once male flowers
are clearly visible but not yet open, THC produc¬
tion is at peak levels. (See "Sinsemilla Harvest"
for information on trichome glands.) This is
the best time to harvest. Once males release
pollen, the degradation process speeds up and
flowers fall.

open male flower, carefully cover the male plant
with a plastic bag, and tie it off at the bottom
before harvesting. Or, if you can see an open
pollen sack, spray it with water to make pollen
unviable. Keep males used for breeding as far
from flowering females as possible. Make sure
to install fine screens for air coming into the
flowering room and wet them down regularly
to discourage rogue pollen. Isolate males until
needed. After a month, the male will start
reverting to vegetative growth even though it
retains viable sacks of pollen. Males can also
be cloned and held in the vegetative stage until
needed. Induce flowering about three weeks
before viable pollen is needed. Within three to
five weeks, the male will be full of viable pollen
sacks.
Prolong male harvest by removing flowers
with tweezers or fingernails as they appear.
New flowers soon emerge after plucking old
ones. Continue to remove pollen sacks until
females are two weeks from full bloom. Picking
off individual male flowers is a tedious, time
consuming process, and it is easy to miss a
few.
Harvesting most of the branches, leaving only
one or two pollen-bearing limbs, is practical. A
single male flower contains enough pollen to
fertilize many female ovules; a single branch full
of male flowers is necessary to produce enough
pollen for most home breeding needs.

ready to be made into hash.

Sinsemilla Harvest
Sinsemilla flowers are mature from 6-12
weeks after the photoperiod has been changed
to 12 hours. The best time to harvest sinsemilla
is when THC production has peaked but not
yet started the degradation process. Established
indoor varieties are bred so the entire plant
reaches peak potency at the same time. Lower
flower tops that received less light are not as
heavily frosted with resin as upper branches
and could be slower to mature. Varieties that
ripen all at once tend to go through four to five
weeks of rapid bud formation before growth
levels off. The harvest is taken one to three
weeks after growth slows. Pure indica varieties
and many indica/sativa crosses are picked six to
ten weeks after inducing flowering, while indica
crosses with more dominant sativas, such as
'Skunk #T, may not be ready for ten weeks.
Commercial growers often pick immature sixweek-old buds so they can harvest one more
crop every year.
Pure sativa varieties, especially Thai and Asian
strains that were grown from native seed, take
longer to bloom after turning the light to 12
hours. They could take four months to finish
blooming! These types tend to form buds at an
even rate throughout flowering with no marked
decline in growth rate. Few indoor growers
have the time or patience to grow pure sativa

it is not the best indicator of peak ripeness.
After more hands-on research, I have learned
that it is difficult to tell peak ripeness by the
color of pistils in all strains. The best gauge of
peak ripeness is the color of the resin glands or
trichomes.
Resin glands change colors as they ripen.
At first, glands are clear. As they continue to
mature, they turn a translucent milky color and,
finally, they turn amber. Resin glands that are
bruised from being squeezed or jostled about
deteriorate quickly. All glands do not change
color simultaneously on the same bud or plant.
The process is gradual, and individual resin
glands change at different rates. Of course there

are exceptions such as the strain ’Blueberry,’
which bears darker, even purplish resin glands.
To get a close-up look at resin glands, use
a 10X magnifying glass, jeweler's loupe, or a
20-50X hand-held microscope. My preference
is. a 30X hand-held microscope with a batterypowered lamp used by stamp collectors. Look
at resin glands without harvesting buds, or take
a small, thin, resinous portion of a ripe bud
and place it under the microscope at a low 30X
magnification setting. If the microscope does
not have a lamp, a flashlight will be necessary
for an un-shadowed view.
Resin gland development will be in one of
three stages—clear, translucent or milky white,
and amber.
Harvest when the majority of glands are
clear and a few glands have started to turn
milky white. Harvesting plants too early, before
a few of the glands turn milky, will make
them less psychoactive, because they hold
less THC. Harvesting at this point will yield a
cerebral, soaring, heady stone. The body will be
less affected. Pure sativa and sativa-dominant
strains are perfect for this harvest scenario.

trichome is a "plant hair." The trichomes found on drug cannabis are glandular and
secretory in character. These stalked glandular trichomes are comprised of a stalk with a
resin head. They look like a post with the knob at the top. They form on buds and small
leaves. The highest concentration of THC is located at the base of the resin head. The
best time to harvest is when these trichomes have developed a spherical head and are
transparent to creamy white. Senescing glands start to turn amber and later brown and
get smaller; they are decomposing, and THC content diminishes. Check buds every day
starting the sixth week of flowering. Check several buds from different plants to ensure
the maximum amount of trichomes are ripe for harvest.
Cystolith trichomes have a pointed tip and are often long and hair-like. These protective
trichomes are most common
on leaf undersides. Cystolith
glands exude insecticidal
and miticidal substances to
gum up pest mouthparts
and repel them, but they
have no THC.

The glandular trichomes in this photo are
short and stout. Crystalman added color

However, drying the entire plant by hanging it

Step Six: To harvest entire plants and/or
branches:
a. Remove large leaves one or two days
before actually cutting the plants down.
Or remove leaves after cutting plants.
Harvesting large leaves early gets them
out of the way and makes manicuring

Harvest when the majority of trichomes have
turned amber for a body stone. Pure indica,
afghani, and /nd/co-dominant strains harvested
at this late point will possess a heavy body, or
couch-lock, stone. Waiting to harvest pure sativa
and sof/Vo-dominant varieties until this stage
will not take advantage of the strains. Such
strains are best harvested when resin glands are
clear to milky colored.

Harvest Step-by-Step
Step One: Stop fertilization seven to ten days
prior to harvest. Latent nutrient accumulation
in foliage imparts a fertilizer-like taste. Leach
nutrients from the growing medium seven to
ten days before harvest. Some growers continue
to fertilize until three days before harvest if using
a product such as Final Flush®. Such products
expedite flushing built-up chemicals from can¬
nabis plants.
Step Two: If sprays have been applied during
the last week (not recommended), mist plants
heavily to wash off undesirable residues that
may have accumulated on foliage. The bath will
not affect resin production. Gently jiggle buds
after rinsing to shake off any standing water. To
prevent fungus and bud blight, wash the garden
early in the day to allow excess water on leaves
to dry before nightfall. If bud mold (botrytis) is a
threat, DO NOT wash buds.

Step Three: You may want to give plants 24
hours of total darkness before harvest. Many
growers do this and say the buds are a little
more resinous afterward.

Step Four: Harvest in the morning when THC
content is at its peak. Harvest entire plant or one
branch at a time by cutting near the base with
pruners. Jerking the root ball creates a mess and
is unnecessary. All of the THC is produced in the
foliage, not in the roots.
84

Manicuring
Once harvested, carefully manicure buds by
cutting large leaves where they attach to the
stem. Leaving the petiole (leaf stem) can cause
mold to grow. Snip off smaller, low-potency
leaves around buds that show little resin, so a
beautiful THC-potent bud remains.
Manicuring is easiest when leaves are soft and
supple immediately after harvest. Trimming off
leaves now will also speed drying. Waiting until
foliage is dry to manicure will make manicuring
buds a tedious, time-consuming job.
Manicuring is easiest with a good pair of trim¬
ming scissors that has small blades to facilitate
reaching in and snipping off leaf petioles at the

Chapter FIVE
main stem. An ergonomic pair of scissors with
comfortable handles is indispensable when
manicuring cannabis for hours.
Manicure over a fine silkscreen (see Chapter
15, "Hash") or a glass table. Scrape up fallen
resin glands on the table or under the screen.
This potent resin can be smoked immediately
or pressed into blocks of hash.
Wear inexpensive rubber gloves to collect
"finger hash." After trimming for a few hours,
remove accumulated finger hash on gloves by
bathing in a small portion of isopropyl alcohol.
Set the hash-laden alcohol on the counter over¬
night to evaporate. Scrape up the remaining
hash after all the alcohol has evaporated. Or put
the rubber gloves in a freezer for a few hours.
Cooling will make it easier to scrape and rub the
accumulated hash from the gloves.
Scrape accumulated resin from scissors when
it impairs blade movement. Use a small knife
to remove built-up resin from blades. Ball up
small bits of scraped resin by rubbing it together
between fingers. The ball of hash will grow as
manicuring progresses.
Budget enough time to harvest and manicure
your crop. Properly manicuring one pound (454
gm) takes from four to six hours by hand with
scissors and one to two hours when using an
automatic trimmer.

tral form. In other words, fresh green marijuana
will not be very potent. Drying also converts 75
percent or more of the freshly harvested plant
into water vapor and other gases.
When you cut a plant or plant part and hang
it to dry, the transport of fluids within the plant
continues, but at a slower rate. Stomata close
soon after harvest, and drying is slowed since
little water vapor escapes. The natural plant pro¬
cesses slowly come to an end as the plant dries.
The outer cells are the first to dry, but fluid still
moves from internal cells to supply moisture
to outer cells which are dry. When this process
occurs properly, plants dry evenly throughout.
Removing leaves and large stems upon harvest
speeds drying; however, moisture content with¬
in the "dried” buds, leaves, and stems is uneven.
If buds are dried too quickly, chlorophyll and
other pigments, starch, and nitrates are trapped
within plant tissue, making it taste "green," burn
unevenly, and taste bad.
When dried relatively slowly, over five to
seven days or longer, moisture evaporates
evenly into the air, yielding uniformly dry buds
with minimal THC decomposition. Slowly dried
buds taste sweet and smoke smooth. Taste
and aroma improve when pigments break

down. Slow even drying-where moisture con¬
tent is the same throughout stems, foliage and
buds- allows enough time for the pigments to
degrade. Hanging entire plants to dry allows this
process to take place over time.
To speed drying time, remove large leaves and
stems upon harvest. Fresh supple leaves are
easier to work with than when dry. When you
are looking at manicuring 10 pounds (4.5 kg),
you make it as easy as possible!
Plants with outer "fan" leaves intact take
longer to dry and require much more time to
manicure. The outer leaves form a sheath that
helps protect delicate trichomes when drying,
but this practice turns trimming dry leaves into
a tedious, messy, two-step job.
Circulation and ventilation fans will help con¬
trol heat and humidity and keep them at proper
levels. You can also use a dehumidifier to con¬
trol humidity. An air conditioner is ideal to "dial
in" temperature and humidity in warm climates.
Large drying areas may require a heater to raise
temperature and lower humidity. Do not train
fans directly on drying plants; it causes them to
dry unevenly.
For best results, drying should be slow. Ideal
air temperature is between 65 and 75°F (1824°C) and humidity from 45 to 55 percent.
Temperatures below 65°F (18°C) slow drying,
and humidity often climbs quickly. Humidity
above 80 percent extends drying time and
makes the threat of bud mold imminent.
Temperatures above 75°F (24°C) may cause
buds to dry too fast, and humidity can also fall
below the ideal 50 percent level more easily.
Temperatures above 85°F (29°C) cause buds to
dry so fast that smoke becomes harsh. Relative
humidity below 30-40 percent causes buds to
dry too fast and retain chlorophyll, giving them a
"green" taste. Fast-dried buds become crispy and
crumble. Low humidity also causes buds to lose
flavor and odor. If humidity is between 30 and
40 percent, allow for minimum air movement
to slow drying. Always use an accurate maxi¬
mum/minimum thermometer and hygrometer
to ensure temperature and humidity are kept in
the ideal range.

Small harvests can easily be dried in a closet,
cabinet, or a cardboard box that is a fraction of
the growing area's size. Large harvests require
much more room. If drying space is a problem, a
staggered planting schedule, or planting varieties
that ripen both early and late, carries over to a
staggered harvest that frees up drying space as
buds dry.
Large outdoor and indoor crops need large
spaces in which to dry. You can use the grow
area as a drying room if not growing any plants.
Do not dry plants in the same room in which
plants grow. Different climates are required for
growing marijuana and drying it. Fungus and
spider mites can also migrate from dead plants
to live ones. Inspect drying buds daily for any
signs of fungus, mold, and spider mites. Smear

form a barrier which keeps mites from migrating

in the enclosed area is diminished, and buds
and leaves must be turned daily to even out the
moisture content and discourage mold. Thread a
large needle with dental floss, and string the floss
back and forth through the box near the top to
make drying lines. If the box is tall enough, you

Use a portable foldable clothesline to make a
quick mobile drying room. Unfold clothesline,
hang buds from lines, and cover with a large,
black bed sheet or cloth. The cloth sheet allows
the exchange of air and maintains darkness. Train

underneath and dries buds.
Building a small drying room is as easy as
tacking some plywood together at right angles
and hanging lines across the enclosure. Or you
can make walls from black Visqueen™ plastic
by tacking or taping it to the ceiling and floor to

Drying a large harvest can require a large space.
If you have a large space such as a bedroom,
barn, shed, etc., cut plants at the base and
remove large leaves, and hang on drying lines in
the room. Cut branches from 12-40 inches (30100 cm). Manicure each branch and hang on
drying lines to complete the drying process.
Save space by building or buying drying racks
for the buds. Make drying racks from window
screen or plastic agricultural netting. Stretch the
screen or netting over a wooden frame and
secure with staples. Put three- to six-inch (8-15cm) spacers between framed screens to allow
adequate airflow. Or build a drying box with
removable screens. See photo above.
Hang manicured buds to dry for a day or
two before placing on drying screens to allow
the bulk of the moisture to dissipate. Once on
screens, buds should be turned daily to ensure
even drying.

A simple drying box is easy to make. Wooden
spacers between boxes allow for adequate air flow.
Manicured buds can also be placed in boxes
to dry. Move buds daily so new surfaces are
exposed to air. Buds dry slower, because the air
flow is reduced. Line boxes with plastic or alu¬
minum foil to contain for collection resin glands
that fall to the bottom. To contain resin glands,
seal cracks in boxes with tape.
Drying time depends upon temperature,
humidity, and bud density. Most buds will be
dry enough to cure in five to seven days. Big, fat,
dense buds can take three to four days longer.
Gently squeeze buds after they dry for a few
days to check for moisture content. Bend stems
to see if they are done. If the stem breaks rather
than folds, it is ready to cure.
Check for dryness by bending a stem. The
stem should snap rather than fold when bent.
The bud should be dry to touch, but not brittle.
The bud should burn well enough to smoke
when dry.

Curing allows buds to continue to dry slowly.
The first week of curing affects potency in that
it evenly removes moisture within the bud so
virtually all the THC is psychoactive. Curing also
allows buds to dry enough that mold does not
grow when buds are stored. Weil-cured buds
have an even glow when burned and smoke
smooth.
After plants, branches, and/or buds have dried
on screens or hung in a drying room for five
to seven days and appear to be dry, they still
contain moisture inside. This moisture affects
taste and potency. Curing will remove this excess
moisture. Curing makes the bud uniformly dry
and converts virtually all THC into its psychoac¬
tive form.
Cut stems into manageable lengths-less than
12-18 inches (30-45 cm)-and place them in
an airtight container. Airtight glass containers
with a rubber or similar seal are the best. Avoid
Ziploc and other plastic bags that are riot air¬
tight. Plastic bags used for long-term storage
are airtight. The "reflection anti-detection barrier
foil bags" available from Hy Supply (www.hy
supply.nP) are airtight and infrared-proof.
Some growers avoid plastic containers such as
Rubbermaid™ bins and Tupperware™, saying the
plastic imparts an undesirable flavor to the buds.
But when curing large amounts, such plastic bins
are the best option because stuffing 10 pounds
(4.5 kg) or more into small canning jars would
be laborious and impractical.

Enclose buds in a container to create a micro¬
climate that allows moisture to even out within
the buds. Internal moisture will migrate to the
dry portions of the bud. Gently pack as many
buds into container as possible without forc¬
ing and damaging them. Leave the containers
in a cool, dry, dark place. Check in two to four
hours to see if buds have "sweated" moisture.
Check buds by gently squeezing to feel if they
are moister than they were a few hours before.
Be careful when squeezing buds; resin glands
bruise easily.
If stems fold instead of snapping when bent,
and buds are still moist to the touch, remove
them from the container and gently place in
the bottom of a paper bag. They can be stacked
in the paper bag as high as six inches (15 cm).
Fold the top of the bag once or twice to close.
Check the buds two to three times during the
day to monitor drying. Carefully turn them in
the bag so that different sides are exposed.

Fast Drying
Here are six ways to dry buds quickly. Remember, buds
that dry quickly burn hot; the smoke is harsh, and they taste
"green" when smoked.
One: Manicure fresh buds and remove all branches. Spread
them out evenly and wrap in paper or enclose in an enve¬
lope. Place the paper or envelope on a warm refrigerator,
radiator, television, etc. Depending upon heat level, buds will
be dry in a few hours to overnight. Buds will be a bit crispy
when dry. Place buds in an airtight container until they sweat.
Put back in the paper and dry until dehydrated enough to
burn well.
Two: Cut up fresh buds and/or foliage. Place on a 12-inch
(30 cm) square of tinfoil. Hold or place it over a 60-100-watt
light bulb. Stir every 15-30 seconds. It will be dry enough to
smoke in one to three minutes.
Three: Place diced buds and/or foliage on a cookie sheet in
an oven at 150°F (65°C) for 10-15 minutes. Check regularly
and stir if needed until dry. Do not increase temperature
above 200°F (93°C) or the THC will vaporize into the air.
Four: Place cut up buds and/or foliage in a microwave
oven. Turn the microwave on in short, weak (50 percent
power) bursts of 15-30 seconds each. Recycle until dry, and
stir if necessary.
Five: Cut buds and/or foliage into small pieces, and place
in a glass jar with an airtight lid. Place several silica gel desic¬
cant packs (the kind that come with electronic devices and
cameras) into the glass jar and seal. Moisture will migrate
to the silica gel in a few hours. Remove the packets and dry
using dry heat source. Replace silica packs until marijuana is
dry enough to smoke. Find silica
gel packs at auto parts or elec¬
tronics stores.
Six: Drying buds in a food dehy¬
drator for 24-48 hours is the next
best option. Food dehydrators
are a series of stackable screens.
Place bud and leaf on screens
and stack. A fan blows air gen¬
tly upward to dry the marijuana
quickly. One friend used this tech¬
nique and the buds smoked OK,
but it was the only dope around,
and this could have colored my
taste perceptions!

92

Freeze Drying
Dry ice is frozen carbon
dioxide. When it warms,
C02 converts from a fro¬
zen solid to a gas, without
turning into a liquid. When
moist marijuana is enclosed
with dry ice (frozen C02) at
virtually zero relative humid¬
ity, water molecules migrate
from the cannabis to the
dry ice. This causes the rela¬
tive humidity of the C02 to
increase and the moisture
content of the marijuana
to decrease. This process
occurs below 32°F (0°C),
and it preserves cannabis.
Place equal amounts of
dry ice and bud into a con¬
tainer. Put the dry ice on
the bottom and bud on top.
Seal with a lid. Make a few
small holes in the lid of the
container for excess gas to
exit. Place in your kitchen
freezer. Check every 12-24
hours. When the dry ice is
gone, the buds should be
completely dry. If not dry,
add more dry ice until can¬
nabis is dry. Conserve dry ice
by partially drying buds for a
few days before enclosing
with dry ice.

and curing process to learn how much moisture
it has iost. For example, a bud that weighs 10
grams (0.36 oz) upon harvest, will weigh 2.5
grams (0.09 oz) when it has lost 75 percent of
its moisture, in general, a dry bud will weigh 75
percent less than its wet weight at harvest.

Packaging and Storage
Storing cannabis in an airtight environment
will preserve aroma, taste, and potency. Use
a vacuum sealer to evacuate air in glass jars.
Inexpensive vacuum sealers are available in the
canning section of grocery and variety stores.
Growers report that containers sealed with inex¬
pensive vacuum sealers lose the vacuum after a
few days. More expensive vacuum sealers such
as the one available at www.deni.com work
much better. When properly vacuum-packed,
buds will stay as fresh as the day they were
sealed in the airtight jar.
Vacuum seal the jar, and place it in the refrig¬
erator for storage. Leave it in the refrigerator or
a cool, dark, dry place for a month or longer.
The taste and potency will be tops! Refrigeration
slows decomposition, but, remember, refrigera¬
tors have a high humidity level, so the container
must be sealed airtight. I just checked the rela¬
tive humidity and temperature in my refrigera¬
tor-65 percent relative humidity and 40°F (5°C).
Do not place it in the freezer. Freezing draws
moisture to the surface of buds, which can harm
resin glands on the surface.
Piace sealed containers in a cool, dry, dark
place. Some growers prefer to keep airtight,
sealed containers in the refrigerator. If the seal
is not airtight, the low temperature in the refrig¬
erator creates a condition of high humidity. Dry
buds stored in a container that is not airtight
attract moisture in the high-humidity environ¬
ment. Before long, the buds are so moist that
they must be dried again.

This grower lets buds dry slowly in a large cedar
box before moving them to a glass container for
the final cure.

Remove the lid of a jar two or three times a day
to allow moisture to escape during the curing
process.

Seed Crops

and ripe. Often, seeds actually split open their

hour photoperiod. If second crops
are allowed to grow too tall, they
produce sparse buds. Remember,
these plants are already root bound
and when given dim light, sparse
buds result.
Here is a possible scenario to
rejuvenate plants. For example, a
person who grew a beautiful crop
of females and knew each plant
by name, had to harvest. Instead
of starting from seed again, the
grower decided to leave a few
leaves and buds on the harvested
stubby branches. He induced veg¬
etative growth with 18-hour days
and 6-hour nights the day after
harvesting. A month later, he took
many clones from these original
favorite females. He induced the
original mothers to flower a month
after the clones were taken. The
clones were rooted, transplanted,
and moved into a flowering room.
The original harvest was taken on
January 1st. The second harvest
was April 1st. The second harvest
weighed less, and the buds were
smaller. Taking clones from rejuve¬

Introduction
The best location for a grow room is in an
obscure corner of a basement, where the
temperature is easy to keep constant year
round. Basements are well insulated by con¬
crete walls and soil. A basement room can
be enclosed and camouflaged with junk, a
double wall, workbench, or shelving.
Added security is afforded by installing
a false door in a closet. The grow room is
located behind the secret door. Another
good secret location, except for the pos¬
sible heat build-up, is the attic. Few people
venture to an attic that is difficult to access.
Some growers locate their gardens below a
trapdoor covered with a rug.
Law enforcement cannot use the electricity
bill as sole grounds for a search warrant. But,
they can use it along with other "evidence"

The grow room's size determines the size
and the number of lamps. High intensity
discharge (HID) lamps that work well to
grow marijuana are available in wattages of
150, 175, 250, 400, 600, 1000, and 1100.
Smaller wattages from 150-400, work well
in closets or spaces with 9-21 square feet
(0.8-2 m2) of floor space. Use 600-watt and
larger bulbs for larger areas.
The drawings (pages 108-109) show sev¬
eral grow room floor plans. As the floor
plans demonstrate, there are several basic
approaches to grow room design and pro¬
duction. Most growers start out with a crop
grown in a single room. After they harvest
the crop, they introduce a new batch of

vegetative room, and a clone chamber.

clones. The photoperiod is switched back to
18 hours, and the cycle continues.
The most productive setups utilize two
rooms. The first room is for vegetative
growth, mother plants, and rooting clones.
This room should be about one-quarter
the size of the flowering room. When the
flowering room crop is harvested, plants
from the vegetative room are moved into
the flowering room.
Super productivity is achieved with a per¬
petual crop. Several clones are taken every
day or every week. Every day a few plants
are harvested. For every plant harvested, a
new cutting takes its place.

This productive grow room is located in a closedoff corner of the basement.

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER':

Setting Up the Grow RoomStep-by-Step
Set up the grow room before introduc¬
ing plants. Construction requires space and
planning. A grow room under construction
offers a terrible environment for plants. Once
the grow room is set up and totally opera¬
tional, it will be ready for plants.
Take a little time to set up your grow room so all
the space is used efficiently.

Step One: Choose an out-of-the-way space with
little or no traffic. A corner of the basement or
a spare bedroom are perfect. A 1000-watt HID,
properly set up, will efficiently illuminate up to a
6 x 6-foot (1.8 x 1.8 m) room. The ceiling should
be at least five feet (1.5 m) high. Keep in mind
that plants in containers are set up at least one
foot (30 cm) off the ground, and the lamp needs
about a foot (30 cm) of space to hang from the
ceiling. This leaves only three feet (90 cm) of
space for plants to grow. If forced to grow in an
attic or basement with a low four-foot (120 cm)
ceiling, much can be done to compensate for the
loss of height, including cloning, bending, pruning,
and using smaller wattage lamps.

Step Two: Enclose the room, if not already
This closet grow room has everything necessary
to grow a crop-lights, fans, and cannabis! A
400-watt HID lights the 3x4- foot (90 x 120 cm)
flowering room above, and two 55-watt CFLs in
one reflector illuminate mothers and clones in

enclosed. Remove everything that does not
pertain to the garden. Furniture, drapes,
and curtains may harbor fungi. An enclosed
room allows easy, precise control of every¬
thing and everyone that enters or exits, as
well as who and what goes on inside. For
most growers, enclosing the grow room is
simply a matter of tacking up some plywood

JpRrf.

A single 1000-watt metal halide can grow
enough mothers, clones, and vegetative plants to
support 4000 watts of flowering HID light. This
design allows pungent odors to waft upward
before being evacuated via roof fans. A third
area in the attic is used as a heat buffer in hot
climates.

This attic grow room has access via a retractable
ladder. The grower uses the dead airspace above
the room for his ozone generator to exchange air

or fabricating plastic walls in the basement
or attic and painting the room flat white.
Make sure no light is visible from outside.
If covering a window, do so discreetly-it
should not look boarded up. Insulate win¬
dows and walls so a telltale heat signature
does not escape. Basement windows often
are painted to look like the foundation.
Place some stuff-books, personal effects,
household goods, etc.-in front of the win¬
dow, and build a box around the things so
a natural scene is visible from the outside.
At night, bright light leaking through a crack
in an uncovered window is like a beacon to
curious neighbors or bandits.
Step Three: Cover walls, ceiling, flooreve ryth in g-with a highly reflective mate¬
rial like flat white paint or Mylar. The more
reflection, the more light energy available to
plants. Good reflective light will allow effec¬
tive coverage of an HID lamp to increase
from 10 to 20 percent, just by putting a few
dollars worth of paint on the walls. Reflective
white Visqueen® plastic is inexpensive and
protects walls and floors.
Step Four: See "Setting Up the Vent Fan"
in Chapter Thirteen. Constant air circula¬
tion and a supply of fresh air are essential
but often inadequate. There should be at
least one fresh-air vent in every grow room.
Vents can be an open door, window, or duct
vented to the outside. An exhaust fan vented
outdoors or pulling new air through an open
door usually creates an adequate flow of air.
An oscillating fan works well to circulate air.
When installing such a fan, make sure it is
not set in a fixed position and blowing too
hard on tender plants. It could cause windburn and dry out plants, especially seedlings
and clones. If the room contains a heat vent,
it may be opened to supply extra heat or air
circulation.
Step Five: The larger your garden becomes,
the more water it will need. A 10 x 10-foot
(3 x 3 m) garden could use more than 50
gallons (190 L) per week. Carrying water is

This attic grow room is insulated with Styrofoam
and reflection/anti-detection barrier foil available
at www.hysupply.nl, which keeps the heat
signature from showing.

In this simple Sea of Green layout, there are ten
plants in each tray (80 total plants) illuminated
by a single 1000-watt HID. Each week one tray
of ten plants is harvested, and ten new plants
are started.

These plants are growing in 3-gallon (11 L)
pots and spaced on 6-inch (15 cm) centers. The
5-foot (2 m) high walls are covered with white
Visqueen plastic.

Keeping heat inside the room is as important as
keeping it out! Insulation will keep heat out, and
the heat generated inside the room will be easy
to control.

hard, regular work. One gallon (3.8 L) of
water weighs eight pounds (3.6 kg); 50 x 8
= 400 pounds (180 kg) of water a week! It is
much easier to run in a hose with an on/off
valve or install a hose bib in the room than
to schlep water. A three-foot (90 cm) water¬
ing wand attached to the hose on/off valve
makes watering easier and saves branches
from being broken when watering in dense
foliage. Hook up the hose to a hot and cold
water source so the temperature is easy to
regulate.
Step Six: Ideally, the floor should be
concrete or a smooth surface that can be
swept and washed down. A floor drain is
very handy. In grow rooms with carpet or
wood floors, a large, white painter's drop
cloth or thick, white Visqueen plastic, will
protect floors from moisture. Trays placed
beneath each container add protection and
convenience.
Step Seven: Mount a hook strong enough
to support 30 pounds (14 kg) for each lamp.
Attach an adjustable chain or cord and pul¬
ley between the ceiling hook and the lamp
fixture. The adjustable connection makes it
easy to keep the lamp at the proper distance
from plants and up out of the way during
maintenance.
Step Eight: There are some tools an indoor
gardener must have and a few extra tools
that make indoor horticulture much more
precise and cost effective. The extra tools help
make the garden so efficient that they pay for
themselves in a few weeks. Procure all the
tools before bringing plants into the room.
If the tools are there when needed, chances
are they will be put to use. A hygrometer is a
good example. If plants show signs of slow,
sickly growth due to high humidity, most
growers will not identify the exact cause
right away. They will wait and guess, wait
and guess, and maybe figure it out before
a fungus attacks and the plant dies. When
a hygrometer is installed before plants are
brought into the grow room, the horticulturist

SIX

GROW ROOMS & GREENHOUSES

will know from the start when the humidity is
too high and causing sickly growth.
Step Nine: Read and complete: "Setting Up
the HID Lamp" at the end of Chapter Nine.
Step Ten: Move seedlings and rooted
clones into the room. Huddle them closely
together under the lamp. Make sure the HID
is not so close to small plants that it burns
their leaves. Position 400-watt lamps 18
inches (45 cm) above seedlings and clones.
Place a 600-watt lamp 24 inches (60 cm)
away and a 1000-watt lamp 30 inches (75
cm) away. Check the distance daily. Hang
a precut string from the hood to measure
distance.

This drawing shows how to install a vent fan.
Adding rubber feet or padding around the fan
will dampen noise.

Greenhouses and Cold
Frames
This simple overview of greenhouses and
cold frames will give you a feeling of what
to look for and how to plan your project and
reap a heavy harvest. Several links below will
help you tap into the wealth of information
on greenhouses and cold frames.
Greenhouses, cold frames, and hot frames
are all useful in extending the growing
season and/or protecting new plants and
seedlings. Which type of structure you select
depends on the size and iocation of your
growing area, how much money you have
to spend, how much time you have to grow,
and security issues. Simple cold frames and
hot frames can be assembled from common
materials like old framed window panes and
hay bales. Greenhouses are generally larger
and more complex. They can be expensive to
build and maintain but offer more flexibility
for growing time and building use.
When deciding on a growing structure,
first carefully analyze the project on paper.
Consider how much space you have for the
footprint and how many plants you can grow
safely. Cold frames are small and can be as
simple as a glass or plastic frame set on the
ground with no artificial heat source. Their

A vent fan and an oscillating circulation fan are

basic function is to protect young plants
and seedlings from wind and cold in the
early spring, but they can also be blacked
out to induce early flowering and harvest.
Hot frames are similar in size and structure
but provide heat through manure, electricity,
steam, or a hot-water pipe (radiant heat).
You may use a hot frame to raise early seed¬
lings and clones, after which the structure
can be converted into a cold frame. Both
frames share the advantages of economy,
simplicity, small size, and portability.
Both large and small greenhouses cost
more money, time, and space. With the
exception of the lightweight "hoop" house
or miniature greenhouse, they are also more
permanent. The type of greenhouse selected
will be determined by the planned use of the
space and where it will be located. A leanto or attached greenhouse will probably be
smaller and less expensive to build than a
freestanding structure.
Total area of the greenhouse is determined
by the number of plants you intend to
grow. Allow one square yard (90 cm2) per
mature plant. Do not forget to allow about

six inches (15 cm) space for air circulation
between benches and side-walls. Add space
for walkways-standing room only or room
for a wheelbarrow-and possibly a center
bench. Glass, plastic panels, and sheeting all
come in standard widths, and it is easier to
build in a size compatible with these units
rather than have to cut the panels down. For
example, an eight-foot (2.4 m) house can be
made with two 48-inch (120 cm) wide fiber¬
glass panels. Center height depends on the
level of the eaves. Low growing plants can
take an eave of five feet (1.5 m); tall plants
need six or seven feet (1.8 or 2.1 m). After
determining eave height, a simple formula
wiil give you the center height: Center height
= eave + 0.25 width (a twelve-foot wide (3.6
m) house with a five-foot (1.5 m) eave will
have a center height of eight feet (2.4 m).

or benches, two walks, and a wide center
bed or bench. An 8 to 12 foot (2.4 to 3.6 m)
wide lean-to with wide beds or benches and
a central walk is the least expensive option
overall. Whichever option you choose, build¬
ing it yourself will be cheaper and more
secure than hiring a contractor. You can
purchase much of the plumbing and elec¬
tricity installations in kits or pre-assembled
to avoid compromising security. Here is an

Climate will play a role in choosing your
greenhouse. For example, a cold frame in
the mild Pacific Northwest can give you a
six-week jump on the growing season. This
would not work in a colder region like the
upper Midwest. Likewise, a hot or tropical
area will require more shade and water.
While the large cold frame is the most eco-

an efficient vent.

This small greenhouse is covered with corrugated

nomical of structures, it will not function as a
cold-climate garden. Location and exposure
will depend on climate, but in general, you
will want the greenhouse to be sheltered
from curious eyes and strong winds and to
be away from any areas where falling limbs
or other debris might be a problem.
Hoop houses are very easy to construct from
plastic or metal pipe. Some growers use rebar.
Arches can easily be made with PVC plastic
pipe up to 8 feet (2.4 m) tall. You can also
make tunnels hug the ground with a height of
less than 3 feet (90 cm).

There are a number of external design
options. Cold frames can be as simple as a
window sash laid over a rectangle of straw
bales or a piece of plastic stretched over a
metal or PVC pipe frame and held in place
with clamps. Duct tape also works wonders
to keep plastic in place. The advantage to
plastic sheeting is that it can be removed
during the day to take advantage of fresh
air and the sun’s warmth and then replaced
at night to protect plants from cold air. The
cold frame can easily be converted to a hot
frame by installing electric heat and a water¬
ing/misting system.
Greenhouses can be attached (lean-to,

A lean-to uses an existing structure for one or
more sides and is limited to single or double¬
row plant benches with a total width of
seven to twelve feet (2.1-3.6 m) and length
up to that of the building. Without consider¬
ing security, the advantages of the lean-to are
its proximity to electricity, water, and heat,
but on the downside are its limited size, light,
ventilation, and temperature control.
A window-mount replaces an existing win¬
dow providing a relatively low-cost way to
grow short plants, small seedlings, or clones.
It can be installed fairly simply with common
household tools. The disadvantages are its
small size and possibly public view.

Small greenhouses and cold frames also
work well on patios, balconies, and rooftops.
They protect plants from wind and prying
eyes of neighbors.
An even-span can be an attractive option.
Like the window-mount or lean-to, the evenspan is attached to the house and bears
similar limitations of size, light, ventilation,
and temperature. Unlike the lean-to or win¬
dow-mount, the even-span can be larger
and can open into the house-providing heat
and humidity-or even function as a conser¬
vatory, an attractive place to relax. It is, how¬
ever, more expensive to heat and maintain.

materials. There are also a number of good
web sites such as

the plan that works best for you.
Framing can be in wood or metal. You may
select a panel frame which is more expen¬
sive to build (panels are individual units) but
has the advantage of quick installation and
breakdown for storage. If portability is an
issue, there are miniature greenhouses and
hoop houses which can be purchased as a
kit for under $300. These structures, because
they can be picked up and moved, are usu¬
ally considered temporary by municipalities
and often do not require permits. For more

Plastic is much cheaper than glass (a
sixth to a tenth of the cost), can be heat¬
ed as effectively as glass, and is equal to
glass in producing quality plants and buds.
Polyethylene (PE) is low cost, lightweight,
provides ample light, and can withstand fall,
winter, and spring weather. It does not toler¬
ate summer UV levels, however, and must
be replaced annually. Ultra-violet inhibited
PE lasts longer, but both types lose heat
more quickly than glass. During the day, this
can help keep plants cooler, but at night the
heat loss requires the use of an artificial heat
source. Poly Weave™ is a plastic fabric made
of 8-mil polyethylene reinforced with nylon
mesh. It transmits up to 90% sunlight, can
be sewn or taped, and has a lifespan of up
to five years.
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is two to five times
more expensive than PE but can last five
years or longer. Polyvinylchloride is pliable,
transparent or translucent, and comes in
four to six foot (1.2-1.8 m) widths which can
be sealed together to provide a super-wide
piece. Ultraviolet inhibited corrugated plastic
panels provide another option. The panels
can be used in cold frames, propagation
houses, and greenhouses to provide excel¬
lent wind and snow protection and optimal
solar heat collection. UV inhibited corrugated
plastic also has insulating properties (2.5 R
insulation/3.5 mm panels, 3.0 R/5.0 mm
panels).
Corrugated fiberglass is lightweight, strong,
and comes in eight to twelve foot (2.4-3.6
m) panels. Poor grades will discolor, reduc¬
ing light penetration, but a good grade of
clear fiberglass can cost as much or more
than glass. Its lower weight is an advantage,
and it is more difficult to see through!
Lexan™
http://www.geplastics.com/
gelexan/ is a thermoplastic that lasts for
years and transmits almost as much light as
glass while retaining heat. Clear panels like
those in glass or Lexan™ may require shading
during the heat of the day. Again, there are a

number of options. You may select a roll-up
shade of wood or aluminum, or a shading
compound that is painted onto the outside
of the glass. Vinyl plastic is a flexible film that
installs easily against wet glass inside the
structure and is reusable.
Framework and covering are only the
beginning. Growing plants in a greenhouse
is often more demanding than growing
plants indoors. Air temperature, humidity,
light, and air quality must all be controlled in
relation to a constantly changing greenhouse
climate.

Climate Control
Even the best greenhouses will lose heat
through radiation, conduction, convection
through glass, walls, and floor (or soil), and
also through vents, doors, and cracks. To
counteract external variables, the internal
structure of the greenhouse is, in some ways,
more complex than the selection of framing
and covering materials.
All greenhouses need ventilation and most
need fans. Look for an extraction fan with
the capacity to change the air once every
minute. Capacity refers to the amount of
power needed to circulate the air volume of
your structure.
Calculate the volume by multiplying the
square footage of your greenhouse by the
height. Multiply the volume by sixty air
changes per hour to get the cubic feet per
minute (cfm) capacity of the greenhouse.
For example a greenhouse with the fol¬
lowing:
8 x 12x7 feet (2.4 x 3.6 x 2.1 m) green¬
house requires a fan with a cfm of 40,320
8 x 12x7 feet x 60 minutes = 40,320
Here is a similar metric example:
2.5 x 3.5 x 2 = 17.5 m2 x 60 minutes =
1050 m3
The combination of louvers and fan will
force the hottest, most humid air out while
protecting the plants from draft. See Chapter
Thirteen, "Air," for more information.

Big strong buds are a few weeks from harvest.
Vents control temperatures in all seasons
and improve growing conditions. Hand-oper¬
ated roof vents will require frequent checks,
or you may install automatic vents with
an electric motor and thermostat that will
respond to conditions around the clock.
Venting is important with a cold frame, too.
The high-end models have wax-filled vents
that operate automatically, opening when the

heat rises in the frame and contracting as the
temperature cools. You can find the paraffinfilled "Optivent" and many other greenhouse
supplies at www.charleysgreenhouse.com.
Heating systems are important to keep
plants healthy during cold nights. Cannabis
grows well with night temperatures of 6065°F (16-18°C), but colder nights will require
an additional heat source for sustained
growth.
You can turn a cold frame into a hot frame
by insulating it with manure or heating it with
steam, hot water pipes, or electricity. To make
the most efficient use of electricity, purchase
soil-heating tape or cable, with a thermostat
that will automatically control the tempera¬
ture. Lay the cable on the soil at the bottom
of the bed or on a bed of sand or vermiculite
and cover with about two inches (5 cm) of
sand. You will need to provide 10-15 watts of
electric heat for every square foot (30 cm2) of
growing area. Heat cables are also useful in
greenhouses for warming seedlings, clones,
or flowering plants without the cost of heat¬
ing the entire structure.
Small greenhouses can be heated relatively
economically with an electric space heater,
or more effectively with thermostatically con¬
trolled forced air using ducts or plastic tubing
to distribute the heat. Larger units may be

heated with forced air or by a coal or natural
hot-water or steam system. Steam can also
be used to sterilize growing beds and potting
soils. Then there is the low-tech method of
greenhouse warming: compost. A grower in
Portland, Oregon, stacks organic matter on
the sides of the greenhouse to a height of
about five feet (1.5 m) inside and out. As the
compost decomposes, it gives off heat keep¬
ing the structure warm at a very low cost.
Evaporative cooling eliminates excess heat
and adds humidity, reducing water needs.
Moist air circulates through the structure
while warm air is expelled through roof vents
or exhaust fans. Properly installed, a cooler
can reduce the interior temperature as much
as 30-40°F (15-23°C) in hot, dry climates,
less in wetter areas. As with fans, the size
of the cooler is determined by the size of
the greenhouse. A general guideline is to
find a cooler equal to the total cubic space
of the structure plus 50%. To provide both
cooling and humidifying effects, the cooler
must be installed on the outside of the
greenhouse; otherwise, it simply humidifies
without dropping the temperature. Turner
greenhouses has a handy site (http://www.
turnergreenhouses.com/Cooling/cool_tip.
htmi) with some quick tips on selecting a
cooling system for your greenhouse. Other
great greenhouse sites include:
http://www.igcusa.com/greenhousecooling information.htm for some helpful
graphics and http://www.cpjungle.com/
nuecool.htm for a detailed explanation of
cooling needs and resources.
Misting and watering are also important
components of greenhouse gardening.
Extended periods of growing and higher sus¬
tained temperatures make adequate water
essential. Again, there are methods to suit
every temperament from low-tech to auto¬
matic.
Most companies offer watering and misting
systems by component, which can be mixed
and matched to suit the grower's needs.

GROW ROOMS & GREENHOUSES
& ‘ J

Automatic systems will have a timer that trig¬
gers the mist or water at preset intervals. You
may want a toggle switch that allows you to
rotate between manual and automatic water¬
ing. For more information on specific uses and
types of watering systems, go to a website
such as www.cloudtops.com which covers
a variety of topics pertaining to the internal
greenhouse environment.
A lower-tech method of mist and watering
control consists of a series of screens that
tilt downward with the weight of the water
shutting off the flow then raising to restart the
cycle as the screens dry. It is fully automated
by the weight of the water or lack thereof.
Of course, there is also hand-watering which
is very effective and requires no mechanical
intervention. Automatic systems, both high
and low-tech, are alternatives to hand-water¬
ing that can be most helpful during a garden¬
er's absence.
Heating and watering devices depend on
that other cost of greenhouse keeping: how
much time the grower has to spend tending
plants. You can keep equipment costs to a
minimum if you plan to spend a lot of time
in the greenhouse. For growers who are away
from the structure for long periods, automatic
systems are a good investment.
In addition to shelter, heat, water, and venti¬
lation, plants need light. This section will offer
a brief treatment of lighting, since it is covered
in greater depth in Chapter Nine. Fluorescent
light offers higher efficiency with low heat and
is the most widely used. Incandescent light60-500 watts-may be used to extend daylength. High-intensity discharge (HID) offers
long life, and the sodium lamps emit the best
light to be combined with natural sunlight.
Regardless of light source selected, you may
want to purchase a light meter ($30-50). It will
be very useful in setting the light level in your
greenhouse for maximum efficiency.
Carbon Dioxide (C02) is another important
aspect of the greenhouse environment that
will be only touched upon in this section.

Closed greenhouses often have too little C02
during the day for plants to be able to use
light effectively. Enhancing the levels of C02
will accelerate plant growth; methods for
doing so range from expensive C02 equip¬
ment with infrared sensors to block dry ice

Security is always a concern when growing
cannabis. There are several ways to camou¬
flage the greenhouse such as growing other
plants with the cannabis. Paint the walls
with sun-blocking paint so light still enters
but prying eyes do not. Go to the discount
store and purchase artificial flowers. Put the
artificial flowers on and around the cannabis
plants so it looks like they are growing from
the cannabis. Remember to pay attention to
other plants that could be blooming during
this time and follow suit.
Planting in the earth floor of the green¬
house allows you to use organic methods.
The plants cannot be moved easily, but they
grow bigger and require less maintenance
than container-grown plants. Without con¬
tainers, plants also retain a lower profile.
Growing in Mother Earth is always better
than planting in pots! Most all the principles
that apply to outdoor growing apply to grow¬
ing in a greenhouse, too. Check out Chapter
Seven, "Outdoors" and Chapter Ten, "Soil &
Containers" for more information.

GROW ROOMS & GREENHOUSES
Greenhouses can be darkened
to induce flowering during mid
summer. This practice will allow
you to harvest up to three crops a
year! Cannabis plants flower when
nights are long (12 hours) and days
are short (12 hours). Darken the
greenhouse so that plants receive
12 hours of uninterrupted dark¬
ness every day to induce flowering.
When the greenhouse is darkened
daily so that plants receive 12 hours
of darkness, a crop of clones plant¬
ed May 1 st can be harvested by the
middle of July.
Automatic darkening machinery
is available for large commercial
greenhouses. Smaller greenhouses
are normally covered with black
plastic to "black out" the interior
for 12 hours.

used during non-daylight hours.
Greenhouse growers turn the HID lights on
when sunlight diminishes (30 minutes before
sunset) and off when sunlight strengthens (30
minutes after sunrise). Turn on the HID when
the daylight intensity is less than two times
the intensity of the HID. Measure this point
with a light meter. Turn off the HID when the
daylight intensity is greater than two times
the intensity of the HID. A simple photocell
that measures light intensity can be used to
turn the lights on and off automatically.
Supplementary lighting has greatest effect
when applied to the youngest plants. It is
least expensive to light plants when they are
small.
Many different types of coverings are avail¬
able for greenhouses and cold frames. The
best greenhouse films are UV (ultraviolet)
resistant and still transmit plenty of light.
Lexan is rigid and full of thermo-storing

channels. It is one of the best greenhouse
plastics available. Lexan lasts for years and
transmits almost as much light as glass while
retaining greenhouse heat. The only problem
with Lexan is that it is clear! Some grow¬
ers disguise greenhouse cannabis by wiring
ornamental plastic flowers to the branches
visible to passers by, which is advisable where
neighbors are not curious and laws lax.
Regulating heat in a greenhouse is much
more difficult than in an enclosed grow room.
Greenhouses heat up quickly on sunny days
and cool equally fast when the sun ducks
behind a cloud or drops below the horizon.
This fluctuation in heat is difficult and expen¬
sive to control. Hot and cold dips also affect
the ratio of nutrient to water plants need and
use, which makes growing in a greenhouse
more demanding than growing indoors.
Adding a complete greenhouse chapter

Much of the information that pertains spe¬
cifically to outdoor cultivation is in this chapter.
Many of the subjects within this chapter are
covered in great detail in other chapters of the
book. References to these chapters are made in
the appropriate places.
Outdoor growing is more popular than indoor
growing in countries with lax cannabis laws.
The reason is simple-sunshine is free; lights
and electricity cost money. More people grow
outdoors than indoors for this simple reason.
Cannabis is a strong plant that can be grown
successfully almost anywhere. As long as you
pay attention to security, virtually any growing
area can be altered enough, often with little
effort, to grow a healthy crop.
Do your research before planting. Read garden
columns and talk to local growers about the
best time to plant and grow tomatoes or similar
vegetables, then plan accordingly. Also inquire
about common pests and insects. Collect pub¬
lications on local growing conditions. These are
often available at nurseries or through your local
department or ministry of agriculture.
You can grow anywhere. For example, one
of the first guerilla crops I planted was on a
freeway on-ramp in a city in the Northwest U.S.
in the 1970s. I planted seedlings in a clay soil
in a blackberry infested environment in late
June. I gave the plants a single application of
time release fertilizer. By late September there
were short little female plants with dense little
buds to smoke. The harvest weighed in at just
under a pound of fragrant but leafy little buds.
Everybody called it "homegrown."
My first big guerilla crop was planted and har¬
vested in the California foothills. I hiked up one
of the many canyons carrying a 3.5 hp engine
that weighed 30 pounds, (14 kg) plus the pump
(another 30 pounds) and the plumbing connec¬
tions that made it attach to a 2-inch (5 cm) inlet
and a 1.5-inch (3.5 cm) outlet. Schlepping four,
30-gallon (115 L) plastic garbage cans to act as
reservoirs, 10-foot (3 m) lengths of PVC pipe,

Chapter SEVEN
and 200 feet (60 m) of hose was a challenge!
I made these trips carrying conspicuous sup¬
plies at four in the morning. The hard part was
carrying it all back down when I closed down
the grow show!
After many trips up the canyon, I harvested six
pounds of Colombian and Mexican bud. The
quality was fair, but I harvested early and had
the only fresh buds in town in mid-September.
In "the good old days," rural real estate for
sale in northern California often advertised the
number of marijuana growing holes that had
already been amended.
Now Park Rangers carry guns and have the
authority to arrest "suspected" growers. Latin
mafias have also moved into the National
Forests installing illegal immigrants with guns to
grow and defend large patches of guerilla grass.
The War on Drugs has turned much of America
into an unsafe place to live and grow.
Australia, Canada, much of Europe, and many
other parts of the world are significantly dif¬
ferent; growers can plant in their backyards,
greenhouses, or in remote locations with little
fear of arrest.

Cannabis strains mature at different times.
Choose strains that grow well in your climate and
that ripen before days grow cold and wet.

Strains
Selecting the right strains for your climate is
just as important as finding the perfect location.
This section on strains is adapted from a thread
started by Leaf, a member of vwvw. overgrow,
com and an expert outdoor grower with tons
of experience. One of the Case Studies is
also adapted from posts by Leaf. Much more
information is also available on the site.
This is a quick rundown on some popular out¬
door strains. The strains are grouped in five dif¬
ferent categories distinguished by their finishing
times. For more information on strains, check
our website, www.marijuanagrowing.com.
It is a good idea to grow several different
strains with different finishing times to spread
out the work and drying over the course of time.
If you grow a spring crop, you can harvest much
of the season.

'Hash Plant', available from many seed
companies, is ready to harvest in late August
when grown outdoors.

1. ’Hash Plant’, ’Afghani’, ’Hindu Kush’, etc., are
great varieties that finish mid- to late-August.
The yield and potency are quite high, but
the fragrance is high, too! These strains are
for experienced growers. They need lots of
intense sunlight and must be watered from
below, not from above with rain. These variet¬
ies start to bud when the days are long and
the sunlight is intense. The buds fatten up
quickly on plants with a short, squat growth
habit. Rain followed by hot sunny days can
foster mold, which could decimate the crop in
a short time. Leaf has seen dried, cured buds
the size of softballs that were packed with
mold. They were thrown away. To avoid mold
problems, he suggests harvesting when about
10 percent of the pistils have died back. Even
heavy dew can cause a moldy disaster! Leaf
loves 'Hash Plant'.
2. ’Early Pearl’, 'Early Queen’, ’Early Riser’, etc.,
'Manitoba Poison’, and similar strains fin¬
ish from late-August to early-September at
latitude 49° north. They are potent and yield
a little better than the plants listed above.
They grow from six to nine feet (1.8-2.7 m)
tall and are quite bushy. Most of these strains
are mold resistant and easy to grow-excellent
choices for novices or growers with little time
to look after their plants.
3. ’Mighty Mite', ’Durban Poison’, ’Jack Herer’,
etc., finish mid- to late-September. The yield
and potency are very good, and the odor is
not too intense. All the plants grow a huge,
dominant main cola with several large termi¬
nal buds on main branches. They may need
trellising to avoid broken branches. Topping
appears to increase yield. These strains are
fairly low-maintenance, but the more love
you give, the more they return. These plants
grow well if left alone until mid-September
and have a good harvest as long as they do
not dry out or fall over. 'Mighty Mite’ is another
favorite.
4. ’Blueberry’, ’White Widow’, ’White Rhino',
'Super Silver Haze', 'Pure Power Plant', etc.,
tend to finish mid- to late-October. Yields and

potency are very high! They do not smell a lot
while growing, but that changes when they
are cut! They grow seven- to ten-feet (2-3 m)
tall and yield heavily. They require some atten¬
tion to get the best crop. 'Super Silver Haze'
and 'Pure Power Plant' can be a bitch to grow
because they often develop mold near harvest
when the weather is damp. However, a mild
to moderate frost tends to bring out some
nice (purple) colors. They all do well outdoors
but grow even better indoors.
5. 'Skunk #T, 'Northern Lights #5', 'Big Bud',
and pure or nearly pure sativas finish from
late-October to early-November. Sometimes
sativas do not finish if the weather cools
too much and snow comes. One year, on
November 15th, the first snowfall had to be
shaken off at harvest! About 50 percent of the
pistils had died back. 'Skunk #T is extremely
smelly; the wind can literally carry the skunk
scent for a mile. All of the plants in this group
have a large to huge yield capable of pro¬
ducing several pounds each. 'Big Bud' yields
an enormous amount; the bottom branches
must be tied or staked to avoid breaking from
bud weight. Potency is superb in all plants in
this category except for 'Big Bud.'
All plants grow tall. 'Big Bud' and 'Skunk #1'
grow 10-14 feet (3-4 m) tall. 'Northern Lights'
are often taller! A few sativas can grow to 20

bringing a chilling rain and low light levels. The
more northern zones experience shorter days
and wet cold weather earlier than the southern
zones. Growing outdoors here is challenging
because the temperature seldom drops below

Start Clones or Seedlings Indoors
Get a jump on the season by starting clones
and seedlings under lights indoors. Move small
containerized plants into heated greenhouses
to start hardening-off. Transplant to a backyard
or secure guerilla patch once they have
become hardened-off and are more resistant to
environmental stress.
Beat the cold; start seedlings and cuttings
indoors and move them into a heated green¬
house in March or April. A 400-watt HP sodium
lamp on a timer can augment the less-intense
natural light of early spring. Seedlings and
clones will need at least 14 hours of artificial
and natural light per day until plants are trans¬
planted outdoors.
Alpine mountain climates are cold much of
the year. Freezing temperatures, mineral-heavy
acidic soil, and wind top the list of grower
concerns.
Summer temperatures in the mountains can
dip to 30°F (-1°C) or lower in the summer,
at as low as 2000 feet (610 m) elevation.
Temperatures below 50°F (10°C) virtually stop
growth, and temperatures below 40°F (5°C) can
cause foliage tissue damage in many strains.
Low temperatures cause stress in plants and a
reduction in harvest weight. On the other hand,
plants in high alpine climates tend to produce
more resin and 10-20 percent more THC than
those in lower gardens.
Most alpine soils lack humus, and strong
winds will dry out the plants. For best results,
look for patches where pasture grass grows.
You can help your plants deal with mountain
stress by backfilling planting holes with a mix of
peat moss, soil, polymer crystals, and slow-act¬
ing layers of organic fertilizer.
Cold wind causes moisture loss, and plants
dry out quickly. This causes stress which can
weaken plants and leave them open to attack
by disease and insects.

Guerilla-grown buds suffer many days of wind,
rain, hot sun, and cool nights. Such stressful
conditions often impair resin production.

Polymer crystals mixed in the soil absorb water
and release it over time.

Cool mountain environments, like those
in Switzerland or the Rocky Mountains of
North America, usually experience first frost in
September and last frost during May.
Spring and fall months are rainy with a dry
period in July and August. Cold rains in the fall
can cause mold. Planting early-maturing strains
helps avoid weather problems.

Rain and wind coupled with heavy buds broke this plant. Tied
together with nylon rope, buds were supplied with enough fluids
to produce a healthy harvest.

Tropical climates are generally warm to hot and humid.
Rainy and dry seasons vary by location. Most jungle and
tropical climates have daily rains. Protecting flowering females
from rain with a greenhouse will help avoid bud mold and
other problems. The closer to the equator, the less deviation
there is between the length of days and nights. Extra hours
of artificial light are necessary to keep plants in the vegeta¬
tive growth stage. Tropical sativa strains are often favored in
these regions because they are acclimated and require little
special care.
Nighttime temperatures and humidity are often high. In
fact, extended nighttime temperatures above 85°F (28°C)
will cause plants to stop growing. Nighttime cooling could be
necessary to keep plants growing well.

Soil
Soil is of three main types and all shades of gray and brown
in between. Soil is the product of millions of years of geology.
Clay soil, also known as "heavy soil" or "adobe" in North
America, is common in coastal areas and is very widespread
inland. It is difficult to work with.
Clay soils hold water well and provide slow, even drainage.
Clay soils are slow to warm in the spring, but hold warmth
well into autumn when sunlight is fading. The density of clay
does not allow for proper air circulation, and root growth is
inhibited. For more information on clay soil, see Chapter Ten,
"Soil & Containers."
Prepare clay soil at least a month before planting, adding lots
of compost and manure. Clay soils can hold water too well,
which can smother roots. Adding organic matter will "lighten"
122

the heavy soil, thus creating air
pockets, improving drainage, and
promoting root growth.
The month delay gives the manure
a chance to "cool" so it won't burn
the plants.
Use low sodium manure that con¬
tains few salts. Cows are given
sodium nitrate to make them gain
weight, but that same salt in their
manure can lock up nutrients avail¬
able to the plants, stunting their
growth.
Do not be fooled by anyone who
suggests adding sand to break
up clay soil. Sand and clay create
cement; add straw to make bricks!
One gardener had a backhoe
operator excavate a pit 10 feet
square by 2 feet (3 m x 60 cm)
deep, built a 2-foot (60 cm) retain¬
ing wall around it, then filled it
in with 400 cubic yards of river
loam. This expensive, laborious soil
transformation paid off in one out¬
standing crop after another over
the years.
A long-term option is to annually
till in compost, manure, and other
organic amendments.
Raised beds are an excellent
option for clay soil. Till the clay
when it is damp and workable, and
add manure/compost in heaps;
plant directly in the mounds.
Pile subsoil in a ring around the
plant, making a bowl to catch rain
water.
Sandy soil is found near large
bodies of water, in deserts, and in
many inland areas. It is comprised
of small, medium, and large par¬
ticles and is easy to till even when
wet. Plants can achieve excellent
root penetration. Sandy soil feels
and looks gritty.

Chapter SEVEN
Sand is easy to work and warms
quickly in the spring, but it does
not hold fertilizer well, especially
when over-watered-the nutrients
wash out. Compost helps bind the
large particles providing food and
air circulation, but in hot climates
the organic matter decomposes
rapidly and is soon consumed by
bacteria and other soil organisms.
For best results keep sandy soil
cool, retain moisture with mulch,
and cultivate often, adding addi¬
tional compost. Winter season
cover crops will hold moisture and
prevent runoff while retaining life
in the soil.
Loam soil has all the advantages
of clay and sand; it holds moisture
and water like clay but is quick to
warm and has good drainage and
a work-friendly structure like sand.
It is the perfect growing medium.
Most soils are a combination of
sand and clay. Silty loam falls in
between and feels almost greasy
when rubbed in your hand, though
it is less slippery than clay. The
ultimate soil for growing plants is
loam found in ancient river bot¬
toms and lake beds where sedi¬
mentary soil builds up. It is dark,
fertile, and crumbly in the hand.
Forest soils vary greatly in pH and
fertility. The needles and deadfall
from the trees usually make the
soil acidic.
Most of the forests remaining in
North America and Europe are on
hillsides. Flat land is used for farm¬
ing, recreation, and urban sprawl.
Long-needle pines grow in poor
soils such as those found in moun¬
tainous and tropical regions. They

of humus evolves, short-needle conifers dominate. The roots
on these trees spread out on the surface to search for nour¬
ishment and bury roots to anchor it in place.
Jungles are usually low-growing, hot, moist, and dense.
The soil is shallow and alive. The hot weather makes all
foliage that falls to the ground decompose quickly. Often
nutrients are available to plants, but the soil does not have
a chance to build density. Layers of tropical soils can be very
thin. However, through much of Mexico and Central America
volcanic eruptions brought much rock and minerals to the
surface. Mountain valleys and lowlands are full of alluvial
plains that are packed with nutrient-rich soil.
Grasslands often have wonderful soil that recycles nutri¬
ents. Sunshine is likely to be good, but detection could be
a problem in wide-open spaces. Plant in areas that are pro¬
tected from wind and curious eyes.
Mountain soils are often very rich in minerals but lack
humus. Alpine valleys hold the best alluvial-plain soil that is
the product of volcanic rock erosion. Hillsides are generally
less fertile, and soil must be amended to grow a good crop.
Bog soils are moist and spongy. Bogs are filled with
vegetation and often have very rich soil. They present
a perfect place to grow individual plants. Cut a square
yard (90 cm2) of moist sod from the ground, turn it
over, and plant. Marsh ground supplies sufficient water
on its own. Add a bit of time-release fertilizer during
transplanting and another handful of "flowering" formula
during a check-up in early August.

strong root system and a plant that has a better
chance of surviving in tough conditions. Adding
water-absorbing polymers in the plant mix is an
excellent defense against desiccation, too. The
crystals expand up to 15 times when watered,
making moisture available to the roots for
longer periods of time. Slow-release crystals will
allow an extended period between watering.
This is very helpful if your patch is in a remote
location that you cannot visit often.
Mountain areas can have poor soil and will
need to be improved before planting for best
results. Dig holes at least 18 inches (46 cm)
wide by 18 inches (46 cm) deep for each plant.
Place a handful of blood meal (see warnings
in Chapter Eleven) on the bottom and three
to four inches (8-10 cm) of soil on top of it
before transplanting the cuttings or seedlings,
then water heavily. A little effort preparing the
planting holes will result in healthier plants and
a heavier harvest.
On an incline, planting holes must be terraced
into the hillside and be large enough to catch
runoff water. Dig extra gullies to channel runoff
to growing plants, and make a "dish" around the
plants to hold water.
Plants remain smaller in rocky terrain but often
go unseen because they are grown where no
one expects to see them.
Clay forms an excellent underground planting
container. After a good rain, dig large planting
holes. Fill holes with lots of good dirt and com¬
post. Backfill in layers; for example, fill a threefoot (90 cm) deep hole with an eight-inch (20
cm) layer of steamed bone-meal (see warnings
in Chapter Eleven) and soil. The balance is made
up of a thin layer of topsoil mixed with a rich
compost-manure-straw mixture, rock phosphate,
and seaweed meal. Mound compost and soil

during growing season. See "Organic Fertilizers"

Raised beds
Raised beds are wonderful for growing in
the backyard. Cultivation and weed control are
easier, and soil quality is simpler to maintain.
Build a raised bed on top of clay soils. Planting
in a bed raised six to eight inches (15-20 cm)
eliminates the necessity of trying to dig in clay
while providing the early warmth and good
drainage clay lacks. Plants can be put into the
ground two weeks to a month early and may
even produce an early spring crop.
One friend plants on top of the compost pile.
He plants six, 12-inch-tall (30 cm) clones into

that the roots are safe from burning. He places
a portable greenhouse over the plants. The
compost keeps plants warm while the structure
protects foliage. This works exceptionally well to
coax a spring harvest.
Another grower prepares a vegetable garden
by dumping three cubic yards (90 cm3) of
finished compost and manure with a dose of
dolomite lime into a raised bed, then he rototills and plants. When the vegetables are grow¬
ing well, he transplants hardened-off clones to
blend in alongside vegetables.
Dig big, deep planting holes and backfill
with amended soil.

Place a board at the bottom of fast-draining soils
to hold water longer.

Make raised beds up to 3-feet (90 cm) tall. Layers

Mulch
Mulch attracts and retains soil moisture
and smothers weeds. Mulch is a layer of
decomposing foliage, straw, grass clippings,
weeds, etc. and/or paper, rocks, plastic, etc., laid
around plants.
Native foliage is an excellent and convenient
mulch. My favorite mulch is dry grass clippings,
which are free. Fill your backpack with light¬
weight grass clippings before every trip to the
patch. Always pile the mulch as high as you can
(6-12+ inches (15-30+ cm), because it biode¬
grades over time.
Biodegradable plastic breaks down into frayed
strips that flap in the wind after continued expo¬
sure to sunlight. Plan to use it one year only and
remove it before it shreds into unsightly pieces
of long plastic.
Rock or rock dust makes excellent mulch. Use
rock mulches where they are readily available.
They become hot to touch on sunny days, but
they still protect the soil from evaporative mois¬
ture loss.
Newspaper or brown paper shopping bags
make excellent mulch. Slightly wet paper is eas¬
ier to work with and less likely to blow around.
Inexpensive and readily available, newspaper
layers should be at least six pages thick (prefer¬
ably a dozen or more), before adding a soil or
mulch covering to hold it in place.
Woven weed barriers or strips of scrap carpet

through. Cover these barriers with rock or bark
chips.

Build organic soils using different natural

Water
Planting in a thick layer of mulch is a good way to
conserve moisture.

Cover the entire garden bed with black plastic
and cut holes through which seedlings are
planted. A soaker hose can be laid underneath
the plastic to irrigate. Make sure to cut large
enough holes so that plant stems do not touch
the plastic. Black plastic gets very hot during the
day but actually warms the soil very little. When
a young, tender plant stem touches the hot,
black plastic, it will literally cook at the soil line.

Fertilizers
Plants can be fertilized enough to make them
respond and grow well within a temperature
range

of

60-90°F

(15-32°C),

reasonable

humidity, adequate sunshine, and moderate
wind.
Be sparing with fertilizer the first month after
transplanting. Depending upon the fertilizer,
application could be as often as every watering
or as seldom as every week or two.
If fertilizing with every watering, you may need
to dilute the food to half-strength or less until
you figure out the proper dosage.

Clean rainwater is the best for irrigation. To
make sure it is not too acidic (acid rain) and
harmful to plants, take the pH and parts per
million (ppm) reading from collected rainwater
before using.
Sodium-heavy water builds up in the soil
causing slow growth and shorter plants with
smaller leaves. At low levels, sodium appears
to benefit plants and may even make up for
potassium deficiency, but too much leads to
"sodium stress." Roots lose the ability to absorb
water and other nutrients and will dry out even
with heavy watering. It is very important to test
your water for sodium and other dissolved
solids and take appropriate action if the reading
reaches more than 50 ppm. Sodium is more
of a problem when growing in containers than
when growing in well-drained soil.
See Chapter Eleven for more information on
sodium and water quality.
Local farmers or the Department of Agriculture
have information about water solids in your
area, and many areas have low-cost, state-certi¬
fied labs that can test your water for you.
Often, if the sodium content is below 300
ppm, a good flushing every month will keep
sodium and other salts from building up to
toxic levels.

Water small plants by hand until they are
established.

There are several easy, inexpensive options to
improve water quality.
Irrigate seedlings, clones, and mother plants
with rainwater (or 50 percent rainwater with tap
water) to dilute dissolved solids.
Flush container gardens with three quarts
(3 L) of water for each dry quart (liter) of soil.
Water once with tap water and always after¬
wards with tap water augmented with ammo¬
nium sulfate.
Clean tap water by filling barrels and set¬
ting 2-3 feet (60-90 cm) off the ground. Add
ammonium sulfate to settle out the sodium,
then siphon water from the top of the barrel,
refilling after each watering to allow the chlorine
to evaporate. Chlorine, like sodium, is beneficial
in small amounts. It is essential to the use of
oxygen during photosynthesis and is necessary
for root and leaf cell division. But too much
chlorine causes leaf tips and margins to burn
and leaves to turn a bronze color.
Empty the barrel periodically, and scrub out
residues and sediments. Clean rainwater is an
excellent choice for irrigation. Collect runoff by

Temperature
The best way to control temperature outdoors
is to plant in the right place. Normally hot
temperatures are common during midday in
full sun. Cannabis virtually stops growing at
85°F (29°C). If you are planting in a hot climate,
make sure plants receive filtered sunlight during
the heat of the day. Also, plant them in natural
breezeways so a breeze will cool them during
the heat of the day.
You can create shade over your patch by
bending tree branches and tying them in place.
Cold temperatures can be avoided by planting
at the proper times-well after last frost. Harvest
before first frost!
See Chapter Thirteen, "Air," for more specific
information about temperature.
A shade house covered with "shade cloth"

132

Wind
Wind is one of the strongest forces outdoors.
Sustained wind will suck moisture from plants.
Wind causes plants to draw moisture from
the roots and shed it through the leaves in
a defensive mechanism to regulate internal
temperature and chemistry. It creates a problem
if the water supply is limited.
For example, Southern Spain and other arid
regions are subject to strong desert winds that
transport abrasive sand and other particles.
We call it "kalmia" in Spain because the grit is
mixed with saline air from the Mediterranean.
These winds can destroy crops. If your climate is
plagued by such abrasive winds, protect plants
with windbreaks. Wash foliage with plenty of
water to remove the particles after windstorms.
Moderate sustained winds will dry out con¬
tainer- and field-grown crops within a few
hours. Container crops suffer the most. For
example, plants grown in five-gallon (20 L)
containers on a terrace that receives full sun
and constant moderate winds uses about two
gallons (7.5 L) of water daily! Indoors, the same
plant would use 75 percent less water!
Plant in protected areas so the garden suffers
little effect from strong wind.

weekly (if possible) for pest and fungal damage. Inspect the top and
bottom of leaves for stippling (small spots) from mites or damage from
chewing insects and slugs and snails. First identify the pest, and then
determine a course of action.
Properly grown outdoor cannabis has few problems with pests. See
Chapter Ten, "Soil & Containers," for more information on a wide array
of diseases and pests that attack cannabis.

Low-tech,
natural
approaches to pest control
work well. A few large pests
like caterpillars and snails
can be hand-picked from
the foliage. Caterpillar pop¬
ulations can be reduced at
the source by installing bat
houses. Resident bats will
eat moths and decrease
the number of chewing
caterpillars. Birds will eat
caterpillars too, as well as
aphids and other insects.
Attract birds with suet, bird
houses, baths, and feeders
but cover tender seedlings
and clones with wire or
nylon mesh to protect from
birds, too! Ladybugs and
Praying Mantis are good
options for insect control
and can be purchased from
nursery supply stores.
Barns owls eat mice,
gophers, and voles but are
hard to come by in the city.
If you are lucky enough
to have them nearby, take
advantage of their ability
to eat plant pests. On the
other hand, some rodents,
like moles and shrews,
help your garden by din¬
ing on slugs, insects, and
larvae.
Marigold cultivars of
the Tagetes erecta and T.
patula species, will repel
nematodes, also known as
eelworms, from the soil for
two to three years if they
are planted in an infested
area and then tilled under.
Just planting them in an
area doesn't accomplish
133

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER'S BIBLE
anything. Numerous tests indicate that they
do not have an effect on insects above the
ground.

Frogs and Toads
Frogs and toads eat insects
and slugs. The frogs will need
a water source, while toads
are more terrestrial. Large
snakes in the garden will eat gophers, squirrels,
and mice as well as the moles and shrews.
Snakes can give you a good scare if you come
across one unexpectedly! The snake will also
want to eat your frog. Plan carefully before
committing to any mini-predator solution to
pest infestation.

Birds
Although most birds are
welcome guests in most gardens,
there are some that can make
quick work of tender seedlings
or new clones.
The most effective way to keep
birds from freshly planted seed and transplants
is to cover plants with plastic wire or plastic
netting. When installing the netting, make sure
it is securely fastened around the perimeter of
plants so hungry birds do not get underneath.

Deer and Elk
Deer and elk love newly
formed growth on cannabis
plants. In addition, they may
destroy crops by trampling
them. Elk are somewhat of
a problem, and deer are a
problem!
A cage around plants is the best deterrent. But
remember, the wire may be easy to spot if it is
not discreet in color. Deer are repelled by the
smell of blood and human hair. Place handfuls
of dried blood meal in cloth sacks and dip in
water to activate the smell. Hang sacks from
a tree to discourage dogs and other predators
from eating them.
134

Handfuls of human hair can be placed in
small cloth sacks and hung from a fence or
tree branch as a deterrent. Do not use your
own hair; it could turn into evidence for police!
Scented soaps have repelled deer from some
gardens. But if deer are very hungry, the smell
of blood meal, human hair, scented soap, or
anything else will not deter them.
Always urinate in several locations around the
perimeter of the garden so animals take your
presence seriously. Some growers save urine
all week and disperse it at regular visits to their
patch.
Deer easily bound over eight-foot (2.4 m)
fences. A good deer fence is eight feet (2.4 m)
tall with the top foot (30 cm) sloping outward,
away from the garden at a 45 degree angle.
Electric fences and large dogs are also excellent
deterrents.

Gophers
Pocket gophers
The Biackhole
are small burrowing
rodents thateatplant
roots and foliage.
These
herbivores
find fleshy roots
a real treat and
occasionally attack
cannabis. Should a family of gophers move
into your area, get rid Copher
of them as soon as
possible! Females can
bear up to five litters of four to eight offspring a
year. A family of gophers can clean out a large
garden in a matter of weeks.
Gopher Trap

• Wo Poisons and No Oasts
• Sate and Non-toxic
• Easy to Sat

The only sure way to get rid of gophers is by
trapping. There are several gopher traps avail¬
able, including ones that capture them alive. It
will take some skill before you are regularly able
to catch gophers with traps. You must avoid
getting human scent on any part of the traps. If
gophers sense the human odor, they will simply
push soil over the trap to spring it or render it
otherwise ineffective. Traps are put in gopher
runways and so don't need to be baited.

Chapter SEVEN
A fence of poultry wire or 0.5-inch (1.5 cm)
hardware cloth buried one foot (30 cm) deep
and standing 3 feet (90 cm) above the ground
will exclude gophers. Line planting holes with
chicken wire before filling with soil. Driving
metal sheets around the perimeter of planting
holes will also prevent gopher damage.

Mice and Voles
Mice and voles can chew
bark from around the base of
cannabis plants (girdling). If
this is a problem, keep mulch
a foot away from plants, and
install a wire mesh around
the trunks. Mice and voles make nests in large
piles of mulch, and they are attracted to stored
water. Cover all water sources to exclude them,
but keep in mind that they might chew through
the container if water is super scarce.
The best mouse deterrent is a cat that is
serious about hunting. Mousetraps also work
well on smaller populations. Removing a large
number of mice with traps can be tedious and
unpleasant.
DO NOT USE POISON! Scavenger animals will
eat the dead rodents and may become poi¬
soned themselves.

Moles
Moles are minor pests. They
are primarily insectivores that
eat cutworms and other soil
grubs, but their tunnels may dislodge cannabis
roots.
Repel moles with castor plants or gopher
(mole) plants (Euphorbia lathyris). Castor bean
leaves and castor oil, as well as applications of
tobacco and red pepper, will repel moles if put
into their main runs.
Blend two tablespoons (3 cl) of castor oil with
three tablespoons of dish soap concentrate
and ten tablespoons (18 cl) of water. Mix in a
blender. Use this as a concentrate at the rate
of two tablespoons per gallon (4 ml per liter)
of water. Apply as a soil drench directly over
mole holes.

OUTDOORS
Barrel traps, scissor traps, and guillotine traps
are effective and kill moles instantly.

Rabbits
Rabbits eat almost anything
green, and they multiply like
rabbits! Repel rabbits with a
light dusting of rock phosphate
on young leaves or dried blood
sprinkled around the base of
plants. Manure tea sprayed on leaves and soil
may keep them from dining on your plants.
Rabbits find plants dusted with hot pepper
or a spray of dilute fish emulsion and bone
meal repulsive. There also are a number of
commercial rabbit repellents, but be wary of
using these on consumables!
A dog will help keep rabbits in check, but the
only surefire way to keep rabbits out of the
garden is to fence them out with one-inch (3
cm) poultry wire. The poultry wire should be
buried at least six inches (15 cm) in the ground
to prevent burrowing and rise two or three feet
(60-90 cm) aboveground. Wrap trunks with a
wire mesh or aluminum foil to keep rabbits
from chewing bark in winter or early spring.

Rogue Pollen
Rogue pollen from commercial hemp farms
and wild or cultivated males can threaten
sinsemilla cannabis grown outdoors or in
greenhouses. Undesired pollen can drift from
a few feet to hundreds of miles to pollinate
flowering females and cause them to grow
seeds.
Large clouds of pollen blow across the
Mediterranean Sea from the Riff Mountains in
Morocco dropping pollen on Spain and Portugal.
In fact, local weather reports always include
the cannabis pollen statistics. The reports are
directed at people with allergies but are also
used by marijuana growers.
Make inquiries into air quality including can¬
nabis pollen. Some growers develop "allergies"
in order to get the most information from
officials. Researching wind direction relative to

Backyard Growing
Lucky growers who live in countries that
tolerate cannabis can safely plant a crop in their
backyard and give their garden the tender loving
care it deserves. You can pay close attention to
your plants' soil, water, and nutrient needs.
Growing cannabis in your flower and vegetable
garden is ideal because you can care for all your
plants at the same time.

planting holes or garden beds. Turn it over and
make sure it has plenty of amendments (see
Chapter Ten). Always put a heavy layer of mulch
on any soil that will be planted! A 12-inch-plus
(30 cm+) layer of mulch will keep soil elements
intact as well as attract moisture. Bare soil loses
most of its valuable topsoil to erosion during
winter months.
In the spring, mulched amended soil should
be well-mixed and ready for planting. You can
transplant cannabis seedlings or clones in the
garden just like you would tomatoes. If your
soil is poor, or you didn't begin cultivation in fall,
dig large holes, three feet (90 cm) in diameter
by three feet (90 cm) deep, and fill with your
best compost, potting soil, or planting mix.
Otherwise, break up the top six to eight inches
(15-20 cm) of soil in a six-foot (1.8 m) radius to
provide room for root branching.
Bury containers in a garden bed so they do not
stick out too much. They can be easily moved
indoors at night or to a remote location.

Put pots inside another container to protect roots
from being cooked by heat from the sun.

Terrace Growing
Growing in containers on a terrace, balcony, or
roof is very rewarding. A small sunny location,
good genetics, containers, and good soil are the
basic needs.
Your gardening techniques will depend upon
the location of the grow show. City building
rooftops, terraces, and balconies tend to be
windy. The higher the garden, the more wind.
Wind dries plants quickly. See "Wind" in this
chapter.
Patio gardens are most often protected from
strong winds and strong sunlight.
An automatic watering system is often a good
idea in such gardens to ensure they receive
adequate water, especially if you are gone for
a few days.
Pots will also need to be shaded from sunlight.
Hot sun beating down on pots cooks plant roots.

Containers with wheels are much easier to
move, especially if you are moving them back
and forth from indoors to outdoors.
Even with adequate security, the standard
issues of water, soil, and fertilizer apply. For a
successful crop, daily maintenance is essential
during hot and windy weather.
Wind can carry rogue male pollen or indus¬
trial hemp pollen creating problems for terrace
growers. Plan ahead. See "Rogue Pollen" on

Coastal winds tend to flow inland during the day

Guerilla Growing
Guerilla growing, a term coined in the early
1970s, requires strategy, time, and most often,
physical prowess. Depending upon your location
and local laws, clandestine guerilla growing in
remote locations could be your only option.
Location and security are the main concerns
for a guerilla grower. Choose a location that
has limited public access. Check regulations
for hunting and recreation, and think of who
might be using the area: hunters, mushroomers,
other marijuana growers, hikers, dirt-bikers, Boy
Scouts, etc. Select a remote site unlikely to be
used casually.
Look for a site that already has big green
stands of vegetation. Marijuana is a vigorous
plant with a large root system, and a flowering
female will stand out if surrounding vegeta¬
tion dies back before harvest. Stands of thorny
blackberry bushes, ferns, and meadow grass are
good options.
Prepare your marijuana patch up to six months
before planting. Remove green vegetation in
the fall for a spring garden. Clear a few patches
to allow sufficient sunshine, cut back roots of
competing plants, and till planting holes two- to
three-feet square (60-90 cm2). If possible, allow
amended soil to sit for a month or longer before
planting. Remote locations are hard to visit on
a regular basis, so proper planning and prepa¬
ration is important. If your home and guerilla
gardens are similar, you can plant an indicator
crop like tomatoes as a backyard guide to your
hidden plants' condition.

OUTDOORS

Coastal breezes generally carry air from land
out to sea at night. Valleys and exposed hillsides
experience more wind.

Ample water is an important factor for site
selection. If you cannot count on rainfall, locate
your garden near a water source that does
not dry up in the summer; doing so will make
watering easier and cut the chance of being
spotted hauling water. Exclusive access by boat
will reduce the risk of discovery, but make sure
your plants cannot be seen from the boat. Many
people use waterways and explore land border¬
ing rivers.

Cool air tends to sit in natural and man-made
valleys which are often a few degrees cooler.

The angle of the sun climbs during the summer,
and it is also brighter.

139

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER'S BIBLE
Plants need a minimum of five to six hours
of sunshine a day. Scout sites in the winter and
try to visualize how the trees will cast shadows
during the summer months. Remember that the
sun takes a higher path in the spring and sum¬
mer. Five hours of direct midday sun per day is
essential for acceptable growth. More is better.
Rocky terrain, hillside terraces, and grasslands all
receive good amounts of sunlight.
Wind patterns will affect your garden and
influence where plants are located. Do your
homework. Research average wind direction and
force. Windbreaks protect plants from heat and
water loss.
Planting in a corn field offers plenty of cover.

Security
A secure location is the number one concern
for most guerilla growers. Indoor growers can
rent an apartment, house, or warehouse in the
name of another person to avoid discovery.
Guerilla gardens planted on public land risk
detection by hikers, fishermen, or other outdoor
enthusiasts. Remember, they are interested in
specific sports and recreation. They will not go
out of their way to find your patch unless you
lead them to it.

Cannabis plants easily blend into other foliage
when planted properly.

Plant in a secure location that is out of sight! A greenhouse or a field of cannabis is vulnerable to both

Be prepared with a believable story about why
you are hiking around. Some possible ideas
include bird watching, fishing, wildflower pho¬

etc., to corroborate your story. Stay alert; this is
risky business!
Some growers prefer to visit their patch late in
the afternoon when the bulk of visitors are most
likely to be in the forest. Now you will have
plenty of time to complete tasks, and when the
sun sets, you can return under the secure veil
of twilight.
If you prefer to visit your grow show in the
early morning when it is dark, a flashlight with a
red or green lens helps your eyes adjust.
Always carry a cell phone to call for help or to
communicate with a partner while at the patch.
Turn the ringer off!
Prevent making a distinguishable path to the
patch by taking a different route every visit. Walk
142

on logs, rocks, and up stream beds to avoid
detection. Rapid growth of native plants will
erase any obvious trail. You can fertilize to assist
in repairs, but be careful with application as
wild plants are easily over-fertilized. Remember,
in late summer and early fall, most native plants
in dry climates will not regrow.
Bring growing supplies to the patch and stock¬
pile them over time-PVC pipe, gasoline-pow¬
ered pumps, water tanks, soil, bricks of coconut
fiber, compost, etc.-and hide them discreetly.
You can take a few things to the patch each
time. Make these trips count; plan ahead.
Prevent the style, size, and sole pattern of your
shoes from leaving discernible tracks that could
lead thieves and cops to your patch. Your shoe
print could be used as evidence against you if
your patch is busted!
Camouflage plants by bending, pruning, or
splitting the stem down the middle. Bending
branches is the least traumatic and has more
subtle effects on hormones, liquid flow, and
physical shape. See "Pruning and Bending" in
Chapter Three. You can split the main stem
(and the plant) down the middle and stretch
the halves horizontally to create an espalier.
Pruning produces the strongest effect because
it removes the high concentrations of hormones
in the terminal buds and stimulates lateral
growth. Pruning several main stems may make
the plants less obvious but does not improve
harvest. Think carefully about desired outcome
before cutting.
Grow in sticker bushes or other unpleasant
foliage such as poison oak, poison ivy, sting¬
ing nettles, etc, to discourage intruders. Look
for bushes that are dense and high enough to
shelter the patch from view. This deters large
animals or people from wandering into the site.
Protect yourself from these plants with a slick
rain suit and gloves. Wash after each visit to
remove irritating toxic oils and thorns.

Some growers climb 30 feet or higher up into
the trees to plant on stands in the canopy or use
deer and elk stands as growing platforms.
Set up a pulley system to lift large containers
and potting soil up to the platform. Install an
irrigation hose from the base of the tree up to
the planting area and arrange around the pots
so you can perform weekly watering with a
battery powered pump rather than climbing the
tree. Find a partner to stand lookout when you
are working in the canopy, and be sure to use
safety lines. Do not overextend yourself. I used
to climb trees for a living, and my hard and fast
rule was to spend no more than four hours
climbing per day. When you get tired, accidents
happen. If you hurt yourself, you will not be able

An easy, inexpensive way to feed and water

fill with water and water-soluble fertilizer. Place
one bucket by each plant with the hole oriented
near the stem. Buckets should be refilled every

Harden-off before moving outside into the

One grower I know keeps a stream of plants
moving from indoors to his outdoor gardens. He
plants the first crop of clones in three-gallon (11
L) pots in a greenhouse, hardens them off, and
moves them to their final location. The second
crop is moved into the greenhouse when the
first crop is moved out. He repeats this process
three to four times during the season.
A complete low-maintenance setup is the
goal for most guerilla growers. Loosen the soil,
amend it, and throw in a handful of polymers
to retain moisture. A thick layer of mulch, early
in the year, will attract water, keep the soil cool,
and prevent evaporation. Bury clones deep in
the ground to promote a deep root system that
will not require a lot of additional water.
Some growers transplant one-foot (30 cm)
tall clones with smaller root systems by remov¬
ing the first few sets of leaves and burying the
root ball deeper with only six inches (15 cm) of
foliage left above ground. Roots will grow along
the underground stem in a few weeks. Deep
roots will create more self-sufficient plants. This
is of particular importance in extremely remote
areas that are hard to get to and in the moun¬
tains where the rainfall may be sporadic.
Pest prevention is crucial for guerilla crops,
because the patch is too difficult to maintain
every day or week. It is easier to keep pests
from attacking plants in the first place than to
try and do damage control later.
Water and fertilize as needed. See chapters
in this book that pertain to specific outdoor

Harvest
Harvest before cold, damp, autumn weather
sets in. This weather causes fungus-botrytis
(bud mold) and powdery mildew. Many plants
can take a short mild freeze (30-32°F [-1-0°C]).
But if the temperature stays below freezing for
more than a few hours, it could kill plants. Pay
close attention to weather forecasts and apply
the information to the microclimate where your
plants are growing. Be ready to harvest quickly
if weather dictates.
Law enforcement can force a harvest, too.
Limit potential discovery by hunters, hikers,
and cops by harvesting at night. Find out when
police or rangers are in the area, and plan to be
there at a different time. Police scanners that
pick up local police activities can come in handy
for determining their location.
Take a sharp pocket knife and a backpack to
haul your crop incognito. If you are harvesting
more than one variety, put them in separate
bags or wrap in newspaper before they go in
the backpack.
Determine a believable story to explain your
presence in the area, including proximity to
the garden, should you be discovered. Offer
nothing, explain little, and keep it simple so you
don't slip. Always remember Bart Simpson's
words, "I didn't do it. Nobody saw me. You can't
prove a thing!"

mation on flowering and harvest timing.

Extending Seasons
Many products protect plants from cold
weather and high winds, allowing growers to
cultivate earlier and later in the year than would
normally be possible.
The easiest and most cost-effective approach
to extending the growing season is to locate
and take advantage of microclimates such as
areas that warm up faster or retain heat longer.

made out of materials-bricks, mortar, stonethat will hold the heat and can even prevent

freeze-thaw cycles all play a part in evaluating
microclimates.
Dark rocks can moderate temperature in a
very small area by soaking up the heat of the
day then releasing it slowly as the evening tem¬
perature cools.
Dark walls and soil will absorb and hold more
heat than their light-colored counterparts. Or
use plastic mulch which will shade weeds, pre¬
vent moisture loss, and raise the temperature
of the soil by 5-15°F (3-8°C) on a sunny day.
As plants grow, the leaves will shade the plastic
and stop the warming effects.
A lake, pond, or small creek will also moder¬
ate air temperature, keeping it warmer in winter
and cooler in the summer.
Cloches are individual protective coverings
that keep plants warm at night. A simple cloche
is a milk container with the bottom cut off and
the lid removed. Placed over a plant, the plastic
will capture and retain heat while allowing
ventilation through the open top. You can make
cloches out of wax paper, glass, and jars, or
buy them. Commercial units are made of rigid
transparent plastic or heavy-duty wax paper.
146

They are easy to use and stack
well for storage.
The Wall O' Water is a plant
lifesaver. It is a water-filled
teepee which uses the heatemitting properties of water to
shield plants from excess heat
and keep them warm in the
cold. It holds three gallons (11.5
L) of water and fits over the
plant. During the day, the water
absorbs the heat of the sun,
moderating the temperature
inside the teepee. At night, as
the air temperature drops, the
water releases its heat, keeping
the plant comfortable. The Wall
O’ Water does its best work in
the spring when there is still
a chance of freezing. As water
freezes, it releases more heat
into the teepee and can protect
plants down to 20°F (-7°C).
Covers protect early plants and can help pro¬
duce a spring crop. The most uncomplicated
cover is a sheet or blanket spread over the plant
and held down with stones or soil. A low watt¬
age electric light bulb carefully placed under
the cover will raise the temperature 10-15°F
(5.5-8°C) above that of the rest of the garden.
Be very carefui that the light bulb does not
touch any part of the cover, or it may start a
fire. Products such as Agronet™ and Reemay™
are spun-fiber with sun-protection properties
that can be used as covers in place of the sheet
or blanket.
Row tunnels can be made of clear corrugated
fiberglass that is bent into an arch and secured
over the garden. Commercial row covers come
in many sizes from large enough for dwarf fruit
trees to smaller units for pepper plants and
rose bushes. Those made with polypropylene
will protect plants down to 25°F
(-5°C).

(Eur $106 per kg)

Space: First grow: 16' 5" x 7' 10" (5 x 2.4 m), Second and third grows: 33' x 7' 10"
(10 x 2.4 m)

Watts: First grow - 6000 watts, second and third grows - 8400 watts.
Cloning: 100 clones (first crop) and 400 clones (second and third crops) purchased from
an outside source and ready for planting. Clones were purchased for USD $3.15 each
(Eur $2.50 each). The strain supplied was Power Plant.

Vegetative: First crop - 100 clones were planted directly into flowering room and given 18
hours of light per day for a period of 14 days. For the second and third crops, 400 clones
were used. Because the number of plants grown per square meter was doubled, only
seven days of vegetative growth were needed pre-flowering.

The First Crop
Nigel and Terry lived together in Central
London and worked for the same large
British company. When both were offered
a transfer to a new firm in Holland, they
jumped at the chance. The new company
was in the west, near the coast, and in close
proximity to some picturesque rural districts.
They rented a house in the countryside
where they could enjoy the solitude and
reduce the stress associated with corporate
life.
The house they rented was on a large piece
of land, not in direct view of any neighbors.
Near the house was a big shed once used
to service farm equipment. It had power,
water, and a functioning toilet and shower.
Interesting?
After settling in at work and making the
house comfortable, Nigel and Terry got
to thinking. "That shed's just sitting there
empty, and wouldn’t it be just perfect for
a hydro setup?" As it turned out, the prop¬
erty they rented was owned by an elderly
woman who lived in Belgium. The rent was
paid to a real estate agent in town, and no
neighbors had even spoken to them in the
six weeks since they moved in, so they fig¬
ured the place was pretty safe. After a few
nights sitting up and discussing their pros¬
pects, the lads decided to capitalize on their
good fortune, and "go for the grow!!"
At the back of the shed was a storage area
that had been partitioned off from the rest.
It spanned the entire width of the building,
about 33 feet (10 m) and was approximately
10 feet (3 m) wide. This seemed like an
ideal place for the new project, but a few
questions arose. Exactly how big were they
going to make this thing? How much cash
were they willing to invest? What were the
consequences of success versus failure, or
worse, discovery? Being corporate minded,
the lads decided to make an executive deci¬
sion. Seek advice from a professional.
Holland is world-renowned for its indoor
weed production; consequently, grow shops

are abundant. Nigel and Terry found the
staff at their nearest "grow-op" to be open,
professional, and well equipped to deal with
their specific inquiries. After an enlightening
chat, the boys decided to play it safe and
use only half the area of the storage room
16 feet 6 inches x 10 feet (5x3 m). They
figured that organic was the way to go, and
the simplest growing method (pots and soil)
would be best for starters.
They bought enough timber and other
materials to construct two benches 16 feet 6
inches long x 4 feet wide (5 x 1.2 m). They
bought 100 1.3-gallon (5 L) plastic pots, ten
13-gallon (50 L) bags of organic potting soil,
and enough white, laminated wooden pan¬
elling to cover the walls (approximately 36
sq ft [30 sq m] ). The idea was to construct
the basic room, fill the pots with soil, place
them on the benches, and check that the
design was solid before progressing further.
All went together well, total expense USD
$780 (Eur $620).
This system was relatively easy to set up.
The inline fan was installed high up on the
rear wall. Its job was to expel hot air from
the grow room and create enough draw to
pull cool air in through a vent (iarge gap)
between the opposite wall and the grow
room floor. When and if smell became a
problem, the carbon filter could be connect¬
ed to the Torin and its fan speed increased
to maintain constant odor-free airflow. The
two pedestal fans would be incorporated
to increase air movement but not until all
else was set up. The lamps were arranged
to cover an area of approximately 3 feet 3
inches x 3 feet 11 inches (1.0 x 1.2 m) each.
The reflectors supplied with the lighting
kits were cheap, half-octagon, aluminium
horizontal hoods. However, they were
lightweight and seemed very bright when
the lights were turned on.
Clones were potted and placed on the
benches (ten under each lamp). For the first
five or six days, the lights were kept about
one meter above the plants, then gradually

lowered to about half that height as growth
became healthy and vigorous. Watering was
done by hand, and because the soil was a
premixed organic blend, no extra fertilizer
was added for the first week.
Nigel and Terry hovered over this first crop
like proud fathers. They adhered to a daily
schedule of watering, monitoring pH, and
inspecting leaves for signs of insect attack
and nutrient imbalance. As a result, the
plants developed quickly and were ready to
begin flowering by the end of the second
week. To induce flowering, the lights were
set back from 18 to 12 hours per day. About
this time, they began to add organic nutrient
supplements to the daily soak. As the plants
developed further, they worked up quite a
thirst; all pots were watered until their indi¬
vidual drip trays nearly overflowed.
The carbon filter was connected around
week 6, in an effort to prevent odors escap¬
ing the shed. This tactic worked well, but it
reduced airflow. As the plants increased in
size and density, it became increasingly diffi¬
cult to keep grow room temperatures below
86°F (30°C). On a couple of occasions, the
temperature rose above 91 °F (33°C), and
bud development definitely suffered. The
guys remember one time when every plant
stopped growing for three or four days after
the room overheated.
As their crop approached maturity, Nigel
and Terry noticed something strange going
on. Most plants were finishing off nicely, but
some (generally the biggest) didn't seem to
be maturing properly. The buds on the plants
growing right under the lamps were big but
didn't seem as solid or as resinous as those
on the other plants. This condition became
more noticeable as time progressed. By the
8-week mark, the larger plants started to go
a bit yellow and drop leaves. It was time to
pull the pin on this caboose!
The crop was harvested a few days later
and hung to dry. In general, the smaller
plants produced better quality buds than the
larger plants. The yield was 8.4 pounds (3.8

kg) of very nice weed, and with that in hand,
who was going to complain?
Actually, the boys were very happy with
their first result, as everything ran quite
smoothly. They had a few problems with
heat, but they learned a lot and gained the
confidence (and the $) to expand their room
to its full potential, 33 feet x 10 feet (10 x
3 m).

The Second Crop
This was a time of change and serious
improvement. Over the past three months,
Nigel and Terry had visited the local hydro
store on many occasions and had struck up
a friendship with one of the owners who
worked there. He had given them heaps
of useful advice, and the boys realized that
without his input, the first crop could have
easily ended in failure.
The storeowner (we'll call him Bob) offered
to help the boys design their new double¬
sized room, provided they purchase all their
new equipment from him, of course. He
insisted that the system they were currently
running used too much power, generated
too much heat, and was too labor-inten¬
sive to be successfully doubled in size and
maintained by two guys already working
full-time jobs. As usual, Bob was talking
sense, so Nigel and Terry decided it was a
safe bet to play it Bob's way and part with
the necessary cash. The total cost of Bob's
proposed improvements weighed in at USD
$7552 (Eur $6000). Calculating at a rate of
Eur $2200/kilo, the first crop paid for itself
and more than half the expenses of the pro¬
posed expansion and improvements. Cool!
Bob's plan was to: 1. Double the length of
the existing two benches and line the walls
of the other half of the storage area with
white laminated wood; 2. Set up an auto¬
matic watering system with a large reservoir
to reduce manual labor; 3. Plant double
the amount of clones per area to reduce
time in vegetation by a week; 4. To achieve
adequate air flow, install a new 5000 cu/hr

fan for air extraction, and use their existing
3200 cu/hr fan for air intake; 5. Make use
of current advancements in reflector tech¬
nology to decrease the number of lights
required-from 20 to 14-and consequently
reduce the power usage and heat genera¬
tion by the same ratio; 6. Bob also suggested
ditching the pot idea in favor of cocopeat
slabs. "Just supply the plants with a topquality organic nutrient, and the garden will
be state-of-the-art and organic."
The room was set up pretty much as Bob
had planned. Look at the photo on page 162
to see an example. Five Danish-made plastic
6 foot 6 inch x 3 foot 3 inch (2 x 1 m) trays
were loaded up with coco mats and placed
on each 33 foot (10 m) long bench top. Each
tray was installed with a 3-degree tilt to pro¬
mote drainage. An elaborate system of drip¬
pers and drainage pipes was constructed
and each bench was run as a separate entity
with its own 400-liter reservoir and 6000
L/hr pump. Both pumps were timed to run
x times a day for y minutes, and nutrient
runoff was pumped out of the grow room
and into the shower drain.
The fans were installed placing the 5000
cu/hr fan high at one end of the room and
the 3200 cu/hr fan down low at the other.
The 5000 removed air via the vent in the
upper central part of the room. The vent was
box-shaped and permanently connected to
the carbon filter. When the filter was not
required, a cover on the under side of the
box was removed, and air was drawn out
through the exposed opening. The 3200
forced cool air through ductwork that ran
along the floor under each bench. This air
entered the room in four places under each
bench, equally spaced along their length.
Four pedestal fans were used to mix the air
and push it in the general direction of the
outlet vent.
The room was lit using fourteen 600-watt
lamps, each covering an area of 4 feet 8
inches x 3 feet 11 inches (1.43 x 1.2 m).
This was achieved by using high-tech adjust¬

able double-parabolic reflectors (Adjust-aWings). These flexible "wings" were highly
reflective and could spread light evenly and
broadly at a range of heights above the
plants. They were rated to cover areas of 4
feet 11 inches x 4 feet 1 inch (1.5 x 1.25 m)
and above with 600-watt lamps, so 4 feet 8
inches x 3 feet 11 inches (1.43 x 1.2 m) was
within prescribed limits. Another lighting
product was used in conjunction with the
wings and referred to as a Super Spreader.
These fit below the lamp and spread excess
light and heat from that hot area across the
light's entire footprint. They allow lamps to
be close to plants to produce rapid growth
but keep growth rate and plant size even.
When compared to the first, this crop
almost seemed to grow itself! The irrigation
system alone (reservoir size, how many days
reserve, nutrient dosing, the coco/Danish
tray/run to waste system) saved Nigel and
Terry about two hours a day.
The ventilation design combined well with
the simple, effective lighting strategy. Air
was pumped in and pushed up from below,
cooling plants and lights on its way up. The
heated air would rise naturally, be trapped
by the ceiling, sucked towards the vent/filter,
and exhausted from the room. With a small
amount of adjustment, the air temperature
could be maintained at 80-82°F (27°C to
28°C) even when the plants formed a dense
mass across the whole room.
The wing reflectors could be adjusted to
provide even lighting when they were close
to the plants (growth and flowering phases)
and when they were farther away (early veg¬
etative and final maturation phases). When
reflectors were hung low over the plants,
the spreaders dealt with any hot spots and
insured even lighting.
Nigel and Terry's second crop grew vigor¬
ously and evenly all the way through to
maturity. They had a small problem early on
with spider mites. Seems the clones they
bought had a few mites onboard. The mites
were dealt with organically and effectively.

Bob had suggested the boys use Ecolizer
organic nutrients and follow their program
exactly. The program suggested misting
clones regularly with their "Bugs Away" foliar
feed. This solution contains nutrition plus
essential oils that coat mite eggs and suffo¬
cate them. No chemicals and it worked!
After a total of nine weeks growing, the
room was filled with plants that formed a
dense layer of evenly developed, sticky, fat
bud. The room resembled a "sea of green"
rather than a collection of plants of assorted
size and shape. As they harvested, Nigel and
Terry joked about mowing down a mass of
sticky green corn cobs. Cutting, hanging, dry¬
ing, and particularly manicuring this much
weed was one hell of a job and took them
a month to finish. The final yield was 12.5
kilos and the quality was A+.
At this point, the boys had covered all their
expenses, they were almost half way into
their third crop (which was growing strong),
and were already 10 kilos in the black. This
had been an ambitious project. Nigel and

Terry had not achieved success without sig¬
nificant risk and a lot of hard work! Guess
who was planning a well deserved "holiday
in da sun"?

RDEN CALENDAR
Calendar and Checklist
A calendar helps growers know what to
do and when to prepare to do it. A checklist
adds necessary routine to the process. The
calendar outlines the average three-month
life cycle of clones. It notes major points of
interest during each stage in life. The weekly
checklist consists of a few things that must
be done every week to ensure a successful
crop.
Savvy growers read and consider each and
every point on the calendar weekly. They
mark each point with a check when finished
with it.
Growers should spend at least 10 minutes
per day, per lamp, to have a productive
garden. This is enough time to complete
all the stuff on the weekly calendar. Much
of gardening is simply watching and paying
attention, but it takes time to have a decent,
productive garden. If using C02 enrichment

or hydroponics, allow 20 minutes per day
for maintenance.
Large chunks of time will be spent setting
up the grow room and harvesting. These
are not included in the 10-20 minute daily
schedule.

Calendar
The calendar starts on January 1st and
is only three months long. Two weeks for
clones to stick (root), two weeks of vegeta¬
tive growth, and eight weeks of flowering.
This indoor calendar can be started any day
of the year, no matter which direction the
wind is blowing or what the weatherman
says.
If the garden is full of clones grown with
C02 enrichment or hydroponically, the cal¬
endar could move up one week, depending
on how fast the garden grows. Remember,
light intensity substantially diminishes over
four feet away from the bulb.

j Weekly Checklist
Check the following to see if they
function properly:
• Air ventilation
• Air circulation
• Humidity: 40-60 percent - flowering
• Humidity: 60-70 percent - vegetative
• Temperature: day 70-75°F (21-24°C);
night 60-65°F (16-19°C)
• Soil moisture (dry pockets) water as
needed
• Cultivate soil surface
• Check pH
• Rotate (turn) plants
• Check for spider mites under leaves
• Check for fungi
• Check for nutrient deficiencies
• Regular fertilization schedule
• Check HID system for excessive heat at
plug-in, timer, ballast, and near ceiling
• Cleanup!
• Cleanup!
• Check walls and ceiling for mold
• Move lamp up, 12-36 inches above

Introduction
Light, Spectrum, and Photoperiod
Marijuana needs light to grow. The light must
have the proper spectrum and intensity to ensure
rapid growth. Light is comprised of separate bands
of colors. Each color in the spectrum sends the
plant a separate signal. Each color in the spectrum
promotes a different type of growth.

PAR and Light Spectrum
Spectrum of A. Photosynthetic response, B. Light spectrum
humans use to see, C. Chlorophyll synthesis

This graph shows the exact level at which A. Phototropic
response, B. Photosynthetic response, and C. Chlorophyll
synthesis take place.

Plants need and use only certain portions of
the light spectrum. The most important colors in
the spectrum for maximum chlorophyll produc¬
tion and photosynthetic response are in the blue
and red range. The main portion of light used by
plants is between 400 and 700 nanometers (nm) *
This region is called the Photosynthetically Active
Radiation (PAR) zone.**
"PAR watts" is the measure of the actual amount
of specific photons a plant needs to grow. Photons
are a measure of light energy. Light energy is radi¬
ated and assimilated in photons. Photosynthesis is
necessary for plants to grow and is activated by the
assimilation of photons. Blue photons are worth
more PAR watts than red photons, but scientists

*One nanometer (nm) = one billionth (109) of
a meter. Light is measured in wavelengths; the
wavelengths are measured in nanometers.
**Some scientists still disagree as to the exact PAR
zone and make their calculations based on 350 to
750 nanometers. PAR watts measured with this scale
will be a little higher.

ible to the human eye. The human eye sees much
less of the light spectrum than plants "see." The eye
is most sensitive to light between 525-625 nanome¬
ters. The importance of the blue and red portions
in the spectrum is diminished greatly when light
is measured in foot-candles, lux, or lumens. A footcandle is a unit of illumination equal to the intensity
of one candle at a distance of one foot. The lux scale

emits. Bulbs with a Kelvin temperature from 3000
to 6500 are best for growing marijuana. The PAR
section explains that plants use specific portions of
the spectrum-a complete range from blues to reds.
Lamps with a spectrum similar to PAR-rated bulbs
can use Kelvin temperature of a bulb to ascertain
the approximate PAR rating of the lamp. Color spec¬
trum results from a specific mix of different colors.
High intensity discharge bulbs are very similar in
spectrum. Making these safe assumptions, a rough
PAR rating could be extrapolated from a Kelvin
temperature rating.
The Color Corrected Temperature (CCT) of a bulb
is the peak Kelvin temperature at which the colors
in a bulb are stable. We can classify bulbs by their
CCT rating which tells us the overall color of the
light emitted. It does not tell us the concentration of
the combination of colors emitted. Companies use
a Color Rendering Index (CRI). The higher the CRI,
the better the bulb is for growing.

Light Meters
Most commercial light meters measure light in
foot-candles or lux. Both scales measure light to
which the human eye reacts to "see." They do not
measure photosynthetic response to light in PAR
watts.
Light measurements in this book are made in
foot-candles and lux. This information is still valu¬
able, because it records the amount of light spread
over a specific surface. The information is then
coupled with the PAR rating of different bulbs.
Regardless of the lamp, the amount of light emitted

Although this simple light meter measures light in footcandles rather than PAR, it still gives an accurate idea of
light distribution.

is constant. It only makes sense to use the proper
reflective hood with a high PAR-rated bulb to grow
the best garden.

LIGHT, LAMPS & ELECTRICITY

After all the talk about PAR watts, industry offi¬
cials are unable to agree on a common scale of
measurement. For this reason, we have decided to
rely on Kelvin color temperature to measure lamp
spectrum.

Photoperiod
The photoperiod is the relationship between the
duration of the light period and dark period. Most
strains of marijuana will stay in the vegetative
growth stage as long as an 18 to 24-hour light and
a 6 to 0-hour dark photoperiod are maintained.
However, there are exceptions. Eighteen hours of
light per day will give marijuana all the light it needs
to sustain vegetative growth.
Flowering is most efficiently induced with 12
hours of uninterrupted darkness in a 24-hour pho¬
toperiod. When plants are at least two months
old-after they have developed sexual characteristics-altering the photoperiod to an even 12 hours,
day and night, will induce visible signs of flowering
in one to three weeks. Older plants tend to show
signs of flowering sooner. Varieties originating in
the tropics generally mature later. The 12-hour
photoperiod represents the classic equinox and
is the optimum daylight-to-dark relationship for

Give plants 36 hours of total darkness just before inducing flowering with the 12/12 photoperiod.
This heavy dose of darkness sends plants an unmistakable signal to flower sooner. Growers using this
technique report that plants normally show signs of flowering, such as pistil formation, within two
weeks and develop pistils after a week of flowering.
Growers have experimented with giving plants up to 48 hours of total darkness to jump-start
flowering and have found that 36 hours-three contiguous 12-hour nights-is most effective.

photoperiod. Again, the hours of light necessary
to induce flowering in an /nd/ca-dominant plant is
contingent upon the genetics in the strain. More
hours of light during flowering can cause some
strains to produce bigger plants with reduced
flowering time, but some growers have reported
looser, leafier buds as a result.
Giving any cannabis variety less than 12 hours
of uninterrupted darkness will not make it flow¬
er faster. Instead, the plant will take longer to
mature, its buds will be smaller, and the overall
harvest will be lessened.
Genetically unstable strains could

plants and could produce hermaphrodites.
Some

growers

experiment with

gradually

decreasing daylight hours while increasing hours
of darkness. They do this to simulate the natu¬
ral photoperiod outdoors. This practice prolongs
flowering and does not increase yield.
The photoperiod signals plants to start flower¬
ing; it can also signal them to remain in (or revert
to) vegetative growth. Marijuana must have 12
hours of uninterrupted, total darkness to flower
properly. Dim light during the dark period in
the pre-flowering and flowering stages prevents
marijuana from blooming. When the 12-hour dark
period is interrupted by light, plants get confused.
The light signals plants, "It's daytime; start vegeta¬
tive growth." Given this signal of light, plants start
vegetative growth, and flowering is retarded or
stopped.

Turn on a green light bulb to work in the indoor garden
at night. Green light will not affect the photoperiod of
flowering plants.

164

Marijuana will not stop flowering if the lights
are turned on for a few minutes once or twice
during the flowering cycle. If a light is turned on

Chapter NINE

for a few minutes-long enough to disrupt the
dark period-on two or three consecutive nights,
plants will start to revert to vegetative growth.
Less than one haif of one foot-candle of light
will prevent cannabis from flowering. That is a
little more light than reflected by a full moon on
a clear night. Well-bred indica-dominant plants
will revert within three days. Sof/Va-dominant
plants take four to five days to revert to veg¬
etative growth. Once they start to re-vegetate,
it takes four to six additional weeks to induce
flowering!
When light shines on a green object, green
pigment in the object absorbs all spectrum

This is why we see the color green.

High intensity discharge lamps are bright-very,

intense brightness harvest more weed per watt.
Intensity is the magnitude of light energy per unit

rapidly as it moves away from the source.

The Inverse Square Law dictates light intensity in relation to distance.

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER’S BIBLE
For example, plants that are two feet from a lamp
receive one-fourth the amount of light received by
plants one foot away! An HID that emits 100,000
lumens produces a paltry 25,000 lumens two feet
(60 cm) away, A 1000-watt HID that emits 100,000
initial lumens yields 11,111 lumens three feet (90

Increase yield by giving growing area uniform

Foliage in dimly lit areas is shaded when light distri¬

Reflective hoods ultimately dictate lamp place¬

plants. Nearly all stationary lamps have bright (hot)
spots that plants grow toward.
Growers prefer high-wattage lamps-400, 600,

bulb, when properly set up, they actually deliver
more usable light to plants. The 600-watt bulb
has the highest lumen-per-watt conversion (150
LPW) and can be placed closer to the canopy of
the garden than 1000 or 1100-watt bulbs. When
the 600-watt bulb is closer to plants, they receive
more light.
A 1000-watt HID emits a lot of light. It also radiates
a lot of heat. The bulb must be farther away from
the plants to avoid burning them. In many cases
it is more effective to use smaller wattage bulbs.

This gardener is able to rotate and move plants around

For example, two 400-watt bulbs can be placed

within the garden beds. Wheels on the bed make it easy

closer to plants than one 1000-watt bulb, and the

to rotate or remove entire beds.

400-watt bulbs emit light from two points. The dis¬
advantage is that two 400-watt systems cost more
than one 1000-watt system.
Check out the diagrams that show the difference
in usable light in different sized growing areas.
Growers who use these drawings fine-tune the area

Look at the simple mathematical examples below
to see how much more efficient 400 and 600-watt
lamps are than 1000-watt lamps.
For example, a 1000-watt lamp that produces

Use the examples above to see the 1000-watt HP
sodium offers more watts per square foot and m2 to
achieve the desired lumen output of 10,000 lumens.
However, the bulb also produces a hot spot near the
center of the illuminated area. Plants tend to grow
into the hot spot and shade other plants.
Although 400-watt lamps have a lower lumenper-watt conversion, when used properly they may
be more efficient than higher wattage bulbs. One
1000-watt halide produces 115,000 initial lumens
and a 400-watt halide only 40,000. This means each
400-watt lamp must be located closer to the canopy
of the garden to provide a similar amount of light. It
also means that several different point sources sus¬
tain more even, intense light distribution.

around the bulb. To promote growth, light must
penetrate the dense foliage of a garden. The lamps
are mounted where light intensity is marginal-along
the walls-to provide sidelight.
Compact fluorescent lamps are not a good choice
forsidelighting when using HIDIamps.(See"Compact

Move plants around under the lamp so they receive
the most possible light. Move smaller plants toward
the center and taller plants toward the outside of
the garden. Set small plants on a stand to even
out the garden profile. Arrange plants in a concave
shape (stadium method) under the lamp so all plants
receive the same amount of light. Containers with
wheels are easier to move.
Take advantage of the different levels of light below
the HID. Place seedlings and cuttings requiring low
light levels on the perimeter and flowering plants
needing higher light levels under bright bulbs.

light energy available to lower leaves. If the lower
leaves do not receive enough light, they will yellow
and die. Tall six-foot (1.8 m) plants take longer to
grow and have higher overall yields than shorter
four-foot (1.2 m) plants, but the yield of primo tops
will be about the same. Due to lack of light, the
taller plants have large flowers on the top three to
four feet (90-120 cm) and spindly buds nearer the
bottom. Tall plants tend to develop heavy flower
tops whose weight the stem cannot support. These
plants need to be tied up. Short plants better sup¬
port the weight of the tops and have much more
flower weight than leaf weight.
At least 99 two-week-old seedlings or clones
can be huddled directly under a single 400-watt
HID. The young plants will need more space as
they grow. If packed too closely together, plants
sense the shortage of space and do not grow to
their maximum potential. Leaves from one plant
shade another plant's foliage and slow overall plant
growth. It is very important to space young plants
just far enough apart so their leaves do not touch
or touch very little. This will keep shading to a mini¬
mum and growth to a maximum. Check and alter
the spacing every few days. Eight to sixteen mature
females three to four months old will completely fill
the space under one 1000-watt HID.
Plants can absorb light only if it falls on their
leaves. Plants must be spaced so their leaves do not
overlap too much. Yield increases very little when
plants are crowded. Plants also stretch for light,

Reflective Hoods
Some reflective hoods reflect light more evenly
than others. A reflector that distributes light evenly-with no hot spots-can be placed closer to plants
without burning them. These hoods are most effi¬
cient, because the lamp is closer and the light more
intense. The farther the lamp is from the garden, the
less light plants receive. For example, a 1000-watt
reflector with a "hot spot" must be placed 36 inches
(90 cm) above the garden. A 600-watt lamp with a
reflector that distributes light evenly can be placed
only 18 inches above the garden. When placed
closer, the 600-watt lamp shines as much light on
the garden as the 1000-watt bulb!
The proper reflective hood over the lamp and
reflective walls can double the growing area.
Growers who use the most efficient reflective hoods
harvest up to twice as much as those who don't.
Seedlings, cuttings, and plants in the vegetative
growth stage need less light than flowering plants,
because their growth requirements are different. For
the first few weeks of life, seedlings and clones can
easily survive beneath fluorescent lights. Vegetative
growth requires a little more light, easily supplied
by a metal halide or compact fluorescent lamps.

Reflective hoods are made from steel sheet
metal, aluminum, even stainless steel. The steel
is either cold-rolled or pre-galvanized before
a reflective coating is applied. Pre-galvanized
steel is more rust resistant than cold-rolled
steel. This metal can be polished, textured or
painted, with white being the most common
paint color. Premium hood manufacturers apply

white paint in a powder-coating process. Note:
there are different shades of white, and some
whites are whiter than others. Flat titanium
white is the most reflective color and diffuses
light most effectively. Glossy white paint is easy
to clean but tends to create hot spots of light.
Sheet metal hoods are less expensive than the
same size aluminum hood, because of reduced
materials expense.
The pebble and hammer-tone surfaces offer
good light diffusion and more surface area to
reflect light. Hot spots are commonplace among
highly polished, mirror-like surfaces. Mirrorpolished hoods also scratch easily and create
uneven lighting.

Horizontal Reflective Hoods
Horizontal reflectors are most efficient for HID
systems, and are the best value for growers. A
horizontal lamp yields up to 40 percent more
light than a lamp burning in a vertical position.
Light is emitted from the arc tube. When hori¬
zontal, half of this light is directed downward
to the plants, so only half of the light needs to
be reflected. Horizontal reflectors are inherently
more efficient than vertical lamps/reflectors,
because half of the light is direct and only half
of the light must be reflected.
Horizontal reflective hoods are available in many
shapes and sizes. The closer the reflective hood
is to the arc tube, the iess distance light must
travel before being reflected. Less distance traveled
means more light reflected.

evenly over a large area and are perfect for vegetative
growth.
174

Horizontal reflective hoods tend to have a hot
spot directly under the bulb. To dissipate this hot
spot of light and lower the heat it creates, some
manufacturers install a light deflector below the
bulb. The deflector diffuses the light and heat
directly under the bulb. When there is no hot spot,
reflective hoods with deflectors can be placed
closer to plants.
Horizontally mounted HP sodium lamps use a smail
reflective hood for greenhouse culture. The hood is
mounted a few inches over the horizontal HP sodium
bulb. All light is reflected down toward plants, and the
small hood creates minimum shadow.

Vertical Reflective Hoods
Reflectors with vertical lamps are less efficient
than horizontal ones. Like horizontal bulbs, verti¬
cally mounted bulbs emit light from the sides of
the arc tube. This light must strike the side of the
hood before it is reflected downward to plants.
Reflected light is always less intense than original
light. Light travels farther before being reflected in
parabolic or cone reflective hoods. Direct light is
more intense and more efficient.
Parabolic dome reflectors offer the best value for
vertical reflectors. They reflect light relatively evenly,
though they throw less overall light than horizontal
reflectors. Large parabolic dome hoods distribute
light evenly and reflect enough light to sustain
vegetative growth. The light spreads out under the
hood and is reflected downward to plants. Popular
parabolic hoods are inexpensive to manufacture
and provide a good light value for the money. Fourfoot parabolic hoods are usually manufactured in
nine parts. The smaller size facilitates shipping and
handling. The customer assembles the hood with
small screws and nuts.
Four-foot cone hoods are usually manufactured
in four parts. The smaller size facilitates shipping
and handling. The customer assembles the pieces
with small screws and nuts. Cone-shaped reflec¬
tors using a vertical bulb waste light and are very
inefficient. Growers who try to save money by
purchasing cone-shaped reflectors pay even more
in lost efficiency.
For example, say you bought a cone reflec¬
tive hood for $20 instead of the top of the line

Chapter NINE
horizontal reflector for $40. First, let's look at
efficiency. The cone hood produces at 60 per¬
cent efficiency and the horizontal reflector at
100 percent, or 40 percent more. Each lamp
costs $36 per month to operate 12 hours daily
at $0.10 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). If 100 percent
= $0.10 per kilowatt-hour, then 60 percent
efficiency = $0.06, or a loss of $0.04 for each
kilowatt-hour. With this information we can
deduce that $36/$0.04 = 900 hours. In 900
hours (75 12-hour days) the horizontal reflector
has recouped the extra $20 cost. Not only does
the vertical cone yield 40 percent less light, it
costs 40 percent more to operate! When this
75-day break-even point is reached, you will
be stuck with an inefficient reflective hood that
costs more for fewer lumens every second the
lamp is using electricity!
Lightweight reflective hoods with open ends
dissipate heat quickly. Extra air flows directly
through the hood and around the bulb in openend fixtures to cool the bulb and the fixture.
Aluminum dissipates heat more quickly than
steel. Train a fan on reflective hoods to speed
heat loss.
Artificial light fades as it travels from its source
(the bulb). The closer you put the reflector to
the bulb, the more intense the light it reflects.
Enclosed hoods with a glass shield covering
the bulb operate at higher temperatures. The
glass shield is a barrier between plants and the
hot bulb. Enclosed hoods must have enough
vents; otherwise, heat build-up in the fixture
causes bulbs to burn out prematurely. Many of
these enclosed fixtures have a special vent fan
to evacuate hot air.

Air-Cooled Lamp Fixtures
Several air-cooled lights are available. Some
use a reflective hood with a protective glass
face and two squirrel cage blowers to move air
through the sealed reflective hood cavity. The
air is forced to travel around corners, which
requires a higher velocity of airflow. Other air¬
cooled reflectors have no airflow turns, so the
air is evacuated quickly and efficiently.

LIGHT, LAMPS & ELECTRICITY

Air-cooled fixtures use blowers to direct heat generated by
the bulb out ducting.

Water-Cooled Lamp Fixtures
Water-cooled and air-cooled lamp fixtures are
somewhat popular in hot climates. These lamps
run cooler and can be moved closer to plants.
Water-cooled bulbs are difficult for thermal
imaging equipment to detect. Air-cooled fixtures
are inexpensive to operate and easy to set up.
Keep outer jacket clean and avoid scratching.
Growers decrease bulb heat by 80 percent
with a properly set up water-cooled bulb. The
water and outer jacket account for a ten percent
lumen loss. Growers make up for the loss by
moving bulbs closer to plants. On an average
day, a 1000-watt bulb uses about 100 gallons of
water to keep cool, if the water runs to waste. To
recirculate the water requires a big, big reservoir.
The water in the reservoir that serves a recir¬
culating cooling system must also be cooled.
Reservoir coolers can easily cost $1000.

No Reflective Hood
One option is to remove the reflective hood. With
no hood, the lamp burns cooler and emits only
direct light.

Reflective Hood Study
I constructed a black room, everything black
inside, to measure the amount of light reflective
hoods yield. The room was 10 x 10-foot square
(3 m2). The floor was covered with black tar
paper. Less than three percent light could be
reflected from the black surfaces-there was no
extra light in this room. Measurements were

I tested five different lamps: a 1000-watt clear
super metal halide, a 1000-watt HP sodium, a
600-watt HP sodium, a 400-watt super metal
halide, and a 400-watt HP sodium. I positioned
the bulb exactly three feet from the floor. Every
lamp was warmed up for 15 minutes before
taking measurements.
The foot-candle readings on the floor were
taken every 12 inches (30 cm) and the results
posted to a spreadsheet program. I used a
simple spreadsheet graph program to present

Add a shallow shelf around the perimeter of the

Use brackets to put up a four to six-inch-wide shelf
around the perimeter of the garden. The shelf can

pots along the shelf. Rotate them so they develop

it's worth. If unfamiliar with electrical component
assembly and reading wiring diagrams, purchase
the assembled ballast in a package containing the

Do not buy used parts from a junkyard or try to
use a ballast if unsure of its capacity. Just because
a bulb fits a socket attached to a ballast, does not
mean that it is the proper system. One of the most
miserable gardens I have ever seen was grown with
mercury vapor streetlights and makeshift reflec¬

pilfered all the street lamps, ballast and all, in front
of his house.

The most common characteristics ballasts share are
noise and heat. This noise could drive some people
to great fits of paranoia! Ballasts operate at 90-150°F
(32-60°C). Touch a "strike anywhere" kitchen match
to the side to check if it is too hot. If the match lights,
the ballast is too hot and should be taken into the
shop for assessment. A ballast that runs too hot is
noisy and could cause problems or burn out. Heat
is the number one ballast destroyer. Many ballasts
are manufactured with a protective metal box.
Ballast designs are more simple now than ever before.
Above, you see two new European ballast designs.

This outer shell safely contains the core, capaci¬
tor (starter), and wiring. If you build another box
around a ballast to dampen noise, make sure there
is plenty of air circulation. If the ballast runs too hot,
it will be less efficient, burn out prematurely, and
maybe even start a fire!
More expensive ballasts are equipped with ven¬
tilation fans to maintain cool operating tempera¬
tures. Air vents allow a ballast to run cooler. The
vents should protect the internal parts and prevent

The ballast is attached to the bulb and reflective hood in

water from splashing in.
Some industrial ballasts are sealed in fiberglass or
similar material to make them weatherproof. These
ballasts are not recommended. They were designed
for outdoor use where heat buildup is not a prob¬
lem. Indoors, the protection of the sealed unit from
weather is unnecessary and creates excessive heat
and inefficient operation.
A handle will make the ballast easy to move.
A small 400-watt halide ballast weighs about 30
pounds (14 kg), and a large 1000-watt HP sodium
ballast tips the scales at about 55 pounds (25 kg).

Attach ballasts to the wall on a plank for easy inspection
and troubleshooting.

This small, heavy box is very awkward to move
without a handle.
Most ballasts sold by HID stores are "single tap"
and set up for 120-volt household current in North
America or 240-volts in Europe, Australia, and New
Zealand. North American ballasts run at 60 cycles
per minute, while European, Australian, and New
Zealand models run at 50 cycles per minute. A bal¬
last from Europe, Australia, or New Zealand will not
work properly at 60 cycles per minute. Some "multi¬

It is generally easiest to use the regular 120-volt
systems, because their outlets are more common.
The 240-volt systems are normally used in Europe,
Australia, and New Zealand or in North America
when several lamps are already taking up space
on other 120-volt circuits. Changing a "multi-tap"
ballast from 120 volts to 240 volts is a simple matter
of moving the wire from the 120-volt tap to the 240volt tap. "Single-tap" ballasts cannot change operat¬
ing voltages. Consult the wiring diagram found on
each transformer for specific instructions. There is
no difference in the electricity consumed by using
either 120 or 240-volt systems. The 120-volt system

draws about 9.6 amperes, and an HID on a 240-volt
current draws about 4.3 amperes. Both use the
same amount of electricity. Work out the details
yourself using the chart below.
The ballast has a lot of electricity flowing through
it. Do not touch the ballast when operating. Do not
place the ballast directly on a damp floor or any
floor that might get wet and conduct electricity.
Always place it up off the floor, and protect it from
possible moisture. The ballast should be suspended
in the air or on a shelf attached to the wall. It does
not have to be very high off the ground, just far
enough to keep it dry.
Place the ballast on a soft foam pad to absorb
vibrations and lower decibel sound output. Loose
components inside the ballast can be tightened
to further deaden noise caused by vibrations. Train
a fan on ballasts to cool them. Cooler ballasts are
more efficient, and bulbs burn brighter.
Ballasts can be attached to the light fixture remote.
The remote ballast offers the most versatility and is
the best choice for most indoor grow shows. A
remote ballast is easy to move. Help control heat
by placing it on or near the floor to radiate heat in
a cool portion of the grow room, or move the bal¬
last outside the garden to cool the room. Attached
ballasts are fixed to the hood; they require more
overhead space, are very heavy, and tend to create
more heat around the lamp.
Ballasts may be manufactured with an attached
timer.These units are very convenient, but the timer
should be constructed of heavy-duty heat-resistant

One way to determine when to replace a bulb is

Bulb Disposal
1. Place the bulb in a dry container, and then
place it in the trash.
2. Lamps contain materials that are harmful to
the skin. Avoid contact, and use protective
clothing.
3. Do not place the bulb in a fire.

Metal Halide Systems
The metal halide HID lamp is the most efficient
source of artificial white light available to grow¬
ers today. It comes in 175, 250, 400, 1000, 1100,
and 1500-watt sizes. They may be either clear or
phosphor coated, and all require a special bal¬

indoor growers. The 1500-watt halide is avoided
due to its relatively short 2000 to 3000 hour
life and incredible heat output. American grow¬
ers generally prefer the larger 1000-watt lamps,
and Europeans almost exclusively favor 400-watt
metal halide lamps.
The main metal halide manufacturers include
General Electric (Multivapor), Osram/Sylvania
(Metalarc) and Westinghouse (Metal Halide),
Iwasaki (Eye), Venture (SunMaster), and Philips
(Son Agro). Each manufacturer makes a super
halide which fits and operates in standard halide
ballasts and fixtures. Super metal halides produce
about 15 percent more lumens than standard
halides. Super halides cost a few dollars more
than standards but are well worth the money.
SunMaster, a division of Venture Lighting, has
developed new horticultural metal halide bulbs.

360, 400, 880, 940, and 1000-watt sizes. You do not
need an adaptor or any additional equipment. Simply
screw the bulb into a compatible ballast of compa¬
rable wattage. Conversion bulbs operate at a lower
wattage and are not as bright as HP sodium bulbs.
Although conversion bulbs have less blue, they are up
to 25 percent brighter than metal haiide systems and
their lumens-per-watt conversion is better than that
of super metal halides. The 940-watt conversion bulb
has a lumens-per-watt rating of 138. Similar to the HP
sodium lamp, the conversion bulb has a life expec¬
tancy of up to 24,000 hours. Unlike most high-pressure
sodium lamps which flicker on and off near the end of
their lives, conversion bulbs go off and remain off at

the end of their lives.
Although conversion bulbs are not inexpensive, they
are certainly less expensive than an entire HP sodium
system. For gardeners who own a metal halide sys¬
tem, or who deem metal halide the most appropriate
investment for their lighting needs, conversion bulbs
offer a welcome alternative for bright light. In the
United States, CEW Lighting distributes Iwasaki lights.

from high-pressure sodium to metal halide. Venture's
White-Lux and Iwasaki's White Ace are metal halide
lamps which will operate in an HP sodium system.
The 250, 400, 1000-watt conversion bulbs can be
used in compatible HPS systems with no alterations
or additional equipment. If you own a high-pressure
sodium system but need the added blue light which
metal halide bulbs produce, these conversion bulbs
will suit your needs.
Many gardeners have great success using conver¬
sion bulbs. If you have a metal halide system but want
the extra red and yellow light of an HP sodium lamp
to promote flowering, simply buy a conversion bulb.
Instead of investing in both a metal halide and an

HP sodium system, you can rely on a metal halide
system and use conversion bulbs when necessary,
or vice versa.

HP Sodium to Metal Halide
The Sunlux Super Ace and Ultra Ace (Iwasaki) and
Retrolux (Philips) produce an HP sodium spectrum
with a metal halide system. These bulbs make it
possible to use a metal halide ballast and get the
same spectrum as an HP sodium lamp. Lumensper-watt efficiency is traded for the convenience
of using these bulbs. A 1000-watt HP sodium bulb
produces 140,000 initial lumens. A MH to HPS
conversion bulb produces 130,000 initial lumens.
If you only want one lamp, a conversion bulb is a
fair choice.

known member of the HID family. The HID principle
was first used with the mercury vapor lamp around
the turn of the 20th century, but it was not until the
mid 1930s that the mercury vapor lamp was really
employed commercially.
Mercury vapor lamps produce only 60 lumensper-watt. A comparison of the spectral energy dis¬
tribution of the mercury vapor and the photosyn¬
thetic response chart will show this is a poor lamp
for horticulture. It is expensive to operate and
produces a spectrum with a low PAR value.
Lamps are available in sizes from 40 to 1000-watts.
Bulbs have fair lumen maintenance and a relatively
long life. Most wattages last up to three years at 18
hours of daily operation.
Bulbs usually require separate ballasts, however
there are a few low wattage bulbs with self-con¬
tained ballasts. Uninformed growers occasionally
try to scrounge mercury vapor ballasts from junk

Fluorescent Lamps
Fluorescent lamps have gone through major
changes in recent years. New bulbs produce more
light. Most growers use fluorescents to grow clones
and small vegetative plants and maintain mother
plants. Some growers even use them to flower
a crop. Fluorescents are available in many differ¬
ent spectrums, some almost identical to natural
sunlight.
Fluorescent lamps are long glass tubes that come
in a wide variety of lengths, from one to twelve
feet. The two- and four-foot tubes are the easiest
to handle and most readily available. Two four-foot
fluorescent bulbs in a shop light fixture cost from
$20 to $30.
Fluorescent lamps work very well for root cuttings.
They supply cool, diffused light in the proper color

spectrum to promote root growth. Use any "day¬
light spectrum" fluorescent lamp to root cuttings.
Fluorescents produce much less light than HIDs
and must be very close (two to four inches) to the
plants for best results.
Using fluorescents along with HIDs is awkward
and problematic. When using them in conjunction
with HIDs, fluorescents must be very close to plants
to provide enough intense light to do any good.
Fixtures may also shade plants from HID light and
generally get in the way.
Plants will flower under fluorescent lights. The

Black light fluorescent lamps emit ultraviolet (UV)

not used to grow cannabis. Ultraviolet light is sup¬

to help sell overpriced lights. Now the market

remove it and buy a new one to replace it. Be very
careful if the ballast has brown slime or sludge on
or around it. This sludge could contain carcinogenic
PCBs. If the ballast contains the sludge, dispose of it
in an approved location. Most modern fluorescents
are self-starting, but older fluorescents require a
special starter. This starter may be integrated into

eter and come in the sizes T12 (1.5 inch [5 cm]),

old-fashioned magnetic ballasts. The T8 and theT5
(technically CFLs) use electronic ballasts. Growers
prefer slimmer T8 and T5 bulbs with electronic
ballasts because they run cooler, electricity cycles
faster, and lights do not flicker.
The average lumen output of a 40-watt T12 is
2800 lumens, about 68 lumens per watt.

not as bright as HIDs they are available in Cool White

Compact fluorescent lamps are perfect for growers
with a limited budget and a small space. They run
cooler than HIDs and require minimal ventilation.

Fluorescent lamps are great for rooting cuttings. Some
people even use them to grow cannabis. Buds that flower

When CFLs were first introduced, wattages were
too small, and bulbs did not emit enough light to
grow cannabis. New large-wattage CFLs are much
brighter than smaller, low-wattage CFLs. Several

Compact fluorescent lamps used to grow can¬
nabis are available in two basic styles and shapes.
Modular CFLs have independent bulbs and ballasts
that can be replaced separately. The bulb is shaped
like a long "U" with a two- or four-pin fixture (these
lamps are designated "1U"). The 20-inch (50 cm)
long "1U" 55-watt, dual-pin base bulbs are common
in Europe. Normally, two 55-watt lamps are placed
in a reflective hood. Shorter U-shaped bulbs are
common in North America, the United Kingdom,
Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.

Light spectrum of Daylight (6400 K) fluorescent bulb

The second type consists of miniaturized fluores¬
cent tubes packaged with an attached (electronic)
ballast. The short lamps consist of several U-shaped
tubes (designated 4U, 5U, 6U, etc., for the number of
U-shaped tubes) that measure from eight to twelve
inches (20-30 cm) not including the two- to fourinch (5-10 cm) attached ballast and threaded base.
Smaller wattages fit into household incandescent
light bulb sockets. Larger 95,125,150, and 200-watt
bulbs require a larger mogul socket. Common watt¬
ages used for growing cannabis include 55, 60, 65,
85,95,120,125,150, and 200.

iightsite.net is an outstanding site that also has a
retail store locator. Philips is producing some of the
higher wattage lamps. Their PL-H bulb is a 4U bulb
available in 60, 85, and 120 wattages with Kelvin
ratings from 3000 to 4100.
Beware of manufacturer and reseller web sites
making outrageous claims about CFL performance.
The most common exaggerated claim is found at
the Lights of America site about the 65-watt Florex
security light. The package claims the lamp produc¬
es 6825 lumens, but an asterisk directs you to the
bottom of the box and explains these are "bright¬
ness lumens" not "photometric lumens." A look at

their website www.lightsofamerica.com claims the
65 watt Florex produces 4550 lumens. We tested
them and we can agree with 4500 lumens.
Furthermore, manufacturers commonly compare
the output of CFLs with incandescent lamps. But the
comparison is misleading. They claim the 65 watt
CFL is equivalent to a 500 watt incandescent. A 65
watt CFL produces the same number of lumens as a
500 watt incandescent bulb. Given this information
many people assume that a 65 watt lamp produces
as much light as all 500 watt bulbs. Not true.
Cool White CFLs have a kelvin (K) temperature of
199

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER S BIBLE
4100, with more blue in the spectrum, which lessens internodal branching
space in plants. Cool White CFLs are perfect to grow short, stout seedling
and vegetative plants. Warm White CFLs (2700 K) have more red in the
spectrum and can be used alone but are best used in conjunction with Cool
White lamps to avoid internodal stretching during flowering. A 95- to 120watt lamp will illuminate a space of about two square feet (60 cm2).
Light from CFLs fades fast and must be placed close to the plants.The bulb
produces very little heat and can be mounted about two inches (5 cm) away
from foliage to achieve the best results.
Short U-shaped bulbs are most efficient when vertically oriented. When
mounted horizontally under a reflective hood, much light is reflected back
and forth between the bulb's outer envelope and the hood, which mark¬
edly lowers efficiency. Heat also builds up from the ballast. Both conditions
lessen efficiency.
Save electricity in the grow house and replace incandescent bulbs with
compact fluorescents. Compact fluorescents use about 75 percent less
energy than incandescent lamps, and emit 90 percent less heat for the same
amount of light. If you replace ten 100-watt incandescent bulbs, you will
save 750 watts of electricity!

Construction and Operation
Compact fluorescent lamps create light by passing electricity through gas¬
eous vapor under low pressure. Compact fluorescent bulbs are coated inside
with tri-phosphor which further expands light emission. CFLs must warm up
about five minutes so the chemicals become stable before they come to full
brightness. Like all fluorescents, CFLs require an appropriate fixture contain¬
ing a small electronic ballast to regulate electricity and household electrical
current. Ballasts are either attached to the lamp (self-ballasted) or integrated
into the reflective hood. Smaller self-ballasted lamps screw into a household
incandescent bulb socket. Larger bulbs screw into a mogul socket. Each 1-U
bulb is hooked to sockets with bi-pin connectors.
Compact fluorescent lamps will normally last 10-20,000 hours (18-36
months at 18 hours daily use). The life of a CF ballast is from 50,000 to 60,000
hours (seven to nine years at 18 hours daily use). Lamps with attached bal¬
last burn out three to six times faster than the ballast. When the lamp's life is
over, the lamp and the attached ballast are both thrown away, which means
you are throwing away a perfectly good ballast! My preference is to use the
long CFLs that are not attached to a ballast.
Compact fluorescent lamps can also be used to supplement the reddishyellow spectrum from HP sodium lamps. However, the outer case covering
the attached ballast is susceptible to deterioration from UV light. When used
in conjunction with other HID lamps that produce UV rays, the ballast case
deteriorates more quickly. Attached ballasts are not designed for humid

grow room applications. Couple this weakness to humidity with a bit of UV
light, and bulbs burn out more quickly.
The end of ballast life is signaled when it stops. When the ballast burns out,
remove and replace it.

efficient but have a limited spectrum.

Incandescent Lamps
Incandescent lamps were invented by Thomas
Edison. Light is produced by sending electricity
through the filament, a super fine wire inside the
bulb. The filament resists the flow of electricity, heat¬
ing it to incandescence, causing it to glow and
emit light. The incandescent bulbs work on ordinary
home current and require no ballast. They come in a
wide range of wattages and constructions.
Most incandescent lamps have a spectrum in the
far-red end, but there are some incandescent grow
lamps that have an enhanced blue spectrum. They
are expensive to operate and produce few lumensper-watt. They are most efficiently used as a source
of rooting medium heat for clones rooting under

LP Sodium Lamps
Low Pressure (LP) sodium lamps are monochro¬
matic. Do not use these lamps to grow cannabis.
They produce light in a very narrow portion of the
spectrum, at 589 nanometers, and emit a yellow
glow. They are available in wattages from 55 to 180.
Their lumens-per-watt conversion is the highest of
all lamps on the market today. Their main use in
industry has been for security or warehouse light.
Lamps require specific ballasts and fixtures accord¬
ing to wattage. The fixture for a 180-watt lamp is
just a little larger than a fixture for two 40-watt,
four-foot (120 cm) fluorescent tubes.
After visiting hundreds and hundreds of grow
rooms over the last 20 years, I have seen only one
LP sodium lamp in use.

cool fluorescents.

Tungsten Halogen Lamps
The tungsten halogen lamp is a poor grow light. It
was originally called Iodine Quartz lamp. The outer
tube is made of heat-resistant quartz. The main gas
inside the quartz tube was iodine, one of the five
halogens. Today, Bromine is used most often in the
lamps. Similar to incandescent lamps, they use a
tungsten wire filament and a sealed bulb and are
very expensive to operate. Their lumens-per-watt
output is very low. They run on a household current
and require no ballast. Tungsten bulbs are as inef¬
ficient to operate as are the incandescent lamps.
Their color spectrum is in the far-red end with 10-15
percent in the visible spectrum.

Electricity & Safety
You don't need to understand the basics of elec¬
tricity to grow indoors or in a greenhouse, but
understanding the basics will save you money, time,
and possibly the shock of your life.
Before you touch anything electrical, please
remember to work backwards when installing elec¬
trical components or doing wiring. Start at the bulb,
and work towards the plug-in. Always plug in the
cord last!

There are many ways to deal with the increase in
consumption of electricity. One friend moved into
a home that had all electric heat and a fireplace. He
installed three HID lamps in the basement that also
generated heat. The excess heat was dispersed via
a vent fan attached to a thermostat/humidistat. He
turned off the electric heat, bought a fireplace insert,

and started heating with wood. Even running three
lamps, consuming three kilowatts per hour, the elec¬
tric bill was less than it had been with electric heat!
Electric bills are controlled with and generated by a
computer system. Monthly energy consumption is
often displayed on a bar graph for the previous 12
months. This graph makes it easy to see fluctuations
in electricity consumption.
A one- to three-bedroom home can run two to
three 1000-watt lamps, and a four- to five-bedroom
home can operate three to five lamps with little
or no suspicion regarding electrical consumption.
Powering any more lamps usually requires adding
new incoming circuits, or the use of present circuits
will be severely limited.
A ground fault interrupt (GFI) outlet contains a breaker
switch and will turn off electricity when tripped.

The amount of electricity consumption and the
size of the home are proportional. Often, an increase
in electric consumption is normal. For example, elec¬
tric bills always increase if there is a baby in the home
or if there are more residents living there. Changing
to gas or wood heat and a gas stove and water
heater will also lower the electricity bill. Some friends
bought a new, efficient water heater and saved $17
per month! Just by changing water heaters, they
were able to add another 600-watt lamp. Another
grower set her water heater for 130°F (54°C) instead

of 170°F (77°C). This simple procedure saved about
25 kWh per month. But do not turn the water heater
any lower than 130°F. Harmful bacteria can grow
below this safe point.
The electric company might call to ask if you were
aware of your increased electricity bill. This is nothing
to worry about. Simply reply that you are aware of
the electricity being used. If you like to make excuses,
some appliances that draw a lot of electricity are:
electric pottery kiln, arc welder, and hot tub. If the
situation warrants, take showers at a friend's house
or at a gym, use a Laundromat, and never use any
electrical appliances.

Setting up the HID System Step-by-Step
Step One: Before setting up the HID system, read
"Setting Up the Grow Room" in Chapter Six, and
complete the step-by-step instructions.
Step Two: Both the lamp and ballast radiate quite
a bit of heat. Take care when positioning them, so
they are not so close to plants or flammable walls
and ceiling that they become hazardous. If the
room has limited space with a low ceiling, place
a protective, non-flammable material like metal
between the lamp and ceiling to protect from heat.
An exhaust fan will be necessary to keep things cool.
It is most effective to place the remote ballast near
the ceiling to keep things cool. Place it outside the
grow room if the room is too hot. When hanging the
lamp on the overhead chain or pulley system, make
sure electrical cords are unencumbered and not too
close to any heat source.
Step Three: Buy and use a good timer to keep the
photoperiod consistent. A decent timer costs from
$20 to $30 and is worth its weight in buds!
Step Four: To plug in the HID lamp, it will be
necessary to find the proper outlet. A 1000-watt HID
lamp will use about 9.5 amperes (amps) of electricity
on a regular 120-volt house current.
A typical home has a fuse box or a breaker box.
Each fuse or breaker switch controls an electrical
circuit in the home. The fuse or breaker switch will
be rated for 15,20,25, 30, or 40-amp service. Circuits
are considered overloaded when more than 80
percent of the amps are being used. (See: "Overload
Chart" on page 212). The fuse will have its amp rat¬

there to cover any power surges. If the circuit is
rated for 20 or more amps, it may be used for the
1000-watt HID and a few other low-amp appliances.
To find out how many amps are drawn by each
appliance, add up the number of total watts they
use, and divide by 120.
Never put a larger fuse in the fuse box than it is
rated for. The fuse is the weakest link in the circuit.
If a 20-amp fuse is placed into a 15-amp circuit, the
fuse is able to conduct more electricity than the wir¬
ing. This causes wires to burn rather than the fuse.
An overloaded circuit may result in a house fire.
Use an extension cord that is at least 14-gauge
wire or heavier if the plug will not reach the outlet
desired. Thick 14-gauge extension cord is more
difficult to find and may have to be constructed.
Smaller 16- or 18-gauge cord will not conduct
adequate electricity and will heat up, straining the
entire system. Cut the 14-gauge extension cord to
the exact length. The further electricity travels, the
weaker it gets and the more heat it produces, which
also strains the system.
Step Five: Always use a three-prong grounded
plug. If your home is not equipped with work¬
ing three-prong grounded outlets, buy a threeprong grounded plug and outlet adapter. Attach
the ground wire to a grounded ferrous metal object
like a grounded metal pipe or heavy copper wire
driven into the earth to form a ground, and screw
the ground into the plug-in face. You will be work¬
ing with water under and around the HID system.
Water conducts electricity about as well as the
human body.
Step Six: Once the proper circuit is selected, the

socket and hood are mounted over¬
head, and the ballast is in place (but not
plugged in), screw the HID bulb fingertight into the socket. Make sure the
bulb is secured in the socket tightly, but
not too tight, and make certain there is
a good connection. When secure, wipe
off all smudges on the bulb to increase
brightness.
Step Seven: Plug the three-prong
plug into the timer that is in the OFF
position. Plug the timer into the
grounded outlet, set the timer at the
desired photoperiod, and turn the
timer on. Shazam! The ballast will hum;
the lamp will flicker and slowly warm
up, reaching full brilliance in about five
minutes.
A bulb hanging crookedly under a reflective hood causes light to
be reflected unevenly, which creates "hot spots”and "cold spots"
of light in the garden.

Introduction
Soil is made up of many mineral particles
mixed together with living and dead organic
\

matter that incorporates air and water. Three
basic factors contribute to the cannabis
root's ability to grow in a soil: texture, pH,
and nutrient content.
Soil texture is governed by the size and
physical makeup of the mineral particles.
Proper soil texture is required for adequate
root penetration, water, and oxygen reten¬
tion and drainage as well as many other
complex chemical processes.

Indoor soils that do not fulfill these require¬
ments should be thrown out or amended.

This pH Chart shows the Safe Zone for soil
gardens is between 5.8 and 6.8.

See "Soil Amendments."

pH
The pH scale, from one to 14, measures acidto-alkaline balance. One is the most acidic,
seven is neutral, and 14 most alkaline. Every full
point change in pH signifies a ten-fold increase
or decrease in acidity or alkalinity. For example,
soil or water with a pH of five is ten times more
acidic than water or soil with a pH of six Water
with a pH of five is one hundred times more
acidic than water with a pH of seven. With a ten¬
fold difference between each point on the scale,
accurate measurement and control is essential
to a strong, healthy garden.
Cannabis grows best in soil with a pH from 6.5
to 7.0. Within this range marijuana can properly
absorb and process available nutrients most
efficiently. If the pH is too low (acidic), acid
salts chemically bind nutrients, and the roots
are unable to absorb them. An alkaline soil with
a high pH causes nutrients to become unavail¬
able. Toxic salt buildup that limits water intake

An inexpensive electronic pH tester is easy to use.

by roots also becomes a problem. Hydroponic
solutions perform best in a pH range a little
lower than for soil. The ideal pH range for hydro¬
ponics is from 5.8 to 6.8. Some growers run the
pH at lower levels and report no problems with
nutrient uptake. The pH of organic soil mixes is
very important because it dictates the ability of
specific pH-sensitive bacteria.
Measure the pH with a soil test kit, litmus
paper, or electronic pH tester, all of which are
available at most nurseries. When testing pH,
take two or three samples and follow instruc¬
tions supplied by the manufacturer "to the let¬
ter." Soil test kits measure soil pH and primary
nutrient content by mixing soil with a chemical
solution and comparing the color of the solution
to a chart. Every one of these kits I have seen or
used is difficult for novice gardeners to achieve
accurate measurements. Comparing the color of
the soil/chemical mix to the color of the chart is
often confusing. If you use one of these kits, make
sure to buy one with good, easy-to-understand
instructions and ask the sales clerk for exact rec¬
ommendations on using it.

When planting, add one cup of fine dolomite lime
to each cubic foot (one ounce per gallon [30 ml
per 4 L]) of planting medium to stabilize the pH
and provide calcium and magnesium.

For an accurate pH test with
an electronic pH meter:
• Clean the probes of the meter after each
test and wipe away any corrosion.
• Pack the soil around the probes.
• Water soil with distilled or neutral pH water
before testing.

If using litmus paper, collect samples that
demonstrate an average of the soil. Place the
samples in a clean jar, and moisten the soil
samples with distilled water. Place two pieces
of the litmus paper in the muddy water. After
ten seconds, remove one of the strips of litmus
paper. Wait a minute before removing the other
one. Both pieces of litmus paper should regis¬
ter the same color. The litmus paper container
should have a pH-color chart on the side. Match
the color of the litmus paper with the colors on
the chart to get a pH reading. Litmus paper will
accurately measure the acidity of the substance
to within a point. The pH readings will not be
accurate if altered by water with a high or low
pH, and the litmus paper could give a false
reading if the fertilizer contains a color-tracing
agent.
Electronic pH testers are economical and con¬
venient. Less expensive pH meters are accurate
enough for casual use. More expensive models
are quite accurate. Pay special attention to
the soil moisture when taking a pH test with
an electronic meter. The meters measure the
electrical current between two probes and are
designed to work in moist soil. If the soil is dry,
the probes do not give an accurate reading. I
prefer electronic pH meters over the reagent
test kits and litmus paper because they are
convenient, economical, and accurate. Once
purchased, you can measure pH thousands
of times with an electronic meter, while the
chemical test kits are good for about a dozen
tests. Perpetual pH-metering devices are also
available and most often used to monitor hydro¬
ponic nutrient solutions.
Check the pH of irrigation water. In dry climates,
such as the desert Southwest United States,

Spain, Australia, etc., irrigation water is often
alkaline with a pH above 6.0. The water in rainy
climates, such as the Pacific Northwest of North
America, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and
maritime Northern Europe, is often acidic with a
pH below 6.0. The pH and electrical conductiv¬
ity (EC) of water supplies in municipalities and
cities can also change throughout the year in
some countries. After repeated watering, water
with a pH that is too high or low will change the
pH of the growing medium, especially in organi¬
cally amended soils. Raw-water pH above 6.0
helps keep fertilizer mixes from becoming too
acidic. Climatic conditions can also affect irriga¬
tion water pH. For example, the pH can become
more acidic in late autumn, when leaves fall
and decompose. Large municipalities carefully
monitor and correct the pH, and there are few
water-quality problems. Check the pH at least
once a week.
Cannabis will grow in almost any soil*, but it
flourishes when the pH is between 6.5 and 7.
Commercial potting soil almost never has a pH
above 7.5. A lower pH is more common, even
as low as 5.5. Some potting soils purchased at
a nursery are pH balanced and near a neutral
7. However, most potting soils have a tendency
to be acidic. The easiest way to stabilize soil pH
is to mix in one cup of fine dolomite lime per
cubic foot (10 liters) of potting soil. Mix dolo¬
mite lime thoroughly into dry soil. Remix the soil
in the container after it has been watered.
Fine Dolomite Lime has long been a favorite
pH stabilizer for gardeners. It is difficult to apply
too much as long as it is thoroughly mixed into
soil. Dolomite has a neutral pH of 7, and it can
never raise the pH beyond 7.0. It stabilizes the
pH safely. Compensate for acidic soil by mixing
dolomite with soil before planting. It will help

could take a year or more
before it becomes available
for uptake by roots. Mix
dolomite flour thoroughly
with the growing medium
before planting. Improperly
mixed, dolomite will strat¬
ify, forming a cake or layer
that burns roots and repels
water.
Hydrated Lime contains
only calcium and no magne¬
sium. As the name hydrated
implies, it is water-soluble.
Fast-acting hydrated lime
alters the pH quickly. Mix
it thoroughly with warm
water and apply with each
watering for fast results.
Many growers use a mix
of 0.25 cup (6 cl) hydrated
lime and 0.75 cup (18 cl)
dolomite lime. Hydrated
lime is immediately avail¬
able, whereas the slower
acting dolomite buffers the
pH over the long term. Do

not use more than 0.5 cup (12 cl) of hydrated lime per cubic foot (30
L) of soil. The larger quantity is released so fast that it can toxify soil,
and stunt or even kill plants. The beauty of hydrated lime is that it
washes out of the soil in about two weeks. Leach it quicker by flush¬
ing pots with copious quantities of water. Hydrated lime is also used
as a grow room fungicide. Sprinkle it on the floor and around the
room. It kills fungus on contact.
Do not use quicklime; it is toxic to plants. Calcic lime (quicklime)
contains only calcium and is not a good choice. It does not have the
buffering qualities of dolomite nor does it contain any magnesium.
Raise the pH of a growing medium or irrigation water by adding
some form of alkali, such as calcium carbonate, potassium hydroxide,
or sodium hydroxide. Both hydroxides are caustic and require special
care when handling. These compounds are normally used to raise the
pH of hydroponic nutrient solutions but can be used to treat acidic
nutrient solutions when applied to soil. The easiest and most conve¬
nient way to raise and stabilize soil pH is to add fine dolomite lime
and hydrated lime before planting. To raise the pH one point add 3
cups (65 cl) of fine dolomite lime to one cubic foot (30 L) of soil. An
alternate fast- acting mix would be to add 2.5 cups (590 cl) of dolo¬
mite and 0.5 cup (12 cl) of hydrated lime to one cubic foot of soil.
Pulverized eggshells, clam or oyster shells, and wood ashes have a
high pH and help raise soil pH. Eggshells and oyster shells take a long
time to decompose enough to affect the pH; wood ashes have a pH
from 9.0-11.0 and and are easy to overapply. Ashes are often collect¬
ed from fireplaces or wood stoves that have been burning all kinds
of trash and are, therefore, unsafe. Do not use wood ashes on indoor

Aspirin also lowers the pH.
However, hormonal reac¬
tions appear to be triggered
by aspirin. Some growers
have reported more her¬
maphrodites when using
aspirin to alter the pH.

gardens unless you know their origin, pH, and
nutrient content. You can add cottonseed meal,
lemon peels, coffee grounds, or a high-acidity
fertilizer to lower pH in soil to below 7.0.
Commercial potting soils and soilless mixes
are often acidic and the pH seldom needs to be
lowered. If new soil pH is under 6 or above 8,
it is easier and less expensive in the long run to
change soil rather than experiment with chang¬
ing the pH. Fertilizers are naturally acidic and
lower the pH of the growing medium. Sulfur
will lower the pH, if necessary, but it is tricky
to use. I advise using an acid to alter the pH.
Add distilled white vinegar at the rate of one
teaspoon per gallon (1.2 ml per L) of irrigation
water, allow the water to sit for a few minutes,
and then recheck it. The pH should drop by a full
point. If it does not, add more vinegar in small
increments. Often when using vinegar, the pH
drifts up overnight. Check the pH the next day.
Hydroponic growers use phosphoric and nitric
acid to lower pH. Calcium nitrate can also be
used, but is less common. Keep a close eye on
the pH and control it accordingly. After altering
the pH, check it, and then check it again daily to
make sure it remains stable.

Soil temperature

between 65~70°F
(18-24X) for
best results.

Humic and fulvic acids
chelate metallic ions mak¬
ing them readily transport¬
able by water. This ability
is dependent upon the pH
level. Copper, iron, manga¬
nese, and zinc are difficult
to dissolve. When mixed
in a chelated form, they
become readily available
for absorption.

Soil Temperature
Raising the soil temperature speeds the chem¬
ical process and can hasten nutrient uptake.
Ideally, the soil temperature should range from
65-70°F (18-24°C) for the most chemical activ¬
ity. Warm the soil with soil-heating cables or a
heating pad. Fasten heating cables to a board or
table and set a heat-conducting pad on top of
the cables to distribute heat evenly. Set cuttings
and seedlings in shallow flats or growing trays
on top of the heat-conducting pad. The added
heat speeds root growth when soil temperature
is below 65°F (18°C).
Soil heating cables cost much less than soil
heating pads but must be installed, whereas
the pads are ready to use. Most commercial
nurseries carry cables, and hydroponic stores
carry heating pads. When rooting clones, a heat¬
ing pad or cables virtually ensure success and
expedite root growth.
Cold soil slows water and nutrient uptake and
stifles growth. Growers often overwater when
the soil is too cold or the room cools unexpect¬
edly, which further slows growth. Pots on cold

concrete floors stay as cold as the concrete,
which is always colder than the ambient tem¬
perature. Increase soil temperature by moving
pots up off the floor a few inches. Set them on
an insulating board or piece of Styrofoam™.
Soil temperatures that climb above 75°F (39°
C) dehydrate roots, and at higher temperatures
the roots actually cook! It is relatively easy to
heat the soil in a pot. If the light or any heat
source is too close to small pots, it can eas¬
ily heat up the outside layer of soil where the
majority of the feeder roots are located. Once
destroyed, roots take one or two weeks to grow
back. Two weeks accounts for one quarter of the
flowering cycle!
The more feeder root hairs there are to absorb
water and nutrients, the faster and stronger
plants will grow. Once roots go beyond their
comfort zone, they send stress signals to foli¬
age and stomata via hormones to close and
conserve moisture.
Oxygen is essential for clones that are growing
roots. Water holds under one percent dissolved
oxygen at 70°F (21°C). Bump the temperature
up to 85°F (29°C) and it holds less than 0.5
percent oxygen.
Root temperatures below 40°F (4°C) make
water expand, which causes cell damage.

Temperatures above 92°F (33°C) cause exces¬
sive vapor pressure within the roots, which can
cause damage. At high temperatures roots send
stress signals to shut the leaves down before
damage can occur.

Potting Soil
Potting soil fresh out of the bag often fulfills all
requirements for a growing medium: good texture
that allows good root penetration, water retention,
and good drainage, a stable pH between 6 and 7,
and a minimum supply of nutrients.
Premium fast-draining soils with good texture
that will not break down quickly are the best
choice. Potting soils found at nurseries are often
formulated with a wetting agent and retain
water and air evenly, drain well, and allow easy
root penetration. Organic potting soils are very
popular. These soils are often fortified with
organic nutrients including readily available
high-nitrogen worm castings. Potting soils are
very heavy, and transportation costs tend to
keep them somewhat localized. There are many
good brands of high-quality potting soil. Ask
your nursery person for help in selecting one for
fast-growing vegetables.
Stay away from discount brands of low-quality
potting soil. These soils can be full of weed seed

and diseases, hold water unevenly, and drain
poorly. Ultimately, saving a few pennies on soil
will cost many headaches and a low yield later.
Many potting soils supply seedling transplants
and clones with enough food (fertilizer) for the
first two to four weeks of growth. After that,
supplemental fertilization is necessary to retain
rapid, robust growth. Add fine-grade dolomite
lime to buffer and stabilize the pH. Trace ele¬
ments in fortified soil and soilless mixes can
leach out and should be replenished with che¬
lated nutrients, if deficiency signs occur. Organic
growers often add their own blends of trace ele¬
ments in mixes that contain seaweed, guanos,
and manures.
Although some growers reuse their potting
soil, I do not recommend it. If used for more
than one crop, undesirable microorganisms,
insects and fungi start growing; nutrients are
depleted; water and air retention are poor,
causing compaction and poor drainage. Some
growers mix their old potting soil with new pot¬
ting soil to stretch their mix. Cutting corners this
way most often costs more in production than
is saved in soil.
Potting soil or soilless mix that contains more
than 30 percent lightweight pumice or perlite
may float and stratify when saturated with water
before planting. Mix water-saturated soil thor¬
oughly with your hands until it is evenly mixed
before planting or transplanting, if necessary.

Mushroom Compost
Mushroom compost is an inexpensive potting
soil and soil amendment that is packed with
organic goodies. Mushroom compost is steril¬
ized chemically to provide a clean medium for
mushroom growth. After serving its purpose as
a mushroom growing medium, it is discarded.
Laws usually require that it sit fallow for two
years or more to allow all the harmful sterilants
to leach out. After lying fallow for several years,
mushroom compost is very fertile and packed
with beneficial microorganisms. The high-power
compost could also foster antifungal and anti¬
bacterial properties in foliage and below the

soil line, which helps guard against disease.
Mushroom compost is loaded with beneficial
bacteria that hasten nutrient uptake. The tex¬
ture, water holding ability, and drainage in
some mushroom compost should be amended
with perlite to promote better drainage. Check
your local nursery or extension service for a
good source of mushroom compost. Some of
the most abundant harvests I have seen were
grown in mushroom compost.

Soilless Mix
Soilless mixes are very popular, inexpensive,
lightweight, and sterile growing mediums.
Commercial greenhouse growers have been
using them for decades. The mixes contain
some or all of the following: pumice, vermiculite, perlite, sand, peat moss, and coconut coir.
Premixed commercial soilless mixes are favor¬
ites of countless growers. These mixes retain
moisture and air while allowing strong root
penetration and even growth. The fertilizer con¬
centration, moisture level, and pH are very easy
to control with precision in soilless mix.
Soilless mixes are the preferred substrate for
many bedding plant and vegetable seedling
commercial growers. Soilless mixes have good
texture, hold water, and drain well. Unless
fortified with nutrient, soilless mixes contain no
nutrients and are pH balanced near 6.0 to 7.0.
Coarse soilless mixes drain well and are easy
to push plants into growing faster with heavy
fertilization. The fast-draining mixes can be
leached efficiently so nutrients have little chance
of building up to toxic levels. Look for readymixed bags of fortified soilless mixes such as
Jiffy Mix®, Ortho Mix®, Sunshine Mix®, TerraLite®, and ProMix®, etc. To improve drainage,
mix 10-30 percent coarse perlite before plant¬
ing. Fortified elements supply nutrients up to a
month, but follow directions on the package.
Soilless components can be purchased sepa¬
rately and mixed to the desired consistency.
Ingredients always blend together best when
mixed dry and wetted afterwards using a wet¬
ting agent to make water more adhesive. Mix

small amounts right in the bag. Larger batches
should be mixed in a wheelbarrow, concrete
slab, or in a cement mixer. Blending your own
soil or soilless mix is a dusty, messy job that
takes little space. To cut down on dust, lightly
mist the pile with water several times when
mixing. Always wear a respirator to avoid inhal¬
ing dust.
The texture of soilless mixes-for rapid-growing
cannabis-should be coarse, light, and spongy.
Such texture allows drainage with sufficient
moisture and air retention, as well as providing
good root penetration qualities. Fine soilless
mix holds more moisture and works best in
smaller containers. Soilless mixes that contain
more perlite and sand drain faster, making
them easier to fertilize heavily without excessive
fertilizer-salt buildup. Vermiculite and peat hold
water longer and are best used in small pots
that require more water retention.
The pH is generally near neutral, 7.0. If using
more than 15 percent peat, which is acidic,
add appropriate dolomite or hydrated lime to
correct and stabilize the pH. Check the pH regu¬
larly every week. Soilless mixes are composed
mainly of mineral particles that are not affected
by organic decomposition, which could change
the pH. The pH is affected by acidic fertilizers
or by water with a high or low pH. Check the
pH of the runoff water to ensure the pH in the
medium is not too acidic.

Propagation Cubes & Mixes
Rockwool root cubes, peat pellets, and Oasis®
blocks are pre-formed containers that make
rooting cuttings, starting seedlings, and trans¬
planting them easy. Root cubes and peat pots
also help encourage strong root systems. Peat
pots are small, compressed peat moss contain¬
ers with an outer wall of expandable plastic
netting. The flat pellets pop up into a seedling
pot when watered.
Place a seed or cutting in a moist peat pot or
root cube. If the little container does not have a
planting hole, make one with a chopstick, large
nail, or something similar. Set the seed or clone
stem in the hole. Crimp the top over the seed

or around the stem so it makes constant contact
with the medium. In one to three weeks, roots
grow and show through the side of the cube.
Cut the nylon mesh from peat pots before it
gets entangled with roots. To transplant, set the
peat pot or root cube in a pre-drilled hole in a
rockwool block or into larger pot. Clones and
seedlings suffer little or no transplant shock
when transplanted properly.
Check moisture levels in peat pots and root
cubes daily. Keep them evenly moist but not
drenched. Root cubes and peat pots do not
contain any nutrients. Seedlings do not require
nutrients for the first week or two. Feed seed¬
lings after the first week and clones as soon as
they are rooted.
Coarse sharp sand, fine vermiculite, and perlite
work well to root cuttings. Sand and perlite are
fast draining, which helps prevent damping-off.
Vermiculite holds water longer and makes clon¬
ing easier. A good mix is one third of each: sand,
fine perlite, and fine vermiculite. Premixed seed
starter mixes sold under such brand names as
Sunshine Mix and Terra-Lite are the easiest and
most economical mediums in which to root
clones and start seedlings. Soilless mix also
allows for complete control of critical nutrient
and root stimulating hormone additives, which
are essential to asexual propagation.

Soil Amendments
Rockwool plugs grow strong root systems in about
two weeks.

Coarse perlite is lightweight.

Soil amendments increase the soil's air, water-, and nutrient-retaining abilities. Soil
amendments fall into two categories: mineral
and organic.
Mineral amendments are near neutral on the
pH scale and contain few, if any, available nutri¬
ents. Mineral amendments decompose through
weathering and erosion. Add mineral amend¬
ments to augment air and increase drainage.
They have the advantage of creating no bacterial
activity to alter nutrient content and pH of the
growing medium. Dry mineral amendments are
also very lightweight and much easier to move
in and out of awkward spaces.

SOIL & CONTAINERS
Perlite is sand or volcanic glass expanded by
heat. It holds water and nutrients on its many
irregular surfaces, and it works especially well
for aerating the soil. This is a good medium to
increase drainage during vegetative and flow¬
ering growth, and it does not promote fertil¬
izer-salt build-up. Versatile perlite is available in
three main grades: fine, medium and coarse.
Most growers prefer the coarse grade as a soil
amendment. Perlite should make up one third
or less of any mix to keep it from floating and
stratifying the mix.
Pumice, volcanic rock, is very light and holds
water, nutrients, and air, in its many catacomb¬
like holes. It is a good amendment for aerating
the soil and retaining moisture evenly. But like
perlite, pumice floats and should constitute less
than a third of any mix to avoid problems.
Hydroclay is used more and more as a soil
amendment in containers. The large expanded
clay pellets expedite drainage and hold air with¬
in the growing medium. See Chapter Twelve
"Hydroponic Gardening" for more information.
Vermicuiite is mica processed and expanded
by heat. It holds water, nutrients, and air within
its fiber and gives body to fast-draining soils.
Fine vermicuiite holds too much water for
cuttings, but does well when mixed with a
fast-draining medium. This amendment holds
more water than perlite or pumice. Used in
hydroponic wick systems, vermicuiite holds and
wicks much moisture. Vermicuiite comes in
three grades: fine, medium, and coarse. Use fine
vermicuiite as an ingredient in cloning mixes. If
fine is not available, crush coarse or medium
vermicuiite between your hands, rubbing palms
back and forth. Coarse is the best choice as a
soil amendment.
Organic soil amendments contain carbon
and break down through bacterial activity, slow¬
ly yielding humus as an end product. Humus is
a soft, spongy material that binds minute soil
particles together, improving the soil texture.
New, actively composting organic soil amend¬
ments require nitrogen to carry on bacterial
decomposition. If they do not contain at least

Rich, thoroughly composted organic mat¬
ter amends texture and supplies nutrients.
Leaf mold, garden compost (at least one year
old), and many types of thoroughly composted
manure usually contain enough nitrogen for
their decomposition needs and release nitrogen
rather than using it. Purchase quality organic
amendments at a reputable nursery. Look care¬
fully at the descriptive text on the bag to see
if it is sterilized and is guaranteed to contain
no harmful insects: larvae, eggs, and fungi or
bad microorganisms. Contaminated soil causes
many problems that are easily averted by using
a clean mix.
Garden compost and leaf mold are usually
rich in organic nutrients and beneficial organ¬
isms that speed nutrient uptake, but they can
be full of harmful pests and diseases, too. For
example, compost piles are a favorite breeding
ground for cutworms and beetle larvae. Just one
cutworm in a container means certain death
for the defenseless marijuana plant. Garden
compost is best used in outdoor gardens and
not indoors. See below for more information on
garden compost.
Manure: Barnyard manure, a great fertilizer
for outdoor gardens, often contains toxic levels
of salt and copious quantities of weed seeds
and fungus spores that disrupt an indoor gar¬
den. If using manure, purchase it in bags that
guarantee its contents. There are many kinds
of manure: cow, horse, rabbit, and chicken, etc
See Chapter Eleven for a complete rundown
on manures, all of which help retain water and
improve soil texture when used as soil amend¬
ments. When mixing manures as amendments,
do not add more than 10-15 percent, to avoid
salt buildup and overfertilization. The nutrient
content of manures varies, depending upon the
animal's diet and the decomposition factors.
Peat is the term used to describe partially
decomposed vegetation. The decay has been
slowed by the wet and cold conditions of the
northern United States and Canada where it is
found in vast bogs. The most common types of
peat are formed from sphagnum and hypnum

mosses. These peats are harvested and used
to amend soil and can be used as a growing
medium. Peat moss is very dry, and difficult
to wet the first time, unless you bought it wet.
Wet peat is heavy and awkward to transport.
When adding peat moss as a soil amendment,
cut your workload by dry-mixing all of the com¬
ponents before wetting. Use a wetting agent.
Another trick to mixing peat moss is to kick the
sack a few times to break up the bale before
opening.
Peat tends to break down and should be used
for only one crop.
Sphagnum peat moss is light brown and the
most common peat found at commercial nurs¬
eries. This bulky peat gives soil body and retains
water well, absorbing 15 to 30 times its own
weight. It contains essentially no nutrients of its
own, and the pH ranges from 3-5. After decom¬
posing for several months, the pH could con¬
tinue to drop and become very acidic. Counter
this propensity for acidity and stabilize the pH by
adding fine dolomite lime to the mix.
Hypnum peat moss is more decomposed and
darker in color with pH from 5.0 to 7.0. This peat
moss is less common and contains some nutri¬
ents. Hypnum peat is a good soil amendment,
even though it cannot hold as much water as
sphagnum moss.

Coconut fiber is also called palm peat, coco
peat, cocos, kokos, and coir. Coir is coconut pith,
the fibery part just under the heavy husk. Pith is
soaked in water up to nine months to remove
salts, natural resins, and gums in a process
called retting. Next, they beat the straw-brown
coir to extract the husk.
Coir is biodegradable and a good medium for
propagation through flowering and fruit growth.
Coir holds lots of water while maintaining
structure. It is durable, rot-resistant, and a good
insulator, too. It is inexpensive, easy to control,
and holds lots of air.
Washed, pressed blocks or bricks of coir
are virtually inert. Bricks weigh about 1.3-2.2
pounds (0.6-1 kg.) The pH is between 5.5 and
6.8. Some of the best coconut coir is from the

interior of the Philippine Islands, where the
environment is not packed with coastal salts.
Quality coconut coir is guaranteed to have
sodium content of less than 50 ppm.
Growers use coir by itself or mixed 50/50 with
perlite or expanded clay to add extra drainage
to the mix. Some growers sprinkle coconut coir
on top of rockwool blocks to keep the top from
drying out.
Flake dry bricks of coconut coir apart by
hand or soak the bricks in a bucket of water
for 15 minutes to expand and wet. One brick
will expand to about 9 times its original size.
Growing in coconut coir is similar to growing in
any other soilless medium. Coconut coir may
stay a little too wet and require more ventilation
and air circulation.

tion on coconut fiber and growing marijuana.

Soil Mixes
Outdoor soil mixes that incorporate garden
soil, compost, manure, coco peat, and rock
powders grow some of the best plants in the
world. Outdoor soil mixes can be mixed a few
months early and left in the hole to blend and
mature. Outdoor organic soil mixes are alive,
and controlling the soil life is a matter of paying
attention to a few details.
Indoors, outdoor soil mixes often create more
trouble than they are worth. Too often misguided
novices go out to the backyard and dig up some
good-looking dirt that drains poorly and retains
water and air unevenly. The problems are com¬
pounded when they mix the dirt with garden
compost packed with harmful microorganisms
and pests. This lame soil mix grows bad dope.
By saving a few bucks on soil, such growers
create unforeseen problems and pay for their
savings many times over with low-harvest yields.
Avert problems with soil mixes by purchasing all
of the components. Use garden soil or compost
only if they are top quality and devoid of harm¬
ful pests and diseases. Use only the richest,
darkest garden soil with a good texture. Amend
the soil by up to 80 percent to improve water

retention and drainage. Even a soil that drains
well in the outdoor garden needs amending
to drain properly indoors. Check the pH of
the garden soil before digging to ensure it is
between 6.0 and 7.0. Add fine dolomite to
stabilize and buffer pH. Check pH several times
after mixing to ensure it is stable.
Solarize garden soil by putting it out in the
sun in a plastic bag for a few weeks. Turn the
bag occasionally to heat it up on all sides.
Make sure the bag receives full sun and heats
up to at least 140°F (60°C). This will kill the
bad stuff and let the beneficial bacteria live.
You can also sterilize soil by laying it out on
a Pyrex plate and baking it at 160°F for 10
minutes, or microwave it for two minutes at
the highest setting. It is much easier and more
profitable in the end to purchase good potting
soil at a nursery.

Compost
Compost is outstanding. It solves most prob¬
lems outdoors. Compost is an excellent soil
amendment. It holds nutrients and moisture
within its fiber. However, using backyard com¬
post indoors is tricky.
Compost piles must be at least 3 feet (90 cm) square
in order to retain more heat than they give off.

Some growers have no trouble with organic
composts, but others have bad luck and even

practical to use in containers. It could also have
unwanted pests. If using compost indoors,
make sure it is well-rotted and screened.
A good compost pile includes manure-the
older the better. Manure from horse stalls or
cattle feedlots is mixed with straw or sawdust
bedding. Sawdust uses available nitrogen and

is also acidic and not recommended. Look for
the oldest, and most-rotted manure. Well-rot¬
ted manure is less prone to have viable weed
seeds and pests. Fresh nitrogen-packed grass
clippings are one of my favorites to use in a
compost pile. Put your hand down deep into
a pile of grass clippings. The temperature one
or two feet down in such a pile ranges from
120° to 180°F (49° to 82°C). Heat generated
by chemical activity kills pests, breaks down
the foliage, and liberates the nutrients.
Build compost piles high, and keep turning
them. Good compost pile recipes include the
addition of organic trace elements, enzymes,
and the primary nutrients. The organic matter
used should be ground up and in the form
of shredded leaves and grass. Do not use
large woody branches that could take years
to decompose.
Before using compost indoors, pour it
through 0.25-inch mesh hardware cloth
(screen) to break up the humus before mixing
with soil. Place a heavy-duty framed screen
over a large garbage can or a wheelbarrow to
catch the sifted compost. Return earthworms
found on the screen to the medium and kill
cutworms. Make sure all composts are well
rotted and have cooled before mixing with
indoor soil. For more information about com¬
posting, see Let It Rot!, Third Edition, by Stu
Campbell, Storey Press, Prowal, VT.
Some growers mix up to 30 percent perlite
into organic potting soil that contains lots of
worm castings. Heavy worm castings compact
soil and leave little space for air to surround
roots. Adding perlite or similar amendments
aerates the soil and improves drainage.

Used Soil
• Let soil dry.
• Screen to separate roots, stems, and
foliage from the soil.
• Pack in plastic bags.
• Remove soil from property.
• Dispose of discreetly.

Growing Medium Disposal
Disposing of used growing medium can be
as big a problem as finding the proper soil.
Most soilless mixes and soils contain perlite,
which leaves white telltale traces when dumped
anywhere. Grow soil is also packed with incrimi¬
nating cannabis roots. The plug was pulled on
more than one grow-show because soil residu¬
als were found in the back yard.
Dry soil is easier to work and transport. Press
and rub dry soil through a 0.25 to 0.5-inch
screen to remove roots, stems, and foliage.
Screening also transforms the cast-container
shape of the soil to an innocuous form. Once
the roots are removed, dry, used soil can be
bagged up or compacted. Place the dry soil in
a trash compactor to make it smaller and more
manageable. Do not throw the spent growing
medium into your trash can. Remember, it is
not a crime for law enforcement in America
to dig through your garbage. In fact, picking
through a suspected grower's garbage is a tactic
often used by American authorities to secure a
search warrant. Remove the depleted soil from
the property. Take it to the dump or dispose of
it in a very discreet locale. Never throw away
the transporting bags with the used soil. Reuse
the bags.
Used indoor growing mediums make excel¬
lent outdoor amendments when mixed with
compost and garden soil. Do not reuse the
depleted soil in outdoor pots. Many of the
same problems that occur indoors will happen
in outdoor pots.

Grow Medium Problems
These maladies are caused by growing medi¬
um problems but manifest as nutrient prob¬
lems. The solution is found within the growing
medium.
When water is abundant in the growing
medium, roots easily absorb it. Roots use more
energy to absorb more water as it becomes
scarce. Finally, the point comes when the sub¬
strate retains more moisture than it surrenders,

and the roots receive no water. A good growing
medium readily yields its bank of stored water
and nutrients. A poor medium does not pass
enough nutrients to a plant's roots. The more
easily cannabis absorbs nutrients, the higher
the yield.
The cation-exchange-capacity (CEC) of a grow¬
ing medium is its capacity to hold cations that
are available for uptake by the roots. The CEC is

the number of cation charges held in 3.5 ounces
(100 gm) or 100 cc of soil and is measured in
milli-Equivalents (mEq) or Centi-Moles/kg on a
scale from 0-100. CEC of 0 means the substrate
holds no available cations for roots. CEC of 100
means the medium always holds cations avail¬
able for root uptake. Growing mediums that
carry a negative electrical charge are the best.

This chart shows different growing mediums'
ability to hold positive charges that are ready
for root uptake. Note the zero CEC of perlite
and rockwool. Roots must be constantly
bathed in nutrients. Other mediums do not
provide a constant flow of nutrients and the
CEC regulates the ability to hold a positive
charge to make nutrients available for root
uptake.

Container preference is often a matter of
convenience, cost, and availability. But the size,
shape, and color of a container can affect the
size and the health of a plant as well as the
versatility of the garden. Containers come in
all shapes and sizes and can be constructed of
almost anything-clay, metal, plastic, wood, and
wood fiber are the most common. Cannabis will
grow in any clean container that has not been
used for petroleum products or deadly chemi¬
cals. Clay fiber and wood containers breathe
better than plastic or metal pots. Heavy clay
pots are brittle and absorb moisture from the
soil inside, causing the soil to dry out quickly.
Metal pots are also impractical for grow rooms
because they oxidize (rust) and can bleed

off harmful elements and compounds. Wood,
although somewhat expensive, makes some of
the best containers, especially large raised beds
and planters on wheels. Plastic containers are
inexpensive, durable, and offer the best value to
indoor growers.
Rigid plastic pots are the most commonly
used containers in grow rooms. Growing in
inexpensive, readily available containers is bril¬
liant because they allow each plant to be cared
for individually. You can control each plant's
specific water and nutrient regimen. Individual
potted plants can also be moved. Turn pots
every few days, so plants receive even lighting
and foliage will grow evenly. Huddle small,
containerized plants tightly together under the
brightest area below the HID lamp, and move
them further apart as they grow. Set small
plants up on blocks to move them closer to the
HID. Individual plants are easily quarantined
or dipped in a medicinal solution. Weak, sick,
and problem plants are easy to cull from the
garden.
Grow bags are one of my favorite containers.
Inexpensive, long-lasting grow bags take up
little space and are lightweight. A box of 100
3-gallon (13 L) bags weighs less than 5 pounds
(2.3 kg) and measures less than a foot square.
One hundred 3-gallon (13 L) grow bags can be
stored in two 3-gallon (13 L) bags. Imagine stor¬
ing 100 rigid pots in the same space!

White pots reflect light and heat Black pots set

Grow bags are economical, lightweight, and
reusable.

The potting soil bag can also be used as a

Grow bags are very easy to wash and reuse.
Empty out the soilless mix and submerge bags
in a big container of soapy water overnight.
Wash each one by hand the next day and fill
with soil. I like them much better than rigid pots
because they are so practical.
The potting soil sack can be used as a con¬
tainer. The moist soil inside the bag holds its
shape well, and the bags expand and contract
with the soil, lessening the chance of burned
root tips that grow down the side of pots.
Fiber and paper-pulp pots are popular with
growers who move their plants outdoors. The
bottoms of the pots habitually rot out. Painting
the inside of the fiber container with latex paint
will keep the bottom from rotting for several
crops.
Set large pots on blocks or casters to allow air
circulation underneath. The soil stays warmer
and maintenance is easier. Planters should be
as big as possible but still allow easy access to
plants. The roots have more room to grow and
less container surface for roots to run into and
grow down. With large pots, roots are able to
intertwine and grow like crazy.
Grow beds can be installed right on the earth¬
en floor of a garage or basement. If drainage is
poor, a layer of gravel or a dry well can be made
under the bed. Some growers use a jackham¬
mer to remove the concrete floor in a basement
to get better drainage. An easier option is to cut
a hole in the basement floor and install a dry
well. Knocking holes in basement floors could

cause water seepage, where water tables are
high. When it rains, the water may collect under¬
neath; the garden seldom needs watering, but
plants are kept too wet.
A raised bed with a large soil mass can be
built up organically after several crops. To has¬
ten organic activity within the soil, add organic
seaweed, manure, and additives. When mixing
soil or adding amendments, use the best pos¬
sible organic components and follow organic
principles. There should be good drainage and
the soil should be as deep as possible, 12-24
inches (30-60 cm).
At the Cannabis College in Amsterdam,
Netherlands, they are growing in large soil beds
set on a concrete floor. The basement beds
are below sea level and filled with outstanding
Dutch cannabis. They are able to treat the beds
similar to outdoor soil beds, but when watered
heavily, water runs out on the floor and it must
be mopped up. They also have a problem with
ventilation. The ambient climate is naturally
humid and the extra water in the large base¬
ment increases humidity to above 90 percent,
day and night. They employ a large extraction

through the long narrow basement room quickly
and efficiently to evacuate moisture and lower
the humidity. Even with this much soil, they have
to flush individual beds at least once every four
weeks to avoid nutrient buildup.
Much heat can be generated by decompos¬
ing organic matter, and it warms the room.
Ventilation lowers heat and humidity, and helps
keep the room free of pests and diseases. An
organic garden sounds great, but it is a lot of
work to replicate the great outdoors. Most organ¬
ic growers opt for organic liquid fertilizers and a
bagged commercial organic soil mix.
Another drawback to raised beds is that the
crop will take a few days longer to mature than if
it were grown in containers. But the longer wait
is offset by a larger harvest.

Drainage
All containers need some form of drainage.
Drainage holes allow excess water and nutri¬
ent solution to flow freely out the bottom of a
container. Drainage holes should let water drain
easily, but not be so big that growing medium
washes out onto the floor. Containers should
have at least two half-inch (1.2 cm) holes per
square foot of bottom. Most pots have twice this
amount. To slow drainage and keep soil from
washing out of the large holes, add a one-inch
(3 cm) layer of gravel in the bottom of the pot.
Surface tension created by the varying sizes of
soil and rock particles cause water to be retained
at the bottom of the container. Line pots with
newspaper if drainage is too fast or if soil washes
out drain holes. This will slow drainage, so be
wary!
Put trays under containers to catch excess
water. Leaving water-filled saucers under pots
often causes root rot. To avoid water-logging soil
and roots, set containers up an inch or two on
blocks when using trays.
Nursery trays used for rooting cuttings and
growing seedlings must have good drainage
throughout the entire bottom. Once clones and
seedlings are in place in the tray, the tray should
always drain freely with no standing water in the
bottom.

Container Shape, Size, and
Maintenance
Popular pot shapes include rectangular and
cylindrical. Growers prefer taller pots rather than
wide, squat containers because the cannabis
root system penetrates deeply. Of all the gar¬
dens I have visited, squat pots were few and far
between. Growers I queried said squat pots may
hold more soil for their stature, but they do not
produce as extensive a root system.
The volume of a container can easily dictate
the size of a plant. Cannabis is an annual; it
grows very fast and requires a lot of root space
for sustained, vigorous development. Containers
should be big enough to allow for a strong root
system, but just big enough to contain the root
system before harvest. If the container is too
small, roots are confined, water and nutrient
uptake is limited, and growth slows to a crawl.
But if the container is too big, it requires too
much expensive growing medium and becomes
heavy and awkward to move.
Marijuana roots develop and elongate quickly,
growing down and out, away from the main
taproot. For example, about midsummer, nurs¬
eries have unsold tomato plants that are still in
small 4-inch (10 cm) pots and one-gallon (4
L) containers. The stunted plants have bloom¬
ing flowers and ripe fruit. But few branches
extend much beyond the sides of the container;
the plants are tall and leggy with curled down
leaves and an overall stunted, sickly appearance.
These plants are pot- or root-bound. Once a
plant deteriorates to this level, it is often easier
and more efficient to toss it out and replace it

the container wall. This condition is worst in
smooth plastic pots. When this crack develops,
frail root hairs located in the gap quickly die
when they are exposed to air whistling down
this crevice. Water also runs straight down this
crack and onto the floor. You may think the
pot was watered, but the root ball remains dry.

WATER & NUTRIENTS

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER'S BIBLE
Introduction
Water provides a medium to transport nutri¬
ents necessary for plant life and make them
available for absorption by the roots. Water
quality is essential for this process to work at
maximum potential. The laws of physics gov¬
ern plant water uptake. Applying these laws, a
grower can provide precise, properly balanced
components to grow outstanding marijuana
indoors.
Microscopic root hairs absorb water and nutri¬
ents in the oxygen present in the growing medi¬
um and carry them up the stem to the leaves.
This flow of the water from the soil through
the plant is called the transpiration stream. A
fraction of the water is processed and used in
photosynthesis. Excess water evaporates into
the air, carrying waste products along with it via
the stomata in the leaves. This process is called
transpiration. Some of the water also returns
manufactured sugars and starches to the roots.
The roots support the plants, absorb nutrients,
and provide the initial pathway into the vascular
system. A close-up look at a root reveals the
xylem and phloem core, vascular tissue that
is enveloped by a cortex tissue or the layer
between the internal vascular and the external
epidermal tissue. The microscopic root hairs
are located on the epidermal tissue cells. These
tiny root hair follicles are extremely delicate
and must remain moist. Root hairs must be
protected from abrasions, drying out, extreme
temperature fluctuations, and harsh chemical

concentrations. Plant health and well-being is
contingent upon strong, healthy roots.
The nutrient absorption begins at the root
hairs, and the flow continues throughout the
plant via the vascular system. Absorption is
sustained by diffusion. In the process of diffu¬
sion, water and nutrient ions are uniformly dis¬
tributed throughout the plant. The intercellular
spaces-apoplasts and connecting protoplasm,
symplast-are the pathways that allow the water
and nutrient ions and molecules to pass through
the epidermis and the cortex to the xylem and
phloem's vascular bundles. The xylem channels
the solution through the plant while phloem
tissues distribute the food manufactured by the
plant. Once the nutrients are transferred to the
plant cells, each cell accumulates the nutrients it
requires to perform its specific function.
The solution that is transported through the
vascular bundles or veins of a plant has many
functions. This solution delivers nutrients and
carries away the waste products. It provides
pressure to help keep the plant structurally
sound. The solution also cools the plant by
evaporating the water via the leaves' stomata.

Water Quality
The concentration of calcium (Ca) and mag¬
nesium (Mg) indicate how "hard" the water
is. Water containing 100 to 150 milligrams of
calcium (CaC03) per liter is acceptable to grow
marijuana. "Soft" water contains less than 50
milligrams of calcium per liter and should be
supplemented with calcium and magnesium.

Roots on this clone have reached the wall of the

WATER & NUTRIENTS

Water with high levels of chloride frequently
contains high levels of sodium, but the opposite
is not true. Water with high levels of sodium
does not necessarily contain excessive levels of
chloride (chlorine).
At low levels sodium appears to bolster yields,
possibly acting as a partial substitute to com¬
pensate for potassium deficiencies. But when
excessive, sodium is toxic and induces deficien¬
cies of other nutrients, primarily potassium,
calcium, and magnesium.
Chloride (chlorine) is essential to the use of
oxygen during photosynthesis, and it is neces¬
sary for root and leaf cell division. Chloride is
vital to increase the cellular osmotic pressure,
modify the stomata regulation, and augment
the plant's tissue and moisture content. A solu¬

tion concentration of less than 140 parts per
million (ppm) is usually safe for marijuana, but
some varieties may show sensitivity when foli¬
age turns pale green and wilts. Excessive chlo¬
rine causes the leaf tips and margins to burn
and causes the leaves to turn a bronze color.
Simple water filters do not clean dissolved
solids from the water. Such filters remove only
debris emulsified (suspended) in water; releas¬
ing dissolved solids from their chemical bond is
more complex. A reverse-osmosis machine uses
small polymer, semipermeable membranes that
allow pure water to pass through and filter out
the dissolved solids from the water. Reverseosmosis machines are the easiest and most
efficient means to clean raw water.

The drawing shows that pure water with no salts or dissolved
solids migrates to the solution with more dissolved solids.

239

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER'S BIBLE
Osmosis
The roots draw the nutrient solution up the
plant by the process of osmosis. Osmosis is the
tendency of the fluids to pass through a semipermeable membrane and mix with each other
until the fluids are equally concentrated on both
sides of the membrane. Semipermeable mem¬
branes located in the root hairs allow specific

nutrients that are dissolved in the water to enter
the plant while the other nutrients and impurities
are excluded. Since salts and sugars are concen¬
trated in the roots, the electrical conductivity (EC)
inside the roots is (almost) always higher than
that outside the roots. Transporting the nutrients
by osmosis works, because it depends on rela¬
tive concentrations of each individual nutrient on
each side of the membrane; it does not depend
on the total dissolved solids (TDS) or EC of the
solution. For nutrients to be drawn in by the roots
via osmosis, the strength of the individual ele¬
ments must be greater than that of the roots.
But, the transport of water (instead of nutrients)
across the semipermeable membrane depends
on EC. For example, if the EC is greater outside
the roots than inside, the plant dehydrates as the
water is drawn out of the roots. In other words,
salty water with a high EC can dehydrate the
plants.
Reverse-osmosis machines are used to sepa¬
rate the dissolved solids from the water. These
machines move the solvent (water) through the
semipermeable membrane, but the process is
reversed. It moves from lower concentrations to
higher. The process is accomplished by apply¬
ing pressure to the "tainted" water to force only
"pure" water through the membrane. The water
is not totally "pure" with an EC of "0," but most of
the dissolved solids are removed. The efficiency
of reverse osmosis depends on the type of mem¬
brane, the pressure differential on both sides of
the membrane, and the chemical composition of
the dissolved solids in the tainted water.
Unfortunately, common tap water often con¬
tains high levels of sodium (Na), calcium (Ca),
alkaline salts, sulfur (S), and chlorine (Cl). The
pH could also be out of the acceptable 6.5 to 7
range. Water containing sulfur is easily smelled
and tasted. Saline water is a little more difficult
to detect. Water in coastal areas is generally full
of salt that washes inland from the ocean. Dry
regions that have less than 20-inches-annual
rainfall also suffer from alkaline soil and water
that is often packed with alkaline salts.
Table salt, sodium chloride (NaCl), is added to
many household water systems. A small amount
of chlorine, below 140 ppm, does not affect
marijuana growth, but higher levels cause foliage
chlorosis and stunt growth. Do not use salt-soft-

Chapter ELEVEN
ened water. Salty, brackish, salt-softened water is detrimental
to cannabis. Chlorine also tends to acidify soil after repeated
applications. The best way to get chlorine out of the water is
to let it sit one or two days in an open container. The chlorine
wiil evaporate (volatilize) as a gas when it comes in contact
with the air. If chlorine noticeably alters soil pH, adjust it with
a commercial "pH UP" product or hydrated lime.
The metric system facilitates the measurement of "dry
residue per liter." Measure the dry residue per liter by pour¬
ing a liter of water on a tray and allowing it to evaporate.
The residue of dissolved solids that remains after all of the
water evaporates is the "dry residue per liter." The residue is
measured in grams. Try this at home to find out the extent of
impurities. Fertilizers have a difficult time penetrating root tis¬
sue when they must compete with resident dissolved solids.
Water that is loaded with high levels of dissolved solids
(salts in solution) is possible to manage but requires different
tactics. Highly saline water that contains sodium will block
the uptake of potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Salt-laden
water will always cause problems. If water contains 300
ppm or less dissolved solids, allow at least 25 percent of the
irrigation water to drain out of the bottom of containers with
each watering. If raw water contains more than 300 ppm of
dissolved solids; use a reverse-osmosis device to purify the
water. Add nutrients to pure water as a way to avoid many
nutrient problems.
Dissolved salts, caused by saline water and fertilizer, quickly
build up to toxic levels in container gardens. Excessive salts
inhibit seed germination, burn the root hairs and tips or edges
of leaves, and stunt the plant. Flush excess salt buildup from
growing mediums by applying two gallons of water per gal¬
lon of medium and repeat leaching using a mild pH-corrected
fertilizer solution. Leach growing medium every two to four
weeks, if using soft water or saline water. Hard water and well
water in dry climates are often alkaline, and usually contain
notable amounts of calcium and magnesium. Cannabis uses
large quantities of both nutrients, but too much calcium and
magnesium can build up in soil. In general, water that tastes
good to people also tastes good to cannabis.

irrigation
Large plants use more water than small plants, but there
are many more variables than size that dictate a plant's water
consumption. The age of the plant, container size, soil texture,
temperature, humidity, and ventilation all contribute to water
needs. Change any one of these variables, and the water
consumption will change. Good ventilation is essential to
promote a free flow of fluids, transpiration, and rapid growth.
The healthier a plant, the faster it grows and the more water
it needs.

Small plants with a small root system in small containers
must be watered often. Water frequently-as soon as the soil
surface dries out. If exposed to wind, the small plants will dry
out very quickly:
Irrigate soil and soilless mixes when they are dry one-half
inch below the surface. As long as the drainage is good, it is
difficult to overwater fast-growing cannabis. Four-week-old
clones flowering in 2- to 3-gallon (7.5 to 11 L) containers need
to be irrigated once or twice daily. In fact, most growers prefer
smaller containers because they are easier to control.
Irrigate larger plants in the vegetative and flowering stages
when soil is dry one-half inch below the surface. Flowering
marijuana uses high levels of water to carry on rapid floral
formation. Withholding the water stunts the flower formation.
Plants that are exposed to wind dry out much faster.
Outdoor, terrace, and patio plants will use up to three or four
times more water on a hot, windy day. Keeping up with the
watering is difficult and time-consuming. Use an automated
watering system or break the wind to lessen its impact on the
plants. Mulch will also lessen the evaporation from the soil.
Use plenty of water, and allow up to 10 percent runoff dur¬
ing each watering. The runoff will prevent the fertilizer from
building up in the soil. Water early in the day, so excess water
will evaporate from the soil surface and the leaves. Leaving the
foliage and the soil wet overnight invites a fungal attack.
Moisture meters take most of the guesswork out of irrigating.
They can be purchased for less than $30 and are well worth
the money. The meter measures exactly how much water
the soil contains at any level or point. Often the soil will not
hold the water evenly, and it develops dry pockets. Checking
the moisture with a finger provides an educated guess but
disturbs the root system. A moisture meter will give an exact
moisture reading without disturbing the roots.
Cultivate the soil surface to allow the water to penetrate
evenly and guard against dry soil pockets. It also keeps the
water from running down the crack between the inside of
the pot and the soil and out the drain holes. Gently break up
and cultivate the top half inch of the soil with your fingers or a
salad fork. Be careful not to disturb the tiny surface roots.
After you develop some skill at knowing when the plants
need water, you can check to see how heavy they are simply
by tipping them. Once you get the hang of it, all you will have
to do is tip each container.
It is easier to keep pots in straight lines when growing and
watering, and it is much easier to keep track of watered pots
when they are in a straight line.
Overwatering is a common problem, especially with small
plants. Too much water drowns the roots by cutting off their
supply of oxygen. If you have symptoms of overwatering, buy

easier. Sometimes, parts of the soil are overwatered and other
soil pockets remain bone-dry. Cultivating the soil surface,
allowing even water penetration, and using a moisture meter
will overcome this problem. One of the main causes of over¬
watering is poor air ventilation! The plants need to transpire
water into the air. If there is nowhere for this wet, humid
air to go, gallons of water are locked in the grow room air.
Well-ventilated air carries this moist air away, replacing it with
fresh, dry air. If using trays to catch runoff water, use a turkey
baster, iarge syringe, or sponge to draw the excess water from
the tray. Signs of overwatering are: leaves curled down and
yellowed, waterlogged and soggy soil, fungal growth, and
slow growth. Symptoms of overwatering are often subtle, and
inexperienced gardeners may not see any blatant symptoms
for a long time.
Marijuana does not like soggy soil. Soil kept too wet drowns
the roots, squeezing out the oxygen. This causes slow growth
and possible fungal attack. Poor drainage is most often the
cause of soggy soil. It is compounded by poor ventilation and
high humidity.
Underwatering is less of a problem; however, it is fairly
common if small (1-2 gallon) pots are used and the grower
does not realize the water needs of rapid growing plants.
Small containers dry out quickly and may require daily water¬
ing. if forgotten, water-starved plants become stunted. Once
tender root hairs dry out, they die. Most growers panic when
they see their prize-marijuana plants wilt in bone-dry soil.
Dry soil, even in pockets, makes root hairs dry up and die. It
seems to take forever for the roots to grow new root hairs and
resume rapid growth.
Add a few drops (one drop per pint) of a biodegradable,
concentrated liquid soap like Castille® or Ivory® to the water.
It will act as a wetting agent by helping the water penetrate
the soil more efficiently, and it will guard against dry soil
pockets. Most soluble fertilizers contain a wetting agent. Apply
about one-quarter to one-half as much water/fertilizer as the
plant is expected to need, and then wait 10 to 15 minutes for
it to totally soak in. Apply more water/fertilizer until the soil
is evenly moist. If trays are underneath the pots, let excess
water remain in the trays a few hours or even overnight before
removing it with a large turkey baster.
Another way to thoroughly wet pots is to soak the containers
in water. This is easy to do with small pots. Simply fill a 5-gal¬
lon (19 L) bucket with 3 gallons (11 L) of water. Submerge the
smaller pot inside the larger pot, for a minute or longer, until
the growing medium is completely saturated. Wetting plants
thoroughly insures against dry soil pockets.
Having a readily accessible water source is very convenient,
and it saves time and labor. A 4 x 4-foot garden containing 16
healthy plants in 3-gallon (11 L) pots needs 10 to 25 gallons

(40-100 L) of water per week. Water weighs eight pounds a
gallon (1 kg per L). That's a lot of containers to fill, lift, and
spill. Carrying water in containers from the bathroom sink
to the garden is okay when plants are small, but when they
are large, it is a big, sloppy, regular job. Running a hose into
the garden saves much labor and mess. A lightweight, half¬
inch hose is easy to handle and is less likely to damage the
plants. If the water source has hot and cold water running
out of the same tap, and it is equipped with threads, attach
a hose and irrigate with tepid water. Use a dishwasher cou¬
pling if the faucet has no threads. The hose should have an
on/off valve at the outlet, so water flow can be controlled
while watering. A rigid water wand will save many broken
branches while leaning over to water in tight quarters. Buy
a water wand at the nursery or construct one from plastic
PVC pipe. Do not leave water under pressure in the hose
for more than a few minutes. Garden hoses are designed
to transport water, not hold it under pressure, which may
cause it to rupture.
To make a siphon or gravity-fed water system, place a bar¬
rel, at least four feet high, in the grow room. Make sure it
has a lid to reduce the evaporation and the humidity. If the
grow room is too small for the barrel, move it to another
room. The attic is a good place because it promotes good
pressure. Place a siphon hose in the top of the tank, or
install a PVC on/off valve near the bottom of the barrel. It is
easy to walk off and let the barrel overflow. An inexpensive
device that measures the gallons of water added to the bar¬
rel is available at most hardware stores. You can also install
a float valve in the barrel to meter out the water and retain
a constant supply.
Drip systems deliver nutrient solution one drop at a time
or in low volume, via a low-pressure plastic pipe with fric¬
tion fittings. Water flows down the pipe and out the emitter
one drop at a time or at a very slow rate. The emitters that
are attached to the main hose are either spaghetti tubes or
a nozzle dripper actually emitting from the main hose. Drip
irrigation kits are available at garden stores and building
centers. You can also construct your own drip system from
component parts.
Drip systems offer several advantages. Once set up, drip
systems lower watering maintenance. Fertilizer may also
be injected into the irrigation system (fertigation); naturally,
this facilitates fertilization but gives the same amount of
water and nutrient to each plant. If setting up a drip system,
make sure the growing medium drains freely to prevent
soggy soil or salt buildup. If you are growing clones that are
all the same age and size, a drip system would work very
well. However, if you are growing many different varieties of
plants, they may need different fertilizer regimens.

Chapter ELEVEN
I interviewed several growers that loved the convenience
and constant feeding-ability of their drip systems. All the
growers irrigated (fertigated) with mild nutrient solution.
They mixed the nutrient solution in a reservoir and pumped it
through plastic feeder hoses. They also grew clones in smaller
containers and kept root growth to a minimum by keeping
the nutrients and the water in constant supply.
A drip system attached to a timer disperses nutrient solu¬
tion at regular intervals. If using such a system, check the soil
for water application daily. Check several pots daily to ensure
they are watered evenly and that all the soil gets wet. Drip
systems are very convenient and indispensable when you
have to be away for a few days. However, do not leave a drip
system on its own for more than four consecutive days, or
you could return to a surprise!
Drip systems cost a few dollars to set up, but with the
consistency they add to a garden, their expense is often
paid off by a bountiful yield. Be careful! Such an automated
system could promote negligence. Remember that gardens
need daily care. If everything is automated, the garden still
needs monitoring. All the vital signs: moisture, pH, ventila¬
tion, humidity, etc., still need to be checked and adjusted
daily. Automation, when applied properly, adds consistency,
uniformity, and usually a higher yield.
One indoor grower I met was out of town for five consecu¬
tive days every week. He watered and fertilized his plants.
He put containerized plants in a tray with 2-inch-tall (6 cm)
sides and watered the plants from above until the tray was
full of water. He left for five days, and the plants needed no
watering while he was gone. He used regular potting soil and
added about 10 percent perlite. His plants needed mainte¬
nance when he returned, but the plants grew quite well.

Misdiagnosed Disorders
Many indoor garden problems, and to a lesser degree
outdoor problems, are misdiagnosed as a lack of fertilizer.
Often, disease and insects cause such problems. Other times,
problems are caused by an imbalanced pH of the growing
medium and water. A pH between 6.5 and 7 in soil and
5.8 to 6.5 in hydroponics will allow nutrients to be chemi¬
cally available; above or below this range, several nutrients
become less available. For example, a full point movement
in pH represents a tenfold increase in either alkalinity or
acidity. This means that a pH of 5.5 would be ten times more
acidic than a pH of 6.5. In soil, a pH below 6.5 may cause
a deficiency in calcium, which causes root tips to burn and
leaves to get fungal infections and dead spots on foliage. A
pH over 7 could slow down the plant's iron intake and result
in chlorotic leaves causing veins to yellow.

Incorrect pH contributes to most serious nutri¬
ent disorders in organic-soil gardens. Many
complex biological processes occur between
organic fertilizers and the soil during nutrient
uptake. The pH is critical to the livelihood of
these activities. When the pH fluctuates in a
hydroponic garden, the nutrients are still avail¬
able in the solution for uptake, and the pH is not
as critical. Electrical conductivity is the most criti¬
cal indicator of plant health and nutrient uptake
in hydroponics.
Once a plant shows symptoms, it has already
undergone severe nutritional stress. It will take
time for the plant to resume vigorous growth.
Correct identification of each symptom as soon
as it occurs is essential to help plants retain
vigor. Indoor, greenhouse, and some outdoor
marijuana crops are harvested so fast that plants
do not have time to recover from nutrient imbal¬
ances. One small imbalance could cost a week
of growth. That could be more than 10 percent
of the plant's life!

Here is another prime example of heat stress
coupled with salt buildup and a lack of Zn, Fe,
and Mn.

Do not confuse nutrient
deficiencies or toxicities with
insect and disease damage or
poor cultural practices.
The temperature within the
leaves can climb to an excess
of 110°F (43°C). It happens
easily because the leaves
store the heat radiated by the
lamp. At 110°F (43°C), the
internal chemistry of a mari¬
juana leaf is disrupted. The
manufactured proteins are
broken down and become
unavailable to the plant. As
the internal temperature of
the leaves climbs, they are
forced to use and evaporate
more water. About 70 per¬
cent of the plant's energy is
used in this process.
The basic elements of
the environment must be
checked and maintained at
specific levels to avoid prob¬
lems. Check each of the vital
signs—air, light, soil, water,
temperature, humidity, etc.and fine-tune the environ¬
ment, especially ventilation,
before deciding that plants
are nutrient deficient.
Nutrient deficiencies are
less common when using
fresh potting soil fortified
with micronutrients. If the soil
or water supply is acidic, add
dolomite lime to buffer the
soil pH and to keep it sweet.
Avoid nutrient problems by
using fresh planting mix,
clean water, and a complete
nutrient solution. Maintain
the EC and pH at proper lev¬
els, and flush the system with
mild nutrient solution every
four weeks.

WATER & NUTRIENTS
COMMON CULTURAL PROBLEMS
Here is a short list of some of the most common cultural
problems. Some of them result in nutrient deficiencies.
1. Lack of ventilation: Leaves are stifled and unable to
function, causing slow growth and poor consumption
of water and nutrients.
2. Lack of light: Nutrients are used poorly, photosynthesis
is slow, stems stretch, and growth is scrawny.
3. Humidity: High humidity causes the plants to use less
water and more nutrients. Growth is slow because
stomata are not able to open and increase the transpi¬
ration. Low humidity stresses the plants because they
use too much water.
4. Temperature: Both low and high temperatures slow
the growth of plants. Large fluctuations in tempera¬
ture-more than 15 to 20°F (8 to 10°C)-causes slow
growth and slows the plant's process.
5. Spray application damage: Sprays are phytotoxic, and
they can burn the foliage if the spray is too concen¬
trated or if sprayed during the heat of the day.
6. Ozone damage: See Chapter Thirteen "Air" for more
information on ozone damage.
7. Overwatering: Soggy soil causes a menagerie of prob¬
lems. It cuts the air from the roots, which retards the
nutrient intake. The plant's defenses weaken. Roots rot
when severe.
8. Underwatering: Dry soil causes nutrient transport to
slow severely. It causes nutrient deficiencies and sick
foliage, and the roots die.
9. Light burn: Burned foliage is susceptible to pest and
disease attack.
10. Indoor air pollution: This causes very difficult-tosolve plant problems. Always be aware of chemicals
leaching or vaporizing from the pressboards and other
building materials. Such pollution causes plant growth
to slow to a crawl.
11. Hot soil: Soil over 90°F (32°C) will harm the roots.
Often, outdoor soil that is used in the containers
warms up to well over 100°F (38°C).
12. Roots receiving light: Roots turn green if the light
shines through the container or the hydroponic sys¬
tem. Roots require a dark environment. Their function
slows substantially when they turn green.

Nutrients
Nutrients are elements that the plant needs
to live. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are
absorbed from the air and the water. The rest
of the elements, called nutrients, are absorbed
from the growing medium and nutrient solu¬

tion. Supplemental nutrients supplied in the
form of a fertilizer allow marijuana to reach
its maximum potential. Nutrients are grouped
into three categories: macronutrients or primary
nutrients, secondary nutrients, and micronu¬
trients or trace elements. Each nutrient in the
above categories can be further classified as
either mobile or immobile.
Mobile nutrients-nitrogen (N), phosphorus
(P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and zinc
(Zn)-are able to translocate, move from one
portion of the plant to another as needed. For
example, nitrogen accumulated in older leaves
translocates to younger leaves to solve a defi¬
ciency. The result, deficiency symptoms appear
on the older, lower leaves first.
Immobile nutrients-calcium (Ca), boron (B),
chlorine (Cl), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe),
manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), silicon
(Si) and sulfur (S)-do not translocate to new
growing areas as needed. They remain depos¬
ited in their original place in older leaves. This is
the reason deficiency symptoms appear first in
the upper, new leaves on top of the plant.
Mobile nutrients translocate within a plant.
They move to the specific part of the plant
where they are needed; this causes the older
leaves to show deficiencies first.

I would like to thank the scientists at

toxicities in cannabis. The research team at

gen and requires high levels of it during vegeta¬
tive growth but lower levels during the balance
of life. Nitrogen is easily washed away and
must be replaced regularly, especially during
vegetative growth. Excess levels of nitrogen in
harvested plants cause the dried marijuana to
burn poorly.
Technical Information: Nitrogen regulates
the cannabis plant's ability to make proteins
essential for new protoplasm in the cells.
Electrically charged nitrogen allows the plant
to tie proteins, hormones, chlorophyll, vitamins,
and enzymes together. Nitrogen is essential
for the production of amino acids, enzymes,
nucleic acids, and chlorophyll and alkaloids.
This important nutrient is mainly responsible

Chapter ELEVEN
for leaf and stem growth, as well as overall
size and vigor. Nitrogen is most active in young
buds, shoots, and leaves. Ammonium (NH4+)
is the most readily available form of nitrogen.
Be careful when using too much of this form; it
can burn the plants. Nitrate (N03-)-the nitrate
form of nitrogen-is much slower to assimilate
than ammonium. Hydroponic fertilizers use this
slower-acting nitrogen compound and mix it
with ammonium.
Deficiency: Nitrogen is the most common
nutrient deficiency. The symptoms include slow
growth. Lower leaves cannot produce chloro¬
phyll and become yellow between the veins
while the veins remain green. Yellowing pro¬
gresses through the entire leaf, eventually caus¬
ing it to die and drop off. Stems and the leaves'
undersides may turn reddish-purple, but this
can also be a sign of a phosphorus deficiency.
Nitrogen is very mobile, and it dissipates into
the environment quickly. It must be added regu¬
larly to sustain fast-growing gardens.

Progression of deficiency symptoms at a
glance:
Older leaves yellow between the veins (interveinal chlorosis).
Older bottom leaves turn entirely yellow.
More and more leaves yellow. Severely affect¬
ed leaves drop.
Leaves might develop reddish-purple stems
and veins on leaf undersides.
Progressively younger leaves develop interveinal chlorosis.
All foliage yellows and the leaf drop is severe.

Treat deficiency by fertilizing with N or a com¬
plete N-P-K fertilizer. You should see results in
four to five days. Fast-acting organic sources of
nitrogen include seabird guano, fish emulsion,
and blood meal. Growers also report excellent
results by adding bio-fertilizers (see "Additives"
page 285) to stimulate the uptake of nitrogen.
Toxicity: An overdose of nitrogen will cause
excessively lush foliage that is soft and sus¬
ceptible to stress, including insect and fungal
attacks. The stems become weak and they may
fold over easily. The vascular transport tissue
breaks down, and water uptake is restricted.
In severe cases, leaves turn a brownish-copper

Phosphorus (P) - mobile
Practical Information: Cannabis uses the

3

highest levels of phosphorus during germina¬
tion, seedling, cloning, and flowering. Super
Bloom fertilizers, designed for flowering, have
high levels of phosphorus.
Technical Information: Phosphorus is neces¬
sary for photosynthesis and provides a mecha¬
nism for the energy to transfer within the plant.
Phosphorus-one of the components of DNA,
many being enzymes and proteins-is associ¬
ated with overall vigor, resin, and seed produc¬
tion. The highest concentrations of phosphorus
are found in root¬
growing tips, growing
shoots, and vascular
tissue.

seed yield is poor,

and plants become very vulnerable to fungal
and insect attack. Phosphorus deficiencies are
aggravated by clay, acidic, and soggy soils.
Zinc is also necessary for proper utilization of
phosphorus.
Deficiencies are somewhat common and are
often misdiagnosed. Deficiencies are most com¬
mon when the growing-medium pH is above 7
and phosphorus is unable to be absorbed prop¬
erly; the soil is acidic (below 5.8) and/or there is
an excess of iron and zinc; the soil has become
fixated (chemically bound) with phosphates.

Progression of deficiency symptoms at a
glance:
Stunted and very slow-growth plants.
Dark bluish-green leaves, often with dark
blotches.
Plants are smaller overall.
When blotches overcome the leaf stem, the
leaf turns bronzish-purple, contorts, and drops.

Treat deficiency by lowering the pH to 5.56.2 in hydroponic units; 6 to 7 for clay soils;
and 5.5-6.5 for potting soils so phosphorus will
become available. If the soil is too acidic, and
an excess of iron and zinc exists, phosphorous
becomes unavailable. If you are growing in soil,
mix a complete fertilizer that contains phospho¬
rus into the growing medium before planting.
Fertigate with an inorganic, complete hydro¬
ponic fertilizer that contains phosphorus. Mix
in the organic nutrients-bat guano, steamed
bone meal, natural phosphates, or barnyard
manure-to add phosphorus to soil. Always
use finely ground organic components that are
readily available to the plants.
Toxic signs of phosphorus may take sev¬
eral weeks to surface, especially if excesses
are buffered by a stable pH. Marijuana uses a
lot of phosphorus throughout its life cycle, and
many varieties tolerate high levels. Excessive
phosphorus interferes with calcium, copper,
iron, magnesium, and zinc stability and uptake.
Toxic symptoms of phosphorus manifest as a
deficiency of zinc, iron, magnesium, calcium
and copper; zinc is the most common.
Treat toxicity by flushing the growing medium
of affected plants with a very mild and complete

Chapter ELEVEN
fertilizer. Severe problems require more water to
be flushed through the growing medium. Flush
a minimum of three times the volume of water
for the volume of the growing medium.

Potassium (K) - mobile
Practical Information: Potassium is used at
all stages of growth. Soils with a high level of
potassium increase a plant's resistance to bac¬
teria and mold.
Technical information: Potassium helps com¬
bine sugars, starches, and carbohydrates, which
is essential to their production and movement.
It also is essential to growth by cell division.
It increases the chlorophyll in the foliage and
helps to regulate the stomata openings so
plants make better use of the light and air.
Potassium is essential in the accumulation and
translocation of carbohydrates. It is necessary to
make the proteins that augment the oil content
and improve the flavor in cannabis plants. It also
encourages strong root growth and is associ¬
ated with disease resistance and water intake.
The potash form of potassium oxide is (K20).
Deficiency Potassium-starved plants initially
appear healthy. Deficient plants are susceptible
to disease. Symptoms include the following:
older leaves (first tips and margins, followed by
whole leaves) develop spots, turn dark yellow,
and die. Stems often become weak and some¬
times brittle. Potassium is usually present in the
soil, but it is locked in by high salinity. First, leach
the toxic salt out of the soil and then apply a
complete N-P-K fertilizer. Potassium deficiency
causes the internal temperature of the foliage to
climb and the protein cells to burn or degrade.
Evaporation is normally highest on leaf edges,
and that’s where the burning takes place.

Secondary Nutrients
The secondary nutrients-magnesium, calcium,
and sulfur-are also used by the plants in
large amounts. Rapid-growing indoor marijuana
crops are able to process more secondary nutri¬
ents than most general-purpose fertilizers are
able to supply. Many growers opt to use high
quality two- and three-part hydroponic fertilizers
to supply all necessary secondary and trace ele¬
ments. But be careful, these three nutrients may
be present in high levels in the ground water. It
is important to consider these values when add¬
ing nutrient supplements. If growing in a soil or
soilless mix with a pH below 7 such as Peat-Lite,
incorporating one cup of fine (flour) dolomite
lime per gallon of medium ensures adequate
supplies of calcium and magnesium.
Macronutrients are the elements that the
plants use most. The fertilizers usually show
nitrogen (N), potassium (P), phosphorous (K)
as (iN-P-K) percentages in big numbers on the
front of the package. They are always listed in
the same N-P-K order. These nutrients must
always be in an available form to supply mari¬
juana with the building blocks for rapid growth.

Magnesium (Mg) - mobile
Practical Information: Marijuana uses a lot
of magnesium, and deficiencies are common,
especially in acidic (pH below 7) soils. Adding
dolomite lime to acidic potting soils before
planting will stabilize the pH, plus it will add
magnesium and calcium to the soil. Add Epsom
salts with each watering to correct magnesium
deficiencies, if no dolomite was added when
planting. Use Epsom salts designed specifically
for plants rather than the supermarket-type.
Technical Information: Magnesium is found
as a central atom in every chlorophyll molecule,
and it is essential to the absorption of light
energy. It aids in the utilization of nutrients.
Magnesium helps enzymes make carbohydrates
and sugars that are later transformed into flow¬
ers. It also neutralizes the soil acids and toxic
compounds produced by the plant.
Deficiency: Magnesium deficiency is common
indoors. The lower leaves, and later the middle
leaves, develop yellow patches between dark,
green veins. Rusty-brown spots appear on the

leaf margins, tips, and between the veins, as
the deficiency progresses. The brownish leaf
tips usually curl upward before dying. The entire
plant could discolor in a few weeks, and if severe,
turn a yellow-whitish tinge before browning and
dying. A minor deficiency will cause little or no
problem with growth. However, minor deficien¬
cies escalate and cause a diminished harvest as
flowering progresses. Most often, magnesium is
in the soil but is unavailable to the plant because
the root environment is too wet and cold or
acidic and cold. Magnesium is also bound
in the soil if there is an excess of potassium,
ammonia (nitrogen), and calcium (carbonate).
Small root systems are also unable to take in
enough magnesium to
supply heavy demand.
A high EC slows the
water evaporation and
will also diminish mag¬
nesium availability.

Younger leaves develop rust-colored spots and

The leaves dry and die in extreme cases.

Treat deficiency by watering with two tea¬
spoons of Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) per
gallon of water. For fast results, spray the foliage
with a 2 percent solution of Epsom salts. If the
deficiency progresses to the top of the plant, it
will turn green there first. In four to six days, it
will start moving down the plant, turning lower
leaves progressively more green. Continue a
regular watering schedule with Epsom salts until
the symptoms totally disappear. Adding Epsom
salts regularly is not necessary when the fertil¬
izer contains available magnesium. Use a foliar
spray of Epsom salts for a fast cure. Another
option is to apply magnesium sulfate monohy¬
drate in place of Epsom salts. Add fine dolomite
lime to soil and soilless mix to add a consistent
supply of both calcium and magnesium over
the long term. Always use the finest dolomite
available.
Control the room and root-zone temperatures,
humidity, pH, and EC of the nutrient solution.
Keep root zone and nutrient solution at 70 to
75°F (21-24°C). Keep ambient air temperature
at 75°F (21 °C) day and 65°F (18°C) night. Use
a complete fertilizer with an adequate amount
of magnesium. Keep the soil pH above 6.5, the
hydroponic pH above 5.5, and reduce high EC
for a week.
The extra magnesium in the soil is generally not
harmful, but it can inhibit calcium uptake. Signs
of excess magnesium are described below.
Toxicity: Magnesium toxicity is rare and dif¬
ficult to discern with the naked eye. If extremely
toxic, the magnesium develops a conflict with
other fertilizer ions, usually calcium, especially in
hydroponic nutrient solutions. The toxic buildup
of magnesium in soil that is able to grow mari¬
juana is uncommon.

Calcium (Ca) - immobile
Practical Information: Cannabis requires
nearly as much calcium as other macronutrients.
Avert deficiencies in the soil and in most soilless
mixes by adding fine dolomite lime or using
soluble-hydroponic fertilizers containing ade¬
quate calcium.

WATER & NUTRIENTS
Technical Information: Calcium is fundamen¬
tal to cell manufacturing and growth. Calcium is
necessary to preserve membrane permeability
and cell integrity, which ensures proper flow of
nitrogen and sugars. It stimulates enzymes that
help build strong celi and root walls. Cannabis
must have some calcium at the growing tip of
each root.
Deficiency of calcium is somewhat uncom¬
mon indoors, but not uncommon in fiber hemp.
Frequently, plants can process more calcium
than is available. It also washes out of the leaves
that are sprayed with water. Deficiency signs
may be difficult to detect. They start with weak
stems, very dark green foliage, and exception¬
ally slow growth. Young leaves are affected, and
they show the signs first. Severe calcium defi¬
ciency causes new, growing shoots to develop
yellowish to purple hues and to disfigure before
shriveling up and dying; bud development is
inhibited, the plants are stunted, and harvest
is diminished. Growing tips could show signs
of calcium deficiency if the humidity is maxed
out. At 100 percent humidity, the stomata close,
which stops the transpiration to protect the
plant. The calcium that is transported by transpi¬
ration becomes immobile.
Treat deficiencies by dissolving one-half tea¬
spoon of hydrated lime per gallon of water.
Water the deficient plants with calcium-dosed
water as long as the symptoms persist. Or use
a complete hydroponic nutrient that contains
adequate calcium. Keep the pH of the growing
medium stable.

Progression of deficiency symptoms at a
glance:
Slow growth and young leaves turn very dark
green.
New growing shoots discolor.
New shoots contort, shrivel, and die.
Bud development slows dramatically.
Toxicity is difficult to see in the foliage. It
causes wilting. Toxic levels also exacerbate defi¬
ciencies of potassium, magnesium, manganese,
and iron. The nutrients become unavailable,
even though they are present. If excessive
amounts of soluble calcium are applied early
in life, it can also stunt the growth. If growing
hydroponically, an excess of calcium will precipi253

tate with sulfur in the solution, which causes the
nutrient solution to suspend in the water and
to aggregate into clumps causing the water to
become cloudy (flocculate). Once the calcium
and sulfur combine, they form a residue (gyp¬
sum Ca(S04)-2(H20)) that settles to the bottom
of the reservoir.

Sulfur (S) - immobile

V

Practical Information: Many fertilizers contain
some form of sulfur, and for this reason, sulfur
is seldom deficient. Growers avoid elemental
(pure) sulfur in favor of sulfur compounds such
as magnesium sulfate. The nutrients combined
with sulfur mix better in water.
Technical Information: Sulfur is an essential
building block of many hormones and vitamins,
including vitamin Br Sulfur is also an indispens¬
able element in many plant cells and seeds.
The sulfate form of sulfur buffers the water
pH. Virtually all ground, river, and lake water
contains sulfate. Sulfate is involved in protein
synthesis and is part of the amino acid, cystine,
and thiamine, which are the building blocks of
proteins. Sulfur is essential in the formation of
oils and flavors, as well as for respiration and
the synthesis and breakdown of fatty acids.
Hydroponic fertilizers separate sulfur from cal¬
cium in an "A" container and a "B" container.
If combined in a concentrated form, sulfur
and calcium will form crude, insoluble gypsum
(calcium sulfate) and settle as residue to the
bottom of the tank.
Deficiency: Young leaves turn lime-green to
yellowish. As shortage progresses, leaves yellow
interveinally and lack succulence. Veins remain
green, and leaf stems and petioles turn purple.
Leaf tips can burn, darken, and hook downward.
According to literature, youngest leaves should
yellow first. But Mauk from Canna Coco in the
Netherlands, who has conducted detailed scien¬
tific experiments with nutrients, says, "We have
repeatedly noticed that the symptoms were
most obvious in the older leaves." Sulfur defi¬
ciency resembles a nitrogen deficiency. Acute
sulfur deficiency causes elongated stems that
become woody at the base.
Sulfur deficiency occurs indoors when the pH
is too high or when there is excessive calcium
present and available.

to apply only well-rot¬
ted manures to avoid burning the roots.
Toxicity: An excess of sulfur in the soil causes
no problems if the EC is relatively low. At a high
EC, the plants tend to take up more available
sulfur which blocks uptake of other nutrients.
Excess sulfur symptoms include overall smaller
plant development and uniformly smaller, darkgreen foliage. Leaf tips and margins could dis¬
color and burn when severe.
Treat toxicity by flushing the growing medium
of affected plants with a very mild and complete
fertilizer. Check the pH of the drainage solution.
Correct the input pH to 6. Severe problems
require more water to be flushed through the
growing medium. Flush a minimum of three
times the volume of water for the volume of the
growing medium.

MICRONUTRIENTS
Zinc, iron, and manganese are the
three most common micronutrients
found deficient. Deficiencies of these
three micronutrients plague many
more grow rooms than I had imagined.
Often deficiencies of all three occur
concurrently, especially when the soil
or water pH is above 6.5. Deficiencies
are most common in arid dimatesSpain, the Southwestern United States,
Australia, etc.-with alkaline soil and
water. All three have the same initial
symptom of deficiency: interveinal
chlorosis of young leaves. It is often
difficult to distinguish which elementzinc, iron, or manganese-is deficient,
and all three could be deficient. This
is why treating the problem should
include adding a chelated dose of all
three nutrients.

WATER & NUTRIENTS
elements. For best results, and to ensure a
complete range of trace elements is available,
use fertilizers designed for hydroponics. High
quality hydroponic fertilizers use food-grade
ingredients that are completely soluble and
leave no residues. If using an inexpensive fertil¬
izer that does not list a specific analysis for each
trace element on the label, it's a good idea to
add soluble trace elements in a chelated form.
Chelated micronutrients are available in pow¬
dered and liquid form. Add and thoroughly mix
micronutrients into the growing medium before
planting. Micronutrients are often impregnated
in commercial potting soils and soilless mixes.
Check the ingredients on the bag to ensure that
the trace elements were added to the mix. Trace
elements are necessary in minute amounts but
can easily reach toxic levels. Always follow the
manufacturer's instructions to the letter when
applying micronutrients, because they are easy
to over-apply.

Zinc (Zn) - mobile
Practical Information: Zinc is the most com¬

Micronutrients
Micronutrients, also called trace elements
or trace nutrients, are essential to chlorophyll
formation and must be present in minute
amounts. They function mainly as catalysts
to the plant's process and utilization of other

mon micronutrient found deficient in arid cli¬
mates and alkaline soils.
Technical Information: Zinc works with man¬
ganese and magnesium to promote the same
enzyme functions. Zinc cooperates with other
elements to help form chlorophyll as well as

A chelate (Greek for claw) is an organic molecule that forms a claw-like bond with free
electrically charged metal particles. This property keeps metal ions such as zinc, iron, and
manganese, etc., soluble in water, and the chelated metal's reactions with other materials is
suppressed. Roots take in the chelated metals in a stable, soluble form that is used immedi¬
ately.
Natural chelates such as humic acid and citric acid can be added to organic soil mixes.
Roots and bacteria also exude natural chelates to promote the uptake of metallic elements.
Man-made chelates are designed for use in different situations. DTPA is most effective in a
pH below 6.5, EDDHA is effective up to a pH of 8, and EDTA chelate is slow to cause leaf
burn.
Chelates decompose rapidly in low levels of ultraviolet (UV) light including light produced
by HID bulbs and sunlight. Keep chelates out of the light to protect them from rapid decom¬
position.

prevent its demise. It is an essential catalyst
for most plants' enzymes and auxins, and it is
crucial for stem growth. Zinc plays a vital part
in sugar and protein production. It is fairly com¬
mon to find zinc-deficient cannabis. Deficiencies
are most common in soils with a pH of 7 or
more.
Deficiency: Zinc is the most common micro¬
nutrient found deficient. First, younger leaves
exhibit interveinal chlorosis, and new leaves
and growing tips develop small, thin blades
that contort and wrinkle. The leaf tips, and later
the margins, discolor and burn. Burned spots
on the leaves could grow progressively larger.
These symptoms are often confused with a lack
of manganese or iron, but when zinc deficiency
is severe, new leaf
blades contort and
dry out. Flower buds
also contort into odd
shapes, turn crispy dry,
and are often hard. A
lack of zinc stunts all
new growth including
buds.

Toxicity: Zinc is extremely toxic in excess.
Severely toxic plants die quickly. Excess zinc
interferes with the iron's ability to function
properly and causes an iron deficiency.

Manganese (Mn) - immobile
Practical Information: Manganese defi¬
ciency is relatively common indoors.
Technical Information: Manganese is
engaged in the oxidation-reduction process
associated with the photosynthetic elec¬
tron transport. This element activates many
enzymes and plays a fundamental part in the
chloroplast membrane system. Manganese
assists nitrogen utilization along with iron in
chlorophyll production.
Deficiency: Young leaves show symptoms
first. They become yellow between veins
(interveinal chlorosis), and the veins remain
green. Symptoms spread from younger to
older leaves as the deficiency progresses.
Necrotic (dead) spots develop on severely
affected leaves which become pale and fall off;
overall plant growth is stunted, and maturation
may be prolonged. Severe deficiency looks like
a severe lack of magnesium.
Treat deficiency: Lower the pH, leach the
soil, and add a complete, chelated micronutri¬
ent formula.

Progression of deficiency symptoms at a

Interveinal chlorosis of young leaves forms.
Interveinal chlorosis of progressively older

Dead spots develop on acutely affected
leaves.

Toxicity: Young and newer growth develop
chlorotic, dark orange to dark, rusty-brown
mottling on the leaves. Tissue damage shows
on young leaves before progressing to the
older leaves. Growth is slower, and overall
vigor is lost. Toxicity is compounded by low
humidity. The additional transpiration causes
more manganese to be drawn into the foliage.
A low pH can cause toxic intake of manganese.
An excess of manganese causes a deficiency of
iron and zinc.

contain adequate iron
for cannabis growth.
Deficiency: Iron deficiencies are common
when the pH is above 6.5 and uncommon
when the pH is below 6.5. Symptoms may
appear during rapid growth or stressful times
and disappear by themselves. Young leaves are
unable to draw immobile iron from older leaves,
even though it is present in the soil. The first
symptoms appear on the smaller leaves as veins
remain green and areas between the veins turn
yellow. Interveinal chlorosis starts at the oppo¬
site end of the leaf tip: the apex of the leaves
attached by the petiole. Leaf edges can turn
upward as the deficiency progresses. Leaves fall
off in severe cases. Iron deficiency is sometimes
traced to an excess of copper. See "Copper."

v-i

Treat deficiency by lowering the soil pH to
6.5 or less. Avoid fertilizers that contain exces¬
sive amounts of manganese, zinc, and copper,
which inhibit iron uptake. High levels of phos¬
phorus compete with
the uptake of iron.
Improve the drain¬

soil holds little oxygen
to spur iron uptake.

lates, include cow, horse, and chicken manure.
Use only well-rotted manures to avoid burning
plants.
Toxicity: Excess of iron is rare. High levels of
iron do not damage cannabis, but it can inter¬
fere with phosphorus uptake. An excess of iron
causes the leaves to turn bronze accompanied
by small, dark brown leaf spots. If iron chelate is
over applied, it will kill the plant in a few days.

gardeners should keep boron dosage below 20
parts per million (ppm), because boron quickly
becomes toxic if it is concentrated in the solu¬
tion.
Toxicity: Leaf tips yellow first, and as the
toxic conditions progress, leaf margins become
necrotic toward the center of the leaf. After the
leaves yellow, they fall off. Avoid using excessive
amounts of boric acid-based insecticides.

Chlorine (Chloride) (Cl) - immobile
The following group of micronutrients is sel¬
dom found deficient. Avoid deficiencies by using
a high-quality hydroponic fertilizer that contains
chelated micronutrients.

Boron (B) - immobile
Practical Information: Usually causes no

problems, but boron must be available during
the entire life of a plant.
Technical Information: Boron deficiencies
seldom occur indoors. Boron is still somewhat
of a biochemical mystery. We know that boron
helps with calcium uptake and numerous plant
functions. Scientists have collected evidence to
suggest boron helps with synthesis, a base for
the formation of nucleic acid (RNA uracil) for¬
mation. Strong evidence also supports boron's
role in cell division, differentiation, maturation,
and respiration as well as a link to pollen ger¬
mination.
Deficiency: Stem tip and root tip grow abnor¬
mally. Root tips often swell, discolor, and stop
elongating. Growing shoots look burned and
may be confused with a burn from being too
close to the HID light. First leaves thicken and
become brittle, top shoots contort and/or turn
dark, which is later followed by progressively
lower-growing shoots. When severe, growing
tips die, and leaf margins discolor and die back
in places. Necrotic spots develop between
leaf veins. Root steles (insides) often become
mushy-perfect hosts for rot and disease.
Deficient leaves become thick, distorted, and
wilted with chlorotic and necrotic spotting.
Treat deficiency: Boron-deficient plants with
one teaspoon of boric acid per gallon of water.
You can apply this solution as a soil drench to
be taken up by the roots, or apply hydroponic
micronutrients containing boron. Hydroponic

Practical Information: Chloride is found in
many municipal water systems. Cannabis toler¬
ates low levels of chlorine. It is usually not a
component of fertilizers and is almost never
deficient in gardens that grow cannabis.
Technical Information: Chlorine, in the form
of chloride, is fundamental to photosynthesis
and cell division in the roots and the foliage.
It also increases osmotic pressure in the cells,
which open and close the stomata to regulate
moisture flow within the plant tissue.
Deficiency: It is uncommon to be deficient.
Young leaves pale and wilt, and roots become
stubby. As the deficiency progresses, leaves
become chlorotic and develop a characteristic
bronze color. The roots develop thick tips and
become stunted. NOTE: Both severe deficiency
and excess of chloride have the same symp¬
toms: bronze-colored leaves.
Treat deficiency: Add chlorinated water.
Toxicity: Young leaves develop burned leaf
tips and margins. Very young seedlings and
clones are the most susceptible to damage.
Later, the symptoms progress throughout the
plant. Characteristic yellowish-bronze leaves are
smaller and slower to develop.
Treat toxicity: Let heavily chlorinated water
sit out overnight, stirring occasionally. Chlorine
will volatize and disappear into the atmosphere.
Use this water to mix the nutrient solution or to
irrigate the garden.

Cobalt (Co) - immobile
Practical Information: This nutrient is seldom
mentioned as necessary for plant growth, and
most fertilizer labels do not include cobalt.
Cobalt is virtually never deficient in indoor can¬
nabis gardens.
Technical Information: Cobalt is necessary

Chapter ELEVEN
for countless beneficial bacteria to grow and
flourish. It is also vital for nitrogen absorption.
Scientific evidence suggests this element is
linked to enzymes needed to form aromatic
compounds.
Deficiency: When deficient, the problems with
nitrogen availability occur.

Copper (Cu) - immobile
Practical Information: Copper is concentrated
in the roots. It is also used as a fungicide.
Technical Information: Copper is a com¬
ponent of numerous enzymes and proteins.
Necessary in minute amounts, copper helps
with carbohydrate metabolism, nitrogen fixa¬
tion, and the process of oxygen reduction. It also
helps with the making of proteins and sugars.
Deficiency: Copper deficiencies are not rare.
Young leaves and growing shoots wilt, leaf
tips and margins develop necrosis and turn a
dark, copper-gray. Occasionally, an entire cop¬
per-deficient plant wilts, drooping even when
adequately watered. Growth is slow and the
yield decreases. A small deficiency can cause
new shoots to die back.
Treat deficiency: Apply a copper-based fungi¬
cide such as copper sulfate. Do not apply if the
temperature is above 75°F (24°C) to avoid burn¬
ing the foliage. Apply a complete hydroponic
nutrient that contains copper. Cannabis plants
seldom develop a copper deficiency.
Toxicity: Copper, although essential, is extreme¬
ly toxic to the plant even in minor excess. Toxic
levels slow the overall plant growth. As the
toxic level climbs, symptoms include interveinal
iron chlorosis (deficiency) and stunted growth.
Fewer branches grow, and the roots become
dark, thick, and slow growing. Toxic conditions
accelerate quickly in acidic soils. Hydroponic
gardeners must carefully monitor their solution
to avoid copper excess.
Treat toxicity: Flush the soil or the growing
medium to help expel the excess copper. Do
not use copper-based fungicides.

Molybdenum (Mb) - immobile
Practical Information: Molybdenum is sel¬
dom deficient.

Technical Information: Molybdenum is a

WATER & NUTRIENTS
part of two major enzyme systems that convert
nitrate to ammonium. This essential element is
used by cannabis in very small quantities. It is
most active in roots and seeds.
Deficiency: This micronutrient is almost never
found deficient in cannabis. Deficiency pro¬
motes nitrogen shortage. First, the older and
middle-aged leaves yellow, and some develop
interveinal chlorosis; then the leaves continue
to yellow and develop cupped or rolled-up
margins as the deficiency progresses. Acute
symptoms cause the leaves to become severely
twisted, die, and drop. Overall growth is stunted.
Deficiencies are worst in acidic soils.
Toxicity: Excess is uncommon in marijuana
gardens. An excess of molybdenum causes a
deficiency of copper and iron.

Silicon - (Si)
Practical Information: Silicon is readily avail¬
able in most soils, water, and as far as I know, it
does not cause cannabis any complications due
to deficiencies or excesses.
Technical information: Silicon is absorbed by
the plants as silicic acid. Silicon assists in keep¬
ing iron and manganese levels consistent. It is
found mainly in the epidermal cell walls where
it collects in the form of hydrated amorphous
silica. It also accumulates in the walls of other
cells. Adequate and soluble silicon guarantees
stronger cell walls that resist pest attacks and
increase heat and drought tolerance.
Deficiency: A lack of silicon has been proven
to decrease yields of some fruits and cause new
leaves to deform.
Excess: Never heard of a problem.
NOTE: Pests and diseases have a difficult time
penetrating the plants that are sprayed with a
silicon-based repellent/insecticide.

Nickel - (Ni)
Enzymes require nickel to break down and use
the nitrogen from the urea. It is also essential
to iron absorption. Seldom deficient and subtly

guaranteed analysis of commercial fertilizer
mixes. Federal and state laws require nutrient
concentrations to appear prominently on the
face of the fertilizer packages, even though the
accuracy of the values is dubious.
Do you think the N-P-K numbers on the label
give the percentages of nitrogen, phospho¬
rous, and potassium? Well, yes and no. The
scale measures nutrients with different scales.
Nitrogen is listed as total combined elemen¬
tal. Most hydroponic fertilizers break nitrogen
into slow-acting nitrate (N03) and ammonium
(NH^. Phosphoric anhydride (P205) is listed
as the form of phosphorus, but this figure
understates phosphorus content by 44 percent.
It gets worse! The balance (56 percent) of the
phosphorus molecule is comprised of oxygen.
Twenty percent P205 is 8.8 percent actual phos¬
phorous. Potassium (K) is listed in the potash
form of potassium oxide (K20) of which 83
percent of the stated value is actually elemental
potassium.
The rest of the mineral nutrients are listed in
their elemental form that represents the actual
content. Most often, the mineral elements used
in the fertilizer formulas are listed in chemical
compounds on the label. Look at the fertilizer
labels to ensure that the elements, especially
trace elements, are chelated and readily avail¬
able for root absorption. Also, be careful about
having too much sodium in your water/nutrient
solution. The sodium will block potassium and
several other nutrients, causing deficiencies and
slow growth.
Nutrients in the United States are measured
in parts-per-million (ppm), even though they
are expressed as a percentage concentration
on the label. The ppm scale is simple and
finite-almost. The basics are simple: one part
per million is one part of 1,000,000, so divide by
one million to find parts per million. To convert
percentages into ppm, multiply by 10,000 and
move the decimal four (4) spaces to the right.
For example: two percent equals 20,000 ppm.
For more information on ppm and Electrical
Conductivity, see Chapter Twelve, "Hydroponic
Gardening."
Fertilizers are either water-soluble or partially
soluble (gradual-release). Both soluble and
gradual-release fertilizers can be organic or
chemical.

WATER & NUTRIENTS
These are the suggested soluble-salts fer¬
tilizer recommendations for indoor cannabis
cultivation. The values are expressed in parts
per million.

Chemical Fertilizers
The diversity of hydroponic fertilizers is amaz¬
ing. Local shop owners know which ones
work best in the local climate and water. Local
storeowners know a lot about the local water
and the growers' needs. They are in a perfect
position to develop their own nutrient solution
or adapt one that works well with their water. A
few manufacturers do not do their homework
and make bad nutrients. Most manufacturers
are conscious and manufacture excellent fertil¬
izers. As always, read the entire fertilizer label
and follow the directions.
Soluble-chemical fertilizers are an excellent
choice for indoor container cultivation. Soluble
fertilizers dissolve in water and are easy to con¬
trol, and they can be easily added or washed
(leached) out of the growing medium. Control
the exacting amounts of nutrients available
to the plants in an available form with watersoluble fertilizers. The soluble fertilizer may be
applied in a water solution onto the soil. In
general, high-quality hydroponic fertilizers that
use completely soluble food-grade nutrients
are the best value. Avoid low-quality fertilizers
that do not list all necessary micronutrients on
the label.
Chemical granular fertilizers work well but can
easily be over applied, creating toxic soil. They
are almost impossible to leach out fast enough
to save the plant.
Osmocote™ chemical fertilizers are time release
and are used by many nurseries because they
are easy to apply and only require one applica¬
tion every few months. Using this type of fertil¬
izer may be convenient, but exacting control is
lost. They are best suited for ornamental, con¬
tainerized plants where labor costs and uniform
growth are the main concerns.

Organic Fertilizers

taste, but implementing an organic indoor gar¬
den requires horticultural know-how. The lim¬

must be considered when growing organically.
Outdoors, organic gardening is easy because all
of the forces of nature are there for you to seek
out and harness. Indoors, few of the natural
phenomena are free and easy. Remember, you
are Mother Nature and must create everything!
The nature of growing indoors does not lend
itself to long-term organic gardens, but some
organic techniques have been practiced with
amazing success.
Most indoor organic gardens use potting soil
high in worm castings, peat, sand, manure, leaf

mold, compost, and fine dolomite lime. In a
container, there is little space to build the soil by
mixing all kinds of neat composts and organic
nutrients to cook down. Even if it were possible
to build the soil in a container, it would take
months of valuable growing time and it could
foster bad insects, fungi, etc. It is easier and safer
to throw old, depleted soil outdoors, and start
new plants with fresh organic soil.
Organic nutrients, manure, worm castings,
blood and bone meal, etc., all work very well to
increase the soil nutrient content, but nutrients
are released and available at different rates. The
nutrient availability may be tricky to calculate,
but it is somewhat difficult to over-apply organic
fertilizers. Organic nutrients seem to be more
consistently available when used in combination
with one another. Usually, growers use a mix
of about 20 percent worm castings with other
organic agents to get a strong, readily available
nitrogen base. They fertilize with bat guano, the
organic super bloom, during flowering.
An indoor garden using raised beds allows
true organic methods. The raised beds have
enough soil to hold the nutrients, promote
organic activity, and when managed properly,
ensure a constant supply of nutrients. The raised
beds must have enough soil mass to promote
heat and fundamental organic activity.
Outdoor organic gardens are easy to imple¬
ment and maintain. Using compost tea,
manures, bulky compost, and other big, smelly
things is much easier outdoors.

WATER & NUTRIENTS

Organic Teas
Compost teas not only contain soluble organic
nutrients diluted in water, but they support
a potent elixir that is loaded with beneficial
microbes that fight off pests and diseases. For
example, a quarter teaspoon of a well-made
compost tea holds more than a billion bacteria
and at least 15 feet of fungi strands! A good
compost tea also contains thousands of dif¬
ferent species of protozoa, nematodes, and
mycorrhiza! fungi.
Disease-causing organisms are unable to
compete with beneficial bacteria and fungi.
Beneficial bacteria also work to break down
plant residues and toxic materials, plus they
improve soil structure and water-holding ability.
The best teas are made from well-rotted com¬
post, because it contains a complex collection
of microbes and nutrients. Just make sure the
compost pile has heated to 135°F (52°C) for at
least 3 days to ensure it is free of most diseases.
You can usually buy quality compost at the local
nursery. If using manure, make sure it has been
well-composted.
You can brew the tea in a 5-gallon (19 L)
bucket. Add about a gallon (3.8 L) of rotted
compost or manure to 4 gallons (15 L) of water.
Stir well, and let the mix sit for several days.
You can also put sifted compost into a nylon
stocking, and submerge it in the bucket. To stir,
simply bounce the stocking around in the water.
Stir the mixture gently several times a day to
integrate oxygen and remove microbes from
the compost. Adequate oxygen keeps the brew

fresh. If it starts to smell foul, anaerobic bacteria
are present. Add fresh water and stir more often.
The good aerobic bacteria re-establish as soon
as they have an ample supply of oxygen.
Dilute the tea at the rate of 1 to 5 with water.
Add more water to the same bucket, and con¬
tinue to brew 3 to 4 more batches before start¬
ing a new batch.

Organic Nutrients Chart
Alfalfa meal has 2.5 percent nitrogen, 5 per¬
cent phosphorus, and about 2 percent pot¬
ash. Outdoor growers use pelletized animal
feed as a slow-release fertilizer.
Blood and bone meal are wonderful organic
fertilizers, but could transport Mad Cow
Disease and other maladies. I can't recom¬
mend these with a clear conscience.
Blood (dried or meal) is collected at slaugh¬
terhouses, dried, and ground into a powder
or meal. It's packed with fast-acting soluble
nitrogen (12 to 15 percent by weight), about
1.2 percent phosphorus, and under onepercent potash. Apply carefully because it's
easy to bum foliage. We advise avoiding use
of any dried blood or blood meal that could
carry Mad Cow Disease.
Bone meal is rich in phosphorus and nitrogen.
The age and type of bone determine the
nutrient content of this pulverized slaugh¬
terhouse product. Older bones have higher
phosphorus content than young bones. Use

bone meal in conjunction with other organic
fertilizers for best results. Its lime content
helps reduce soil acidity and acts fast in wellaerated soil. We advise avoiding any bone
meal that could carry Mad Cow Disease.
Raw, unsteamed bone meal contains 2 to
4 percent nitrogen and 15 to 25 percent
phosphorus. Fatty acids in raw bone meal
retard decomposition. We advise avoiding
any bone meal that could carry Mad Cow
Disease.
Steamed or cooked bone meal is made from
fresh animal bones that have been boiled
or steamed under pressure to render out
fats. The pressure treatment causes a little
nitrogen loss and an increase in phospho¬
rus. Steamed bones are easier to grind into
a fine powder, and the process helps nutri¬
ents become available sooner. It contains
up to 30 percent phosphorus and about 1.5
percent nitrogen. The finer the bone meal is
ground, the faster it becomes available.
Cottonseed meal is the leftover by-product
of oil extraction. According to the manu¬
facturer, virtually all chemical residues from
commercial cotton production are dissolved
in the oil and not found in the meal. This
acidic fertilizer contains about 7 percent
nitrogen, 2.5 percent phosphorus, and 1.5
percent potash. It should be combined with
steamed bone meal and seaweed to form a
balanced fertilizer blend.
Chicken manure is rich in available nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements.
Indoor growers most often prefer to pur¬
chase dry', composted chicken manure in a
bag. Use it as a topdressing or mix it with the
soil before planting. Often chicken manure
collected from farms is packed with feath¬
ers, which contain as much as 17 percent
nitrogen; this is an added bonus. The aver¬
age nutrient content of wet chicken manure
is as follows: N - 1.5%, P - 1.5%, K - 0.5%;
and dry chicken manure, N - 4%, P - 4%,
K - 1.5%. Both have a full range of trace
elements.
Coffee grounds are acidic and encourage ace¬
tic bacteria in the soil. Drip-coffee grounds

are the richest, and contain about 2 percent
nitrogen and traces of other nutrients. Add
this to the compost pile or scatter and
cultivate it in. Use it as topdressing, but in
moderation, because it is very acidic.
Compost tea is used by many organic garden¬
ers as the only source of fertilizer. Comfrey is
packed with nutrients, and many gardeners
grow it just to make compost tea.
Cow manure is sold as steer manure, but it is
often collected from dairy herds. Gardeners
have used cow manure for centuries, and
this has led to the belief that it is a good
fertilizer as well as a soil amendment. Steer
manure is most valuable as mulch and a
soil amendment. It holds water well and
maintains fertility for a long time. The nutri¬
ent value is low, and it should not be relied
upon for the main source of nitrogen. The
average nutrient content of cow manure is N
- 0.6%, P - 0.3%, K - 0.3%, and a full range
of trace elements. Apply at the rate of 25 to
30 pounds per square yard.
Diatomaceous earth, the fossilized skeletal
remains of fresh and saltwater diatoms, con¬
tains a full range of trace elements, and it is
a good insecticide. Apply it to the soil when
cultivating or as a topdressing.
Dolomite lime adjusts and balances the pH
and makes phosphates more available.
Generally applied to sweeten or deacidify
the soil. It consists of calcium and magne¬
sium, and is sometimes listed as a primary
nutrient, though it is generally referred to as
a secondary nutrient.
Feathers and feather meal contain from 12
to 15 percent nitrogen that is released slow¬
ly. Feathers included in barnyard chicken
manure or obtained from slaughterhouses
are an excellent addition to the compost pile
or as a fertilizer. Feathers are steamed under
pressure, dried, and ground into a powdery
feather meal. Feather meal contains slowrelease nitrogen of about 12.5 percent.
Fish meal is made from dried fish ground
into a meal. It is rich in nitrogen (about 8
percent) and contains around 7 percent
phosphoric acid and many trace elements.

Chapter ELEVEN
!t has an unpleasant odor, causing it to be
avoided by indoor growers. It is a great
compost activator. Apply it to the soil as
a fast-acting topdressing. To help control
odor, cultivate it into the soil or cover it with
mulch after applying. Always store it in an
airtight container, so it will not attract cats,
dogs, or flies. Fish meal and fish emulsion
can contain up to 10 percent nitrogen. The
liquid generally contains less nitrogen than
the meal. Even when deodorized, the liquid
form has an unpleasant odor.
Fish emulsion, an inexpensive soluble liquid,
is high in organic nitrogen, trace elements,
and some phosphorus and potassium. This
natural fertilizer is difficult to over-apply, and
it is immediately available to the plants.
Even deodorized fish emulsion smells like
dead fish. Inorganic potash is added to the
fish emulsion by some manufacturers and is
semi-organic.
Coat manure is much like horse manure but
more potent. Compost this manure and
treat it as you would horse manure.
Granite dust or granite stone meal contains
up to 5 percent potash and several trace
elements. Releasing nutrients slowly over
several years, granite dust is an inexpensive
source of potash and does not affect soil pH.
Not recommended indoors because it is too
slow acting.
Greensand (glaucomite) is an iron-potassium
silicate that gives the minerals in which it
occurs a green tint. It is mined from ancient
New Jersey-seabed deposits of shells and
organic material rich in iron, phosphorus,
potash (5 to 7 percent), and numerous
micronutrients. Some organic gardeners do
not use Greensand because it is such a lim¬
ited resource. Greensand slowly releases its
treasures in about four years. This is too slow
acting for indoor gardens.
Guano (bat) consists of the droppings and
remains of bats. It is rich in soluble nitrogen,
phosphorus, and trace elements. The limited
supply of this fertilizer-known as the solu¬
ble organic super bloom-makes it some¬
what expensive. Mined in sheltered caves,

guano is usually
powdery and is used any time of year as top¬
dressing or diluted in a tea. Do not breathe
the dust when handling it, because it can
cause nausea and irritation.
Guano (sea bird) is high in nitrogen and other
nutrients. The Humboldt Current, along the
coast of Peru and northern Chile, keeps
the rain from falling, and decomposition
of the guano is minimal. South American
guano is the world's best guano. The guano
is scraped off rocks of arid sea islands.
Guano is also collected from many coast¬
lines around the world, so its nutrient
content varies.
Gypsum (hydrated calcium sulfate) is used to
lower the soil pH, and it improves drainage
and aeration. It is also used to hold or slow
the rapid decomposition of nitrogen. This is
seldom used indoors.
Hoof and horn meal is an excellent source
of slow-release nitrogen. Fine-ground horn
meal makes nitrogen available quicker and
has few problems with fly maggots. Soil
bacteria must break it down before it is
available to the roots. Apply it two to three
weeks before planting. It remains in the
soil for six months or longer. Hoof and
horn meal contains from 6 to 15 percent
nitrogen and about 2 percent phosphoric
acid. We advise avoiding use of any dried
blood or bone meal that could carry Mad
Cow Disease.

265

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER'S BIBLE
Horse manure is readily available from horse
stables and racetracks. Use horse manure that
has straw or peat for bedding, since wood
shavings could be a source of plant disease.
Compost horse manure for two months or
longer before adding it to the garden. The
composting process kills weed seeds, and it
will make better use of the nutrients. Straw
bedding often uses up much of the available
nitrogen. Nutrient content of horse manure is
N - 0.6%, P - 0.6%, K - 0.4%, and a full range
of trace elements.
Kelp is the Cedilla of trace minerals. Kelp
should be deep-green, fresh, and smell like
the ocean. Seaweed contains 60 to 70 trace
minerals that are already chelated (existing
in a form that's water soluble and mobile in
the soil). Check the label to ensure all ele¬
ments are not cooked out. See Seaweed on
this page.
Oyster shells are ground and normally used
as a calcium source for poultry. They contain
up to 55 percent calcium and traces of many
other nutrients that release slowly. Not practi¬
cal to use indoors because they breakdown
too slowly.
Paper ash contains about 5 percent phosphorus
and over 2 percent potash. It is an excellent
water-soluble fertilizer, but do not apply in
large doses, because the pH is quite high.
Paper ash is also full of toxic inks.
Pigeon manure has a very high concentration of
nitrogen but is difficult to find. It can be used
in the same fashion as chicken manure.
Rabbit manure is also excellent fertilizer but can
be difficult to find in large quantities. Use rab¬
bit manure as you would chicken or pigeon
manure. According to John McPartland, rabbit
poop is the best. Bunnies rule!
Potash rock supplies up to 8 percent potassium
and may contain many trace elements. It
releases too slowly to be practical indoors.
Rock phosphate (hard) is a calcium or limebased phosphate rock that is finely ground to
the consistency of talcum powder. The rock
powder contains over 30 percent phosphate

266

and a menagerie of trace elements, but it is
available very, very slowly.
Colloidal phosphate (powdered or soft phos¬
phate) is a natural clay phosphate deposit
that contains just over 20 percent phosphorus
(P205), calcium, and many trace elements. It
yields only 2 percent phosphate by weight the
first few months.
Seaweed meal and/or kelp meal is harvested
from the ocean or picked up along the
beaches, cleansed of salty water, dried, and
ground into a powdery meai. It is packed
with potassium (potash), numerous trace ele¬
ments, vitamins, amino acids, and plant hor¬
mones. The nutrient content varies according
to the type of kelp and growing conditions.
Seaweed meal is easily assimilated by the
plants, and contributes to soil life, structure,
and nitrogen fixation. It may also help the
plants resist many diseases and withstand
light frosts. Kelp meal also eases transplant
shock.
Seaweed (liquid) contains nitrogen, phospho¬
rus, potash, all necessary trace elements in
a chelated form, as well as plant hormones.
Apply diluted solution to the soil for a quick
cure of nutrient deficiencies. Liquid seaweed
is also great for soaking seeds and, dipping
cuttings and bare roots before planting.
Sheep manure is high in nutrients and makes a
wonderful tea. The average nutrient content
is: N - 0.8%, P - 0.5%, K - 0.4%, and a full
range of trace elements. Sheep manures
contain little water and lots of air. They heat
up readily in a compost pile. Cow and pig
manures are cold because they hold a lot of
water and can be compacted easily, squeez¬
ing out the air.
Shrimp & crab wastes contain relatively high
levels of phosphorus.
Sulfate of potash is normally produced chemi¬
cally by treating rock powders with sulfu¬
ric acid, but one company, Great Salt Lake
Minerals and Chemicals Company, produces
a concentrated natural form. The sulfate of
potash is extracted from the Great Salt Lake.

Chapter ELEVEN

WATER & NUTRIENTS

Swine manure has a high nutrient content
but is slower acting and wetter (more
anaerobic) than cow and horse manure.
The average nutrient content of pig manure
is: N - 0.6%, P - 0.6%, K - 0.4%, and a full
range of trace elements.
Wood ashes (hardwood) supply up to 10
percent potash, and softwood ashes con¬
tain about 5 percent. Potash leaches rapid¬
ly. Collect the ash soon after burning, and
store in a dry place. Apply in a mix with
other fertilizers at the rate of one-quarter
cup per 3-gallon pot (25 cl per 11 L).
The potash washes out of the wood ash
quickly and can cause compacted, sticky
soil. Avoid using alkaline wood ashes in
soil with a pH above 6.5.
Worm castings are excreted, digested humus
and other (decomposing) organic matter
that contain varying amounts of nitrogen
as well as many other elements. They are
an excellent source of non-burning soluble
nitrogen and an excellent soil amendment
that promotes fertility and structure. Mix
with the potting soil to form a rich, fertile
blend. Pure worm castings look like coarse
graphite powder and are heavy and dense.
Do not add more than 20 percent worm
castings to any mix. They are so heavy that
root growth can be impaired. Worm cast¬
ings are very popular and easier to obtain
at commercial nurseries.
Note: The nutrients in organic fertilizers may
vary greatly depending upon source, age,
erosion, climate, etc. For exact nutrient
content, consult the vendor's specifica¬
tions.

Mixing Fertilizers
Always read the entire label, and follow the
directions. To mix, dissolve the powder and the
crystals into a little warm water, and make sure
it is totally dissolved before adding the balance
of the tepid water. This will ensure that the fertil¬
izer and the water mix evenly. Liquid fertilizers
can be mixed directly with water.
Containers have very little growing medium
in which to hold the nutrients, and toxic salt
buildup may become a problem. Follow dosage
instructions to the letter. Adding too much fertil¬
izer will not make the plants grow faster. It could
change the chemical balance of the soil, supply
too much of a nutrient, or lock in other nutrients
making them unavailable to the plant.

Fertilizer Application
Some varieties can take high doses of nutri¬
ents, and other strains grow best with a mini¬
mum of supplemental fertilizer. See the chart
at left for recommendations on fertilizing a
few varieties. Many fertilizer programs are aug¬
mented with different additives that expedite
nutrient uptake.

To get an idea of which strains need a little
or a lot of fertilizer, I asked Alan from Sensi
Seeds and Henk from Dutch Passion for their
thoughts. To learn the exact best way to fer¬
tilize specific strains, you may need to con¬
tact the company that sold you the seeds.
Start with an EC of 1.6 and build it up as
needed. The absolute maximum EC is 2.3.
Strains which require high doses of fertilizer:
All the Indicas, with the possible excep¬
tion of 'Hindu Kush' (a landrace, with less
vigor and not as nutrient-hungry as hybrid
Indicas). In this case, 'more fertilizer means
using the high end of the recommended
dosage, not exceeding it.
'Twilight', 'Green Spirit', 'Khola', 'Hollands
Hope', 'Passion#T, 'Shaman' within an EC
range of 1.6-2.3

Determine if the plants need to be fertilized:
make a visual inspection, take an N-P-K soil test,
or experiment on test plants. No matter which
method is used, remember, plants in small con¬
tainers use available nutrients quickly and need
frequent fertilizing, while plants in large planters
have more soil, supply more nutrients, and can
go longer between fertilizing.
Visual Inspection - If the plants are growing
well and have deep-green, healthy leaves, they
are probably getting all necessary nutrients. The
moment growth slows or the leaves begin to
turn pale green, it is time to fertilize. Do not con¬
fuse yellow leaves caused by a lack of light with
yellow leaves caused by a nutrient deficiency.

Strains which require medium doses of
fertilizer:
'Skunk#!', 'Trance', 'Voodoo', 'Sacra Frasca',
'Cal. Orange', 'Delta 9', 'Skunk Passion',
'Blueberry', 'Durban Poison', 'Purple# 1',
'Purple Star', 'Skunk# 1', 'Super Haze', 'Ultra
Skunk', 'Orange Bud', 'White Widow', 'Power
'Plant', and 'Euforia' within an EC range of
1.6-2.3

Always use an accurate measuring container.

Strains which require low doses of fertilizer:
All the Sativa hybrids, with the exceptions
of 'Silver Pearl', 'Marley's Collie' and 'Fruity
Juice' (Sativa hybrids, but with a heavy,
Indica-dominant bud pattern). In this case,
less fertilizer means using the low end of
the recommended dosage. 'Northern Lights
#5 x Haze' has more open buds in growth
pattern, but a lot of floral bulk by weight, so
may need normal to slightly higher levels of
nutrient.
'Isis', 'Flo', 'Dolce Vita', 'Dreamweaver',
'Masterkush', 'Oasis', 'Skywalker' and
'Hempstar' within an EC range of 1.6-2.3.
Mazar needs a higher EC during weeks 3 to
5 to prevent early yellowing of the leaves.

Pale green leaves signify this plant is low on
nitrogen and needs to be fed with an all purpose
fertilizer.

General Hydroponics gives growers specific fertilizer and additive instructions for their products.
Taking an N-P-K soil test will reveal exactly
how much of each major nutrient is available
to the plant. The test kits mix a soil sample with
a chemical. After the soil settles, a color read¬
ing is taken from the liquid and matched to a
color chart. The appropriate percent of fertilizer
is then added. This method is exact but more
trouble than it is worth.
Experimenting on two or three test plants is
the best way to gain experience and develop
horticultural skills. Clones are perfect for this
type of experiment. Give the test plants some
fertilizer, and see if they green up and grow
faster. You should notice a change within three
to four days. If it is good for one, it should be
good for all.
Now, it has been determined that the plants
need fertilizer. How much? The answer is sim¬
ple. Mix the fertilizer as per the instructions and
water as normal, or dilute the fertilizer and apply
it more often. Many liquid fertilizers are very
diluted already. Consider using more concen¬
trated fertilizers whenever possible. Remember,

small plants use much less fertilizer than large
ones. Fertilize early in the day, so plants have all
day to absorb and process the fertilizer.
It is difficult to explain how often to apply all
fertilizers in a few sentences. We know that
large plants use more nutrients than small
plants. The more often the fertilizer is applied,
the less concentrated it should be. Frequency
of fertilization and dosage are two of the most
widely disagreed upon subjects among growers.
Indoor containerized marijuana can be pushed
to incredible lengths. Some strains will absorb
amazing amounts of fertilizer and grow well.
Lots of growers add as much as one tablespoon
per gallon (15 ml per 4 L) of Peters™ (20-2020) with each watering. This works best with
growing mediums that drain readily and are
easy to leach. Other growers use only rich,
organic potting soil. No supplemental fertilizer is
applied until a super bloom formula is needed
for flowering.
Fertilizing plants in the ground is much easier
than fertilizing containerized plants. In the soil

ing a liquid fertilizer solution on the foliage. The
method you choose will depend upon the kind
of fertilizer, the needs of the plants, and the
convenience of a chosen method.
When using synthetic fertilizers, it is extremely
important to read the label carefully, and follow
the directions. The initials "WSN" and "WIN" that
you may see on the label stand for water-soluble
nitrogen and water-insoluble nitrogen. WSN dis¬
solves readily, and it is considered a fast-release
nitrogen source. WIN does not dissolve easily. It
is often an organic form of nitrogen and is con¬
sidered a slow-release nitrogen source.
Use a siphon applicator-found at most nurseries-to mix soluble fertilizers with water. The
applicator is simply attached to the faucet with
the siphon submerged in the concentrated
fertilizer solution with the hose attached to the
other end. Often, applicators are set at a ratio of
1 to 15. This means that for every 1 unit of liquid
concentrate fertilizer, 15 units of water will be
mixed with it. Sufficient water flow is necessary
for the suction to work properly. Misting nozzles
restrict this flow. When the water is turned on,
the fertilizer is siphoned into the system and
flows out the hose. The fertilizer is generally
applied with each watering, since a small per¬
centage of fertilizer is metered in.

attached at the bottom that is set 3-4 feet (90120 cm) off the floor will act as a gravity-flow
source for the fertilizer solution. The container is
filled with water and fertilizer.
When it comes to fertilization, experience with
specific varieties and growing systems will tell
growers more than anything else. There are
hundreds of N-P-K mixes, and they all work!
When choosing a fertilizer, make sure to read
the entire label, and know what the fertilizer
claims it can do. Do not be afraid to ask the
retail clerk questions or to contact the manufac¬
turer with questions.
Once you have an idea of how often to
fertilize, put the garden on a regular feeding
schedule. A schedule usually works very well,
but it must be combined with a vigilant, caring
eye that looks for over-fertilization and signs of
nutrient deficiency.

Young ieaves are more permeable than older
leaves. Nutrients and additives penetrate immature
leaves faster than tougher, older leaves, and they
are easier to damage with strong sprays.
Foliar feed the cannabis plants only when specific
deficiency symptoms manifest. Foliar feeding is a
quick fix only and is easy to overdo. High levels of
nutrients in the foliage stop the roots from taking
in more; this is confusing for the plant. Foliar sprays
can accumulate and build up in the foliage. Never
spray more than once every 10 days, and keep the
spray concentration to less than 500 ppm or with
an EC of less than 1.0.
274

Spreader-Stickers
Smart growers use a surfactant, surface-active
substance (adjuvant), which enhances the effec¬
tiveness of foliar fertilization.
Spreaders (wetting agents) reduce the surface
tension of sprays and keep them from beading
up and rolling off the foliage. Big, bulbous drops
on the leaves mean you need to use a spreader.
Flat drops that slide off the foliage mean there
is too much spreader. There are nonionic,
antionic, and cationic spreaders. The nonionic
spreaders that do not ionize in water are the
most common, and they do not react with most
pesticides. Antionic and cationic spreaders are
not used often.
Stickers help the spray adhere to the leaf after
spraying, so it does not wash off when it rains
or when dew forms. Stickers not only increase
adhesion, they slow evaporation, and impart a
waterproof coating. Some stickers are spreaders,
too. Spreader-stickers allow the stomata on the
leaves to be penetrated.
Extender (stabilizing agents) protects applied
sprays against the UV radiation and heat that
degrade the sprays.
Liquid and powder soaps and detergents act as
surfactants, too. But, they are not nearly as effec¬
tive as horticultural surfactants. Biodegradable
surfactants disappear the fastest. Silicone sur¬
factants are also mild insecticides that work to
impair pest functions.
Foliar spray concentration is cumulative.
Nutrients delivered via the foliage can cause a
buildup of .salts in and around the leaves. This
is similar to the way the salts accumulate in
the soil.
Overfertilizing can become one of the biggest
problems for indoor growers. Too much fertilizer
causes a buildup of the nutrients (salts) to toxic
levels, and it changes the soil chemistry. When
overfertilized, growth is rapid and lush until the
toxic levels are reached. At this point, things
become complicated.
Chance of overfertilization is greater in a
small amount of soil that can hold only a small
amount of nutrients. A large pot or planter
can safely hold much more soil and nutrients,
but it will take longer to flush if overdone. It is
very easy to add too much fertilizer to a small
container. Large containers have good nutrient¬
holding ability.

Chapter ELEVEN

WATER & NUTRIENTS

To treat severely overfertilized plants, leach
the soil with two gallons (8 L) of diluted nutri¬
ent solution per gallon (4 L) of soil to wash
out all excess nutrients. The plant should start
new growth and look better in one week. If the
problem is severe and the leaves are curled, the
soil may need to be leached several times. After
the plant appears to have leveled off to normal
growth, apply the diluted fertilizer solution.

were developed for organic growers. Many of
these additives do what they say they will do
and work quickly; however, when growing a
short eight- to ten-week crop, some of these
additives do not have time to work properly if
added near the end of the flowering cycle.
The following list will give you an idea of what
specific additives are and how they are used.

Additives

Abscisic acid (ABA)

Numerous additives or growth supplements
have hit the market over the last few years.
Generally, additives contain a cocktail of some
of the elements listed below. Most of the addi¬

scales which cover the meristem, protecting it
from cold damage or dehydration. In case of an
early spring, ABA will also prolong dormancy,
preventing premature sprouts which could be
damaged by frost.
Used in the garden, ABA may help plants
resist drought and unseasonable conditions
and improve productivity, strength, and perfor¬
mance.

Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C)
Vitamin C is thought to build tighter, heavier
buds and act as an antioxidant. It is often
combined with fructose, molasses, or sugar
and added to the nutrient solution during the
last two weeks before harvest. However, some
botanists believe that although vitamin C is very
important in fighting the free radical byproducts
of photosynthesis, plants make their own vita¬
min C and are unlikely to recognize any benefit
from its addition to the nutrient mix.

Aspirin
Salicylic acid is a naturally occurring plant
hormone associated with the Willow. It is
effective in preventing pathogens by speeding
up the natural "systemic acquired resistance
(SAR)" thereby reducing the need for pesticides.
Salicylic acid (SA) will block abscisic acid (ABA)
allowing the plant to return to normal after a
period of stress-something to consider if ABA is
being used to strengthen plants.
Aspirin can be used as a spray, a soak, or
added to compost and rooting compounds. A
1:10,000 solution used as a spray will stimulate

Auxins represent a group of plant hormones
that regulate growth and phototropism. They are
associated with elongation of plant cells causing
the branches to grow vertically while inhibiting
lateral buds. "Pinching off" branch tips will reduce
the auxin level and encourage bushy lateral
growth as well as inducing new root formation.
Synthetic auxins are more stable and last longer
than the natural solutions. They can be used as
an herbicide against broadleaf weeds like dande¬
lions, but are most often used to encourage root
growth and promote flowering.

Bacteria
Bacteria such as mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobacteria are extremely beneficial in organic gar¬
dening. The presence of these organisms in the
growing medium produces stronger, healthier
plants that require less chemical intervention.
Actino-lron is a commercial soil additive that
contains the Streptomyces lydicus microbe.
Applied to the soil, the bacterium grows around
the root system, protecting it from harmful
pathogens while producing anti-fungals. Actinolron also contains fulvic acid and iron which
feed the plant. For perennials, the effects last
one growing season. For annuals, the life of
the plant.

B-9 folic acid
There is little literature on the effects of B-9
on plants, it appears to serve in energy transfer
within the plant and inhibits the enzyme that
makes gibberellic acid resulting in a bushier
dwarf-type plant without pruning.
B-9 can be applied as a spray or as a soil
drench.

Cellulase
Cellulase is a group of enzymes that act in the
root zone to break down organic material which
may rot and cause disease. Dead materials are
converted into glucose and returned to the sub¬
strate to be absorbed by the plant.
It can be used in water gardens to clean up

Chapter ELEVEN

organic sludge.

Colchicine
Colchicine, an alkaloid, is prepared from the
dried corns and seeds of Colchicum outumnale,
the autumn crocus that also produces saffron.
The pale, yellow powder is water soluble.
Colchicine is a very dangerous, poisonous
compound that can be used to induce polyploid
mutations in cannabis. Clandestine breeders
started polyploid strains with colchicines, but
none of the strains showed any outstanding
characteristics, and cannabinoid levels were
unaffected.
Rather than explain how to use colchicine, I
will advise not to use it. It is very toxic and pro¬
duces no change in potency. I do not know any
seed breeders that use it today.

Cytokinins
Cytokinins are plant hormones derivative of
the purine adenine, the most common cytokinin
being Zeatin. They are synthesized in the roots
promoting cell division, chloroplast develop¬
ment, leaf development, and leaf senescence.
As an additive, cytokinins are most often derived
from the Seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum.
Added to the soil or sprayed on the plants,
cytokinins help the plant make more efficient
use of existing nutrients and water even in
drought conditions. The result is a healthier
plant and increased crop. Care must be given to
application of cytokinins along with other plant
hormones. Many commercial formulas contain
a hormone cocktail which includes hormones
like auxins and cytokinins that work against one
another.

Enzymes
Enzymes are biological protein catalysts that
were first crystallized and isolated in 1926.
Enzymes accelerate the rates of reactions but do
not change themselves as a result of this action.
Enzymes are added to fertilizers and growth
additives to accelerate biological activity and
speed nutrient uptake by roots.
Most enzymatic reactions happen within a
temperature range of 85-105°F (30-40°C) and
each enzyme has an optimal range of pH for

activity. Most enzymes react with only a small
group of chemical compounds that are closely
related.
More than 1500 different enzymes have been
identified. Enzymes are grouped into six main
classes and many subclasses.

Ethylene gas
Ethylene gas is a growth regulator hormone
that activates the aging and ripening of flowers
as well as preventing the development of buds
and retarding plant growth. It is most often used
by vegetable growers who force ripening of pro¬
duce heading to market. In gardening, it may be
used to trigger flowering in plants.

Flower saver plus
Flower Saver Plus is a commercial product that
contains the Mycorrhizae fungus which enters
into a symbiotic relationship with the plant by
attaching itself to the root system. Mycorrhizal
threads enter into root tissue then grow out into
the substrate reaching more water and nutrients
than the plant could find on its own. In return,
the Mycorrhizae receive a protected environ¬
ment and the sugars they need to thrive.
Use of Mycorrhizae improves root depth,
speeds maturation, and helps create resistance
to drought and disease. Larger more robust root
systems also improve the soil structure promot¬
ing better air and water movement.
Flower Saver Plus should be used at planting

time either as a root bath or worked into the top
two to four inches of soil. Look for a product that
has at least 50 to 100 spores per square foot
Seek medical attention if ingested. Avoid
breathing the dust or spray, and keep out of
reach of children.

Fulvic acid
Fulvic acid is a naturally occurring organic
substance resulting from the microbial action
on decomposing plants. Absorbed into a plant,
fulvic acid will remain in the tissues and serve as
a powerful antioxidant as well as providing nutri¬
ents and acting as a bio-stimulant. Fulvic acid is
an excellent source of nutrition for Mycorrhizae.
Growers can create fulvic acid by composting
or purchase the product from a retailer. It is
available in forms suitable for hydroponics or
soil mediums.

Gibberellins
Gibberellic Acid (GA) is a natural plant growth
hormone which acts with auxins to break dor¬
mancy, stimulate seed germination, and grow
long stems.
Gibberellic Acid can be purchased as a com¬
mercial product like Mega-Grow and is used to
extend the grow season and force larger blooms.
For best effect, use GA in complement with fer¬
tilizer and mixed into the water supply. Results
can be seen in as little as a few weeks.
According to the Material Safety Data Sheet
(MSDS), GA is very hazardous to humans, and I
do not advise using it; however, the retail adver¬
tisements claim the product is safe.

Humic add
Humic acids are carbons formed by the decom¬
position of organic substances, primarily that of
vegetation. Applied to substrate, it encourages
the creation of strong tissue growth and helps
in nutrient transport. Plants grow thicker foliage
and are more resistant to drought and disease.
Poor soils can be improved by humic acid
which enhances the water-holding capability
and aeration in sandy soils and frees up nutri¬
ents bound in clay. It can be used as a root dip
or sprayed directly onto the soil.
Humic acids are extracted from humic sub¬

stances found in soil. Colors range from yellow
(fulvic acid) to brown (humic acid) and black
(humin).
Fulvic acid is the fraction of humic substances
that is water soluble under all pH conditions.
Fulvic acid stays in solution after humic acid dis¬
sipates due to acidification.
Humin is the fraction of the soil organic matter
that is not dissolved when the soil is treated with
dilute alkali.

Hydrogen peroxide
Hydrogen peroxide (H202) is similar to water
but carries an extra, unstable, oxygen molecule
which can break down into a reactive atom and
either attach itself to another oxygen atom or
attack an organic molecule.
Used in horticulture, hydrogen peroxide pro¬
vides a host of benefits by cleansing water of
harmful substances such as spores, dead organic
material, and disease-causing organisms while
preventing new infections from occurring. It
removes the methane and organic sulfates often
found in well water as well as removing chlorine
from tap water.
Hydrogen peroxide is especially useful in hydro¬
ponics, where overwatering can be a problem. It
prevents oxygen depletion in the water around
the roots, leading to better root growth. A solu¬
tion of hydrogen peroxide can be used to steril¬
ize seeds resulting in better germination rates.
Hydrogen peroxide is dangerous at high con¬
centrations (35%) and will damage skin, cloth¬
ing, and most anything it contacts. Lower con¬
centrations like those found at the drug store
(3%) will still need to be diluted before use,
though they are not as toxic to the gardener.

Indole 3 butyric acid (IBA)
Indole 3 butyric acid is one of the auxin growth
hormones. It is most often used as an effec¬
tive rooting hormone. Application of I BA helps
generate roots, build a larger root mass, and
improve plant growth and yield.
Many commercial formulas are available in
the form of water-solubie salts. Cuttings can
be dipped or immersed before planting. Roots
can be dipped or sprayed or the soil drenched
during transplanting. Once established, plants

Chapter ELEVEN
should be treated at three- to five-week inter¬
vals during the growing season. After harvest,
IBA can be used to encourage regeneration of
flowers.
IBA is hazardous to humans and animals. It
can cause moderate eye injury and is harmful if
inhaled or absorbed through the skin.

Isopentyl adenine (IPA)
Isopentyl adenine is a naturally occurring cytokinin which is synthetically manufactured as
benzylaminopurine (BAP) for use in commercial
bio-stimulants such as Rush Foliar XCell Veg and
Xcell Bloom.
Xcell Veg acts in the growth stage of the plant
by improving the transport of nutrients. Glycine
betaine in the solution provides a barrier to
environmental stress. The product is used as
part of an established feeding program. It can be
sprayed on, just before turning off the lights, or
used as a soak in the growing medium.
Xceli Bloom also has anti-stress properties and
improves nutrient transport. It stimulates flower¬
ing, reduces plant growth time, and increases
cell division and lateral root growth. Flowers are
larger, heavier, and have enhanced color.
Both products can be used in hydroponic or
soil mediums.

Rhizobium
Rhizobium is the name given to a group of
bacteria which infect the roots of legumes and
create nodules that act in symbiosis with the
plant. Rhizobia are host-specific and will not
work with all crops. With the proper host, how¬
ever, Rhizobia improve nitrogen fixation while
simultaneously providing an additional source
of nitrogen.
Rhizobium is most effective when added to
irrigation, but it can be added to a drip or directly
to the soil. Benefits will depend on proper
crop/Rhizobium match. Re-inoculation is recom¬
mended every three to five years.

Spray-n-grow
Spray-N-Grow is a brand name vitamin and
nutrient solution that includes barium and zinc.
It is sprayed on plants to provide micronutrients
through the foliage, a technique said to be more

WATER & NUTRIENTS
effective than root nutrition. Plants will grow
faster, bloom earlier and more prolifically, have
larger roots, and have a higher vitamin, mineral,
and sugar content.
Because it is absorbed through the leaves,
Spray-N-Grow works quickly, in as little as seven
to thirty days. Tender plants will realize benefits
faster than woody plants. Spray-N-Grow can be
used in any type of growing medium as a com¬
plement to the established feeding regimen. It is
non-chemical and safe for people and pets.

Sugar
Molasses, honey, and other sugars are said to
increase soil microbials, enhance regrowth, and
make the plant's use of nitrogen more effective.
Molasses will raise the energy level of the plant
and acts as a mild natural fungicide. Molasses
is the "secret ingredient" in many organic
fertilizers.

Trichoderma (002/003)
Trichoderma are fungi that colonize in the root
zone, crowding out negative fungi and micro¬
organisms while stimulating root development
and resistance to environmental stress. The result
is a more vibrant, stronger plant.
Canna was the first company in the indoor grow
industry to sell a commercial product as a growthpromoter which contains Trichoderma fungi.
Colorado State University studies indicate that
Promot Plus, a product containing Trichoderma,
is effective in suppressing pathogenic fungi that
cause rot in the seeds, roots, and stems.
The product can be applied to seeds, used during
transplanting, mixed with liquid fertilizer or via drip
irrigation and/or watered in. Canna's Trichoderma
contains living organisms that will reproduce after
application, so a small amount will do a lot. It is
nontoxic and environmentally safe.

Zeatin
Zeatin is one of the cytokinin growth hor¬
mones. Upon germination, zeatin moves from
the endosperm to the root tip where it stimu¬
lates mitosis.

have no moving parts. Seldom does anything break

Active hydroponic systems "actively" move the
nutrient solution. Examples of active systems are:
flood and drain, and top feed. Cannabis is a fast¬
growing plant and very well suited to active hydro¬
ponic systems.
Active hydroponic gardens are considered a
"recovery" system if the nutrient solution is recov¬
ered and reused after irrigation. A "non-recovery"
system applies the nutrient solution once, then it
runs to waste. The solution is not reused. Non¬
recovery systems have few complications but
are not practical for most cannabis hydroponic
gardens. The commercial growers "run-to-waste"
systems are avoided, because they pollute ground
water with high levels of nitrates, phosphates, and
other elements. Indoor growers seldom use non¬
recovery systems, because they require disposing
of so much nutrient solution into the local sewer
system.

to manage. Active recovery systems use growing mediums
that drain rapidly and hold plenty of air, including: expanded

is a growing bed that can hold one to four inches (3-10 cm)
of nutrient solution. Nutrient solution is pumped into the
table or growing bed. The rockwool blocks or containers are
flooded from the bottom, which pushes the oxygen-poor air
out. Once the nutrient solution reaches a set level, an over¬
flow pipe drains the excess to the reservoir. When the pump
is turned off and the growing medium drains, it draws new

oxygen-rich air into contact with the roots. A maze of drainage
gullies in the bottom of the table directs runoff solution back
to the catchment tank or reservoir. This cycle is repeated sev¬
eral times a day. Ebb and flow systems are ideal for growing
many short plants in a Sea of Green garden.

Nutrient solution floods the growing bed and drains back
into a reservoir in an ebb and flow garden.

Self-leveling legs, similar to those of a
washing machine, support this ebb and
flow garden bed and ensure all plants
receive a level dose of nutrient solution
and that it all drains back into the
reservoir below.

Flood the table to half to three-quarters the height
of the container to ensure even nutrient solution dis¬
tribution. Avoid lightweight mediums such as perlite
that may cause containers to float and fall over.
A large volume of water is necessary to fill the
entire table. Make sure the reservoir has enough
solution to flood the reservoir and still retain a mini¬
mum of 25 percent extra to allow for daily evapora¬
tion. Replenish reservoir daily if necessary. Do not let
nutrient solution stand in the table for more than a
half hour. Submerged roots drown in the depleted
oxygen environment.
Flood the table when the medium is about half¬
full of moisture. Remember, rockwool holds a lot
of moisture. Irrigation regimens will need to change
substantially when temperatures cool and light is
lacking.

to let excess water flow freely away from the grow¬

ating principle is simple, effective, and nearly fail¬
safe. The nutrient solution is forced up to the grow¬
ing bed with air pressure generated by an external
air pump. The pump can run on ordinary house¬
hold electrical current or a solar-powered 12-volt
system. Once flooded, the nutrient solution stays in
the growing bed for a few minutes before it drains
back to the reservoir. Constant air pressure during
flooding also aerates the growing medium. The
sealed, airtight reservoir limits evaporation, which
in turn prevents algae growth and keeps the nutri¬
ent fresh. The external pump reduces the overall
cost of the system and helps prevent electrical acci¬
dents. You can use rockwool, coco coir, peat, or a
composite growing medium with excellent results.

Deep Water Culture (DWC)
Crowing in deep water culture (DWC) is simple,
easy, and productive.
If growing outdoors in a DWC garden, a simple
overflow drainage hole can be cut in the side of
the reservoir to prevent rainwater from causing it
to overflow.
Seedlings and clones are held in net pots full of
expanded clay pellets, rockwool or other growing
medium. The net pots are nestled in holes in a lid
that covers the reservoir. The roots of seedlings
and cuttings dangle down into the nutrient solu¬
tion. A submersible pump lifts nutrient solution to
the top of a discharge tube where it splashes into

wetting roots and splashing into the self-contained
reservoir below, which in turn increases dissolved
oxygen in the solution. Roots easily absorb nutri¬
ents and water from the solution in the oxygenated
environment. Many gardens also keep an air stone
bubbling new air into the reservoir to supply more
oxygen.
These gardens are simple by design and require
no timer, because the pumps are on 24 hours a
day. This low-maintenance garden is perfect for
casual gardeners as well as hydroponic enthusi¬
asts.

Top-Feed Systems
Top-feed hydroponic systems are very produc¬
tive, easy to control, precise, easy to maintain, and
efficient. The nutrient solution is metered out in
specific doses and delivered via spaghetti tubing or
an emitter placed at the base of individual plants.
Aerated nutrient solution flows into the grow¬
ing medium and is taken up by roots. The runoff
nutrient solution is directed back to the reservoir
as soon as it drains from the growing medium.
Rockwool, gravel, coconut coir, and expanded clay
are the most common growing mediums found

in top-feed systems. Versatile top-feed systems
can be used with individual containers or slabs in
individual beds or lined up on tables.
Top-feed systems come in many configurations.
Systems with several gallons of growing medium
are best for growing large plants that may require
support. Small containers are perfect for smaller
plants.

Top-Feed Buckets
Self-contained top-feed buckets consist of a
growing container nested inside a reservoir con¬
taining a pump. Individual buckets make culling
out and replacing a sick plant quick and easy. Selfcontained top-feed bucket systems are also perfect
for growing large mother plants. The container
can be moved anywhere easily. Some containers
have a net pot suspended in the lid of a five-gallon
(19 L) bucket/reservoir. The roots hang down into
the reservoir. An air stone in the bottom of the
reservoir aerates the nutrient solution. A separate
pump cycles the irrigation to the container. Other
self-contained top-feed buckets use a large grow¬
ing container filled with expanded clay pellets. A
pump constantly cycles nutrient solution in the sys¬
tem, aerating the solution and irrigating the plant.
Roots grow down into the nutrient solution to
form a mass on the bottom. Irrigation from the top
circulates aerated nutrient solution and flushes out
old oxygen-poor solution. Some systems contain a
one-inch (3 cm) pipe to draw air directly down to
the root zone. There are many different variations
of this system, and they all work!

The grower plants three well-rooted cuttings in
each container.
Other top-feed bucket systems employ multiple

buckets that are connected to a main reservoir.
A flexible drain hose is attached near the bottom
of the bucket/reservoir. The hose is connected to
a drainage manifold that shuttles runoff nutrient
solution back to a central reservoir.
Each reservoir below the growing container holds
an inch or two of water. It is important to regularly
cycle irrigation in these gardens, so the solution in
the bottom of the buckets does not stagnate.
Top-feed buckets can also be lined up on a
drainage table. Square containers make most
efficient use of space. Plants are fed with irrigation
tubing attached to a manifold. Once delivered, the
nutrient solution flows and percolates through the
growing medium. Roots take in the aerated nutri¬
ent solution before it drains onto the tray and back
to the reservoir.

Individual containers in top-feed bucket systems
are easy to arrange to fit into the allotted garden
space. Plants can also be transplanted or removed
from pots and cared for individually.

Top-Feed Slabs
Top-feed

slab systems are

popular among

small and large indoor and greenhouse growers.
Rockwool or coco slabs covered in plastic serve as
growing containers. The nutrient solution is deliv¬
ered via spaghetti tubes from the top of the slab.
An emitter attached to the spaghetti tube doses a
specific measure of nutrient solution to each plant.
The nutrient solution is aerated as it is applied,
before being absorbed by the growing medium
and draining back to the reservoir.
A simple nutrient solution delivery manifold
consists of emitters connected to spaghetti delivery
tubes. The tubes are attached to a short manifold
that is fed by a pump submerged in a reservoir.
Emitters are designed to be anchored in growing
medium and to emit a measured dose of nutrient

solution.
Some systems use individual trays to contain
slabs. Nutrient solution is pumped from the res¬
ervoir and delivered to plants via spaghetti tubes
attached to emitters. Individual trays are easy to
configure for different sized gardens.

Tables of Slabs
You can also set up a drainage table and place
slabs on top. The nutrient solution is pumped
from the reservoir below the table and delivered
to individual plants via spaghetti tubes attached
to emitters. The solution flows into the growing
medium where it comes into contact with roots.
Excess nutrient solution drains from pots onto the
table and is carried back to the reservoir. Make sure
the table is set up on an incline so it drains evenly.
Pockets of standing water on the table contain less
oxygen and promote rot.

Individual Blocks
This cutaway of a top-feed bucket system shows
how roots dangle in a 100 percent humid
environment before growing into the nutrient
solution. Remember to screen the drain in the
reservoir so roots do not block it.

Individual blocks in this rockwool system allow

Vertical Top-Feed Systems
Vertical gardens can increase overall yield more
than ten-fold over a flat garden. Substrate bags,
tubes, or slabs are positioned vertically around
an HID. Short plants are placed in the medium
and fed individually with a drip emitter. The runoff
drains through the growing medium and back to
the reservoir. The solution is re-circulated once it

The slope of the gulley is adequate to prevent

prevent debris from blocking gullies and pump.
Although high performance, NFT systems offer
practically no buffering ability. In the absence
of a growing medium, roots must be kept per¬

from the top of the system.
Aeroponic systems require greater attention to
detail. There is no growing medium to act as a
water/nutrient bank, which makes the system
delicate and touchy to use. If the pump fails,
roots soon dry, and plants suffer. Systems that use
delicate spray nozzles must be kept free of debris.
Imbalanced nutrient solution and pH can also
cause problems quickly. This is why it is important
to purchase quality components or a ready-made
system from a qualified supplier.
The RainForest (www.generalhydroponics.com) is

Growing Mediums
Soilless growing mediums provide support for
the root system, as well as hold and make avail¬
able oxygen, water, and nutrients. Three factors
contribute to cannabis roots' ability to grow in a
substrate: texture, pH, and nutrient content, which
is measured in EC, electrical conductivity.
The texture of any substrate is governed by the
size and physical structure of the particles that
constitute it. Proper texture promotes strong root
penetration, oxygen retention, nutrient uptake,
and drainage. Growing mediums that consist of

Long root systems develop quickly on cuttings in
this Rain Forest aeroponic system.

large particles permit good aeration and drainage.
Increased irrigation frequency is necessary to com¬
pensate for low water retention. Water- and air¬
holding ability and root penetration are a function
of texture. The smaller the particles, the closer they
pack together and the slower they drain. Larger
particles drain faster and retain more air.
Irregular shaped substrates such as perlite and
some expanded clays have more surface area and
hold more water than round soilless mediums.

Rooted clones and seedlings grown in aeroponic
systems develop exceptionally fast. To grow
clones, simply insert clone stems into the growth
chamber and turn it on. The roots will grow in a
perfect environment to develop roots.

Avoid crushed gravel with sharp edges that cut into
roots if the plant falls or is jostled around. Round

react with living organisms or chemicals to change
the integrity of the nutrient solution. Coconut coir
and peat mosses are also inert.
Non-inert growing mediums cause unforeseen
problems. For example, gravel from a limestone
quarry is full of calcium carbonate, and old con¬
crete is full of lime. When mixed with water,
calcium carbonate will raise the pH, and it is very
difficult to make it go down. Growing mediums
made from reconstituted concrete bleed out so
much lime, they soon kill the garden.
Avoid substrates found within a few miles of the
ocean or large bodies of salt water. Most likely,
such mediums are packed with toxic salts. Rather
than washing and leaching salts from the medium,
it is easier and more economical to find another
source of substrate.

Expanded clay, also called hydroclay, or hydro¬

The clay pellets are cooked at high temperatures
in a kiln until they expand. Many little catacomb¬

Foam is somewhat popular. It lasts a long time, lends itself
to easy sterilization, and holds a lot of water and air.

Gravel is one of the original hydroponic mediums. Although
heavy, gravel is inert, holds plenty of air, drains well, and is
inexpensive. Still popular today, gravel is difficult to over¬
water. It holds moisture, nutrient, and oxygen on its outer
surfaces. Use pea gravel or washed river gravel with round
edges that do not cut roots when jostled about. Gravel should
be 0.125-0.375-inches (3-10 mm) in diameter, with more
than half of the medium about 0.25-inch (6 mm) across.
Pumice is a good growing medium. It
can also be used as mulch or as an
inert soil amendment.

Crushed rock can be packed with many salts. Pre-soak and
adjust its pH before use. Gravel has low water retention and
low buffering ability.

Pumice is a naturally occurring, porous, lightweight, volcanic
rock that holds moisture and air in catacomb-like surfaces.
Light and easy to work with, some lava rock is so light it floats.
Be careful that sharp edges on the rocks do not damage
roots. Lava rock is still a good medium and acts similarly to
expanded clay. See "Pumice" under "Soil Amendments."

fewer pest and disease problems, and decrease
incidence of clogged feeder tubes.
Substrate can also be washed in a large con¬
tainer such as a barrel or bathtub. Washing works
best with lighter substrates such as expanded clay
or mica. Roots float to the top and are readily
skimmed off with a screen or by hand.
Once roots are removed, soak the substrate in
a sterilant such as a five percent laundry bleach
(calcium or sodium hypochlorite) solution for at
least an hour. Or mix hydrochloric acid, the kind
used in hot tubs and swimming pools. Pour, drain,
or pump off the sterilant, and flush the medium
with plenty of fresh water. A bathtub and a shower
nozzle on a hose are perfect for washing substrate.
Place the substrate in the bathtub, set a screen
over the drain, and use the showerhead or a hose
to wash down the medium. It may be necessary to
fill the tub with fresh water and drain it a couple
of times to rinse any residual sterilants from the
substrate.
Remove harvested plant root balls from the
growing medium, and remove roots and stems.

If you decide to use rockwool or coco a second
time, you may have problems with pests and dis¬
eases. In general, I recommend reusing a medium
only if it does not deteriorate or compact. Examples
include: pea gravel, expanded clay, lava rock, sand,
etc. Once used indoors, reuse rockwool and biode¬
gradable coco in the outdoor garden.
To sterilize a hydroponic garden, remove the
nutrient solution from the reservoir. Pump the
solution into the outdoor garden. Avoid pumping
it down household drains, and definitely do not
pump it into a septic tank. The nutrients will disrupt
the chemistry!
Flood the growing medium with the sterilizing
solution for at least one-half hour, let drain, and
flush again. Pump the bleach solution out of the
system and down the drain. Do not dump steril¬
ants outdoors; they will defoliate plants where they
are dumped. Use lots of fresh water to leach and

and more available than when in soil. The
pH of the solution can fluctuate a half point
and not cause any problems.
Roots take in nutrients at different rates,
which causes the ratios of nutrients in
solution to change the pH. When the pH is
above 7 or below 5.5, some nutrients are
not absorbed as fast as possible. Check the
pH every day or two to make sure it is at or
near the perfect level.
Deviations in pH levels often affect ele¬
ment solubility. Values change slightly with
different plants, grow mediums, and hydro-

This controller monitors and controls the pH in the
reservoir by dispersing pH Up or pH Down. The separate

Follow manufacturer's guidelines for pH level, and
correct the pH using the manufacturer's suggested
chemicals, because they will react best with their
fertilizer.
The pH can easily fluctuate up and down one full
point in hydroponic systems and cause little or no
problem with nutrient uptake.
Follow the directions on the container, and
remember to mix adjusters into the reservoir slowly
and completely. Fertilizers are normally acidic and
lower the pH of the nutrient solution. But nutrient
solution is still taken in by plants, and water tran¬
spires and evaporates into the air, which causes
the pH to climb.
Stabilize the pH of the water before adding
fertilizer.
Make a correction if readings vary ± one-half

(EC and ppm) are not directly related. Each nutri¬

standard was implemented which assumes "a

Inexpensive meters last for about a year,
and expensive meters can last for many years.

Use calibrated EC meter to measure the samples.
Under normal conditions, the EC in the slab
should be a little higher than the nutrient solution
in the reservoir. If the EC of the solution drawn
from the growing medium is substantially higher
than the one from the reservoir, there is a salt
buildup in the substrate. Correct the imbalance
by flushing substrate thoroughly with diluted
nutrient solution, and replace with new solution.
Regularly check the EC of your water, slab, and
runoff.

Many of the same principles that apply to soil apply
to the hydroponic medium.

To remove roots and
sterilize the growing medium:
1. Manually remove the mat of roots that are
entwined near the bottom of the bed, and shake
loose any attached growing medium. It may be
easier to add more medium than to pick it from
between the matted roots
2. Pour growing mediums such as expanded clay
and gravel through a screen placed over a large
bucket. Most of the roots will stay on the screen.
3. Lay growing medium out on the floor, and train
an oscillating fan on it to dry out remaining roots.

When air is cooler than water, moisture rapidly
evaporates into the air; the greater the tempera¬

During and soon after irrigation, the nutrient content
of the bed and the reservoir are the same concentration.
As time passes between irrigations, the EC and the pH
gradually change. If enough time passes between irriga¬

that the plant is not able to draw it in.
There are many variations on how often to water. Experi¬

Nutrient Disorders
When the hydroponic garden is on a regular mainte¬

nutrient problems are usually averted. If nutrient defi¬

the irrigation fittings to ensure nutrient-challenged

nutrient solution is penetrating entire medium and all
roots are wet. Check the root zone to ensure roots have
not plugged drainage conduits and are not standing in

Change the nutrient solution if there is a good flow
of nutrient solution through the root zone, but plants
still appear sickly. Make sure the pH of the water is
within the acceptable 5.5-6.5 range before adding new
nutrients.
If changing solution does not solve the problem,
changing to a new brand of fertilizer may do the trick.

Introduction
Fresh air is essential in all gardens. Indoors, it
could be the difference between success and
failure. Outdoor air is abundant and packed
with carbon dioxide (C02) necessary for plant

life. For example, the level of C02 in the air over
a field of rapidly growing cannabis could be
only a third of normal on a very still day. Wind
blows in fresh C02-rich air. Rain washes air
and plants of dust and pollutants. The outdoor
environment is often harsh and unpredictable,
but there is always fresh air. Indoor gardens
must be meticulously controlled to replicate the
outdoor atmosphere.
Carbon dioxide and oxygen provide basic
building blocks for plant life. Oxygen is used for
respiration-burning carbohydrates and other
foods to provide energy. Carbon dioxide must
be present during photosynthesis. Without C02
a plant will die. Carbon dioxide combines light
energy with water to produce sugars. These
sugars fuel the growth and metabolism of the
plant. With reduced levels of C02, growth slows
to a crawl. Except during darkness, a plant
releases more oxygen than is used and uses
much more carbon dioxide than it releases.
Roots use air, too. Oxygen must be present
along with water and nutrients for the roots to
be able to absorb nutrients. Compacted, watersaturated soil leaves roots little or no air, and
nutrient uptake stalls.

Air Movement
Air ventilation and circulation are essential to a
healthy indoor harvest. Indoors, fresh air is one
of the most overlooked factors contributing to

air is the least expensive essential component
required to produce a bumper crop. Experienced
growers understand the importance of fresh air
and take the time to set up an adequate ventila¬
tion system. Three factors affect air movement:
stomata, ventilation, and circulation.

Stomata

Microscopic stomata located on leaf undersides must remain clean and

This garden has several circulation fans to move
air between dense, resinous buds.
Hot air flows upward naturally. Always design
grow rooms and greenhouses to take advantage
of this principle.

Floor-mounted oscillating fans stir the air in this
room 24 hours a day.

C02 around leaves is used quickly and must be
replaced every few minutes.

Place circulation fans far enough away from
plants to prevent too much airflow on any one
portion of the garden.

Here is an example of a heavy-duty extractor fan
from a Dutch grow room.

Ballasts are kept in the box which contains the
extra heat. Separate ducting carries out the hot
air.

A booster fan in the gray box pushes intake air
down the duct to the bottom of the garden.

This blower is at the end of intake air ducting.
The main fan is at the other end.

Avoid long, unnecessary ducting such as shown
above. Keep ducting as short as possible.

spiration increases, stomata function properly,
and growth rebounds. A vent fan that extracts
air from the grow room is the perfect solution
to femove this humid, stale air. Fresh air flows
in through an intake vent or with the help of an
intake fan.
Ventilation is as important as water, light,
heat, and fertilizer. In many cases, fresh air is
even more important. Greenhouses use large
ventilation fans. Grow rooms are very similar to
greenhouses and should follow their example.
Most grow rooms have an easy-to-use opening,
such as a window in which to mount a fan, but
security or room location may render it unus¬
able. If no vent opening is available, one will
have to be created.
All grow rooms require ventilation. This system
could be as simple as an open door or window
that supplies and circulates fresh air throughout
the room, but open doors and windows can be
inconvenient and problematic. Most growers

lubricated so they run smoothly and quietly.

Ventilation
Fresh air is easy to obtain and inexpensive
to maintain-it is as simple as hooking up and
placing the proper-sized exhaust fan in the most
efficient location. An intake vent may be neces¬
sary to create a flow of fresh air in the room.
A 10-foot square (0.92 m2) garden will use
from 10 to 50 gallons (38 to 190L) or more
of water every week. Plants transpire (similar
to evaporation) most of this water into the air.
Every day and night, rapidly growing plants
transpire more moisture into the air. If this
moisture is left in the grow room, humidity
increases to 100 percent, which stifles stomata
and causes growth to screech to a halt. It also
opens the door for pest and disease attacks.

Most often, the vent fan is attached to ducting
that directs air out of the grow room. Flexible
ducting is easier to use than rigid ducting. To
install, run the duct the shortest possible dis¬
tance, and keep curves to a minimum. When
turned at more than 30°, much of the air that
enters a duct will not exit the other end. Keep
the ducting straight and short.

Intake Air
Intake air ducting has holes covered with duct
tape. Air flow is directed by removing pieces of
tape.

Many rooms have enough fresh air coming in
via cracks and holes. But other grow rooms are
tightly sealed and require fresh air to be ushered
in with the help of an intake fan. An intake fan
is the same as an exhaust fan, except it blows
fresh air into the room. The ratio of 1 to 4 (100
CFM [m3/h] incoming and 400 CFM [m3/h]
outgoing) should give the room a little negative
pressure. Delivering fresh air to plants ensures
they will have adequate C02 to continue rapid
growth. One of the best ways to deliver air
directly to plants is to pipe it in via flexible duct¬
ing. Ingenious growers cut holes in the intake
ducting to direct air where it is needed. The air

is dispersed evenly throughout the room.
Always make sure fresh air is neither too hot
nor too cold. For example, one friend that lives
in a hot, arid climate brings cool fresh air in from
under the house, where the air is a few degrees
cooler than ambient air.

Security
When installing a vent fan, security concerns
dictate that no light or odor escape from the
exterior vent while allowing ample air release.
This can be accomplished in several ways. Baffle
or turn the light around a corner to subdue
brilliance. Many chimneys in British Columbia,

Greenhouse fans are equipped with louvers
(flaps or baffles) to prevent backdrafts. During
cold and hot weather, undesirable backdrafts
could alter the climate in the room and usher
in a menagerie of pests and diseases. Installing
a vent fan with louvers eliminates backdrafts,
but may present a security risk if it attracts the
attention of the wrong crowd.

proper, constant temperature in the grow room
promotes strong, even, healthy growth. Make
sure plants are not too close to a heat source,
like a ballast or heat vent, or they may dry out,
maybe even get heat scorch. Cold intake air will
also stunt plant growth.
Cannabis regulates its oxygen uptake in rela¬
tion to the ambient air temperature rather than
the amount of available oxygen. Plants use a
lot of oxygen; in fact, a plant cell uses as much
oxygen as a human cell. The air must contain
at least 20 percent oxygen for plants to thrive.
Leaves are not able to make oxygen at night,
but roots still need oxygen to grow. A plant's res¬
piration rate approximately doubles every 20°F

(10°C). Root respiration increases as the roots
warm up, which is why fresh air is important
both day and night.
Temperatures above 85°F (29°C) are not rec¬
ommended even when using C02 enrichment.
Under the proper conditions, which are very
demanding to maintain, higher temperatures
step up metabolic activity and speed growth.
The warmer it is, the more water the air is able
to hold. This moist air often restrains plant func¬
tions and decelerates growth rather than speed¬
ing it. Other complications and problems result
from excess humidity and moisture condensa¬
tion when the temperature drops at night.
Heat buildup during warm weather can catch
growers off guard and cause serious problems.
Ideal grow rooms are located underground, in
a basement, taking advantage of the insulating
qualities of Mother Earth. With the added heat
of the HID and hot, humid weather outdoors,
a room can heat up rapidly. More than a few
American growers have lost their crops to heat
stroke during the Fourth of July weekend, since
it is the first big holiday of the summer, and
everybody in the city wants to get away to
enjoy it. There are always some gardeners that
forget or are too paranoid to maintain good
ventilation in the grow room while on vacation.
Temperatures can easily climb to 100°F (38°C)
or more in grow rooms that are poorly insulated
and vented. The hotter it is, the more ventilation
and water that are necessary.
The cold of winter is the other temperature
extreme. Montreal, Quebec, Canada, growers
will remember the year of the big ice storm.
Electricity went out all over the city and sur¬
rounding areas. Water pipes froze, and heating
systems failed. Residents were driven from their
homes until electricity was restored some days
later. Many growers returned to find their beau¬
tiful gardens wilted, stricken with the deepest,
most disgusting green only a freeze can bring.
Broken water pipes, ice everywhere! It is diffi¬
cult to combat such acts of God, but if possible,
always keep the grow room above 50°F (10°C)
and definitely above freezing, 32°F (0°C). If the

temperature dips below this mark, the freeze
will rupture plant cells, and foliage will die back
or, at best, grow slowly. Growth slows/stops
when the temperature dips below 55°F (13°C).
Stressing plants with cold weather conditions is
not recommended; it may yield a proportion¬
ately higher THC content, but will reduce plants'
overall productivity.
A thermostat measures the temperature,
then controls it by turning on or off a device
that regulates heating or cooling, keeping the
temperature within a predetermined range. A
thermostat can be attached to an electric or
combustion heater. In fact, many homes are
already set up with electric baseboard heat and
a thermostat in each room.
A thermostat can be used to control cooling
vent fans in all but the coldest grow rooms.
When it gets too hot in a room, the thermostat
turns on the vent fan, which evacuates the
hot stale air. The vent fan remains on until
the desired temperature is reached, then the
thermostat turns off the fan. A thermostat-controlled vent fan offers adequate temperature
and humidity control for many grow rooms. A
refrigerated air conditioner can be installed if
heat and humidity are a major problem. Just
remember, air conditioners draw a lot of elec¬
tricity. If excessive heat is a problem, but humid¬
ity is not a concern, use a swamp cooler. These
evaporative coolers are inexpensive to operate
and keep rooms cool in arid climates.
Common thermostats include single-stage and
two-stage. The single-stage thermostat controls
a device that keeps the temperature the same
both day and night. A two-stage thermostat is
more expensive but can be set to maintain dif¬
ferent daytime and nighttime temperatures. This
convenience can save money on heating, since
room temperature can drop 5-10°F (2-5°C) at
night with little effect on growth.
Many new grow room controllers have been
developed in the last ten years. These control¬
lers can operate and integrate every appliance
in the grow room. More sophisticated control¬
lers integrate the operation of C02 equipment,

vent, and intake fans. Relatively inexpensive
computerized controllers are also available for
grow rooms. If temperature and humidity regu¬
lation are causing cultural problems in the grow
room, consider purchasing a controller.
Uninsulated grow rooms or grow rooms that
experience significant temperature fluctuations
require special consideration and care. Before
growing in such a location, make sure it is
the only choice. If forced to use a sun-baked
attic that cools at night, make sure maximum

insulation is in place to help balance tem¬
perature instability. Enclose the room to control
heating and cooling.
When C02 is enriched to 0.12-0.15 percent
(1200-1500 ppm), a temperature of 80°F
(27°C) promotes more rapid exchange of gases.
Photosynthesis and chlorophyll synthesis are
able to take place at a more rapid rate causing
plants to grow faster. Remember, this higher
temperature increases water, nutrient, and space
consumption, so be prepared! Carbon dioxideenriched plants still need ventilation to remove
stale, humid air and promote plant health.
The temperature in the grow room tends to
stay the same, top to bottom, when the air is cir¬
culated with an oscillating fan(s). In an enclosed
grow room, HID lamps and ballasts keep the
area warm. A remote ballast placed near the
floor on a shelf or a stand also helps break up
air stratification by radiating heat upward. Grow
rooms in cool climates stay warm during the day
when the outdoor temperature peaks, but often
cool off too much at night when cold tempera¬
tures set in. To compensate, growers turn on the
lamp at night to help heat the room, but leave it
off during the day.
Sometimes it is too cold for the lamp and
ballast to maintain satisfactory room tempera¬
tures. Grow rooms located in homes are usually
equipped with a central heating and/or air con¬
ditioning vent. The vent is usually controlled by
a central thermostat that regulates the tempera¬
ture of the home. By adjusting the thermostat to
72°F (22°C) and opening the door to the grow
room, it can stay a cozy 72°F (22°C). However,
using so much power is expensive, and could
cause a security quandary. Keeping the thermo¬
stat between 60 and 65°F (15-18°C), coupled
with the heat from the HID system, should be
enough to sustain 75°F (24°C) temperatures.
Other supplemental heat sources such as inef¬
ficient incandescent lightbulbs and electric heat¬
ers are expensive and draw extra electricity, but
they provide instant heat that is easy to regulate.
Propane and natural gas heaters increase tem¬
peratures and burn oxygen from the air, creating

C02 and water vapor as by-products. This dual
advantage makes using a C02 generator eco¬
nomical and practical.
Kerosene heaters also work to generate heat
and C02. Look for a heater that burns its fuel
efficiently and completely with no tell-tale
odor of the fuel in the room. Do not use old
kerosene heaters or fuel-oil heaters if they
burn fuel inefficiently. A blue flame is burning
all the fuel cleanly. A red flame indicates only
part of the fuel is being burned. I'm not a big
fan of kerosene heaters and do not recom¬
mend using them. The room must be vented
regularly to avoid buildup of toxic carbon
monoxide, also a by-product of combustion.
Diesel oil is a common source of indoor
heat. Many furnaces use this dirty, polluting
fuel. Wood heat is not the cleanest either,
but works well as a heat source. A vent fan
is extremely important to exhaust polluted air
and draw fresh air into a room heated by an
oil furnace or woodstove.
Insect populations and fungi are also affect¬
ed by temperature. In general, the cooler it is,
the slower the insects and fungi reproduce
and develop. Temperature control is effec¬
tively integrated into many insect and fungus
control programs. Check recommendations in
Chapter 14, "Pests, Fungi and Diseases."

Humidity
Humidity is relative; that is, air holds different
quantities of water at different temperatures.
Relative humidity is the ratio between the
amount of moisture in the air and the great¬
est amount of moisture the air could hold at
the same temperature. In other words, the
hotter it is, the more moisture air can hold;
the cooler it is, the less moisture air can hold.
When the temperature in a grow room drops,
the humidity climbs, and moisture condenses.
For example, an 800 cubic foot (10 x 10x8
feet) (21.5 m2) grow room will hold about
14 ounces (414 ml) of water when the tem¬
perature is 70°F (21°C) and relative humidity

is at 100 percent. When the temperature is
increased to 100°F (38°C), the same room will
hold 56 ounces (1.65 L) of moisture at 100
percent relative humidity. That is four times
more moisture! Where does this water go
when the temperature drops? It condenses,
onto the surface of plants and grow-room
walls, just as dew condenses outdoors.
Relative humidity increases when the tem¬
perature drops at night. The greater the tem¬

temperatures fluctuate more than 15°F (8°C).
Seedlings and vegetative plants grow best
when the relative humidity is from 60 to
70 percent. Flowering plants grow best in a
relative humidity range from 40 to 60 percent.
The lower humidity discourages diseases and
pests. As with temperature, consistent humid¬
ity promotes healthy, even growth. Relative
humidity level affects the transpiration rate
of the stomata. When humidity is high, water
evaporates slowly. The stomata close, tran¬
spiration slows, and so does plant growth.
Water evaporates quickly into drier air caus¬
ing stomata to open, increasing transpiration,
fluid flow, and growth. Transpiration in arid
conditions will be rapid only if there is enough
water available for roots to draw in. If water is
inadequate, stomata will close to

causing growth to slow.
When the relative humid¬

the pressure outside the leaf is
too high and inside too low. This
causes the stomata to close, which
slows growth. For example, a 40inch (1 m) tall plant can easily

This is the best relative humidity range for clones, as well as

Air conditioners cool and dehumidify grow rooms.
Growers must weigh the benefits against the
extra electricity they use.

Measuring Relative Humidity
Relative humidity control is an integral part
of insect and fungus prevention and control.
Humidity above 80 percent discourages spider
mites but promotes fungus as well as root and
stem rot. Humidity levels below 60 percent
reduce the chances of fungus and rot.
Measure relative humidity with a hygrometer.
This extremely important instrument will save
you and your garden much frustration and fungi.
By knowing the exact moisture content in the
air, humidity may be adjusted to a safe 40 to 60
percent level that encourages transpiration and
discourages fungus growth.
There are two common types of hygrometers.
The spring type is accurate within 5 to 10
percent. This hygrometer is inexpensive and
adequate for most hobby growers whose main
concern is to keep the humidity near 55 to 60
percent. The second type, a psychrometer, is
more expensive but very accurate. A psychrom¬
eter that measures relative humidity with a wet
and dry bulb is an excellent way to keep an
accurate vigil on relative humidity. Today there
are many exceptionally accurate high-tech gad¬
gets, plus they are equipped with memory!
A humidistat is similar to a thermostat, but
regulates humidity instead of temperature.
Humidistats are wonderful and make control¬
ling the environment very easy. Humidistats cost

m

less than $100 and are worth their weight in
resin glands. A humidistat and thermostat can
be wired "in line" to control a vent fan. Each can
operate the fan independently. As soon as the
humidity (or temperature) exceeds the accept¬
able range, the fan turns on to vent the humid
(or hot) air outdoors.
The HID lamp and ballast radiate heat, which
lowers humidity. Heat from the HID system and
a vent fan on a thermostat/humidistat are all
the humidity control necessary for most grow
rooms. Other dry heat sources, such as hot air
vented from a furnace or wood stove, dry the air
and lower the humidity. Be careful. Do not let
piped-in, warm, dry air blow directly on foliage.
It will rapidly dehydrate plants.
Increase humidity by misting the air with water
or setting out a bucket of water to evaporate into
the air. A humidifier is convenient and relatively
inexpensive. Humidifiers evaporate water into
the air to increase humidity. Just set the dial
to a specific humidity, and presto! The humid¬
ity changes to the desired level as soon as the
humidifier is able to evaporate enough water
into the air. A humidifier is not necessary unless
there is an extreme problem with the grow room
drying out. Problems seldom occur that can be
remedied by a humidifier. All too often, there is
too much humidity in the air as a result of irriga¬
tion and transpiration. If a ventilation system is
unable to remove enough air to lower humidity,
a dehumidifier could be just the ticket!
A dehumidifier removes moisture in a room
by condensing it from the air. Once the water
is separated from the air, it is captured in a
removable container. This container should be
emptied daily. It is easy to remove and catch 10
ounces (0.3 L) of water in a 10 x 10 x 8-foot
(21.5 m2) room when the temperature drops
just 10°F (5°C).
A dehumidifier can be used anytime to help
guard against fungus. Just set the dial at the
desired percent humidity and presto, perfect
humidity. Dehumidifiers are more complex, use
more electricity than humidifiers, and cost more,
but to growers with extreme humidity problems

not yet cured by a vent fan, they are worth the
added expense. The best prices on dehumidi¬
fiers have been found at Home Depot, Home
Base, and other discount stores. Check the
rental companies in the Yellow Pages for large
dehumidifiers if only needed for a short time. Air
conditioners also function as dehumidifiers but
use a lot of electricity. The water collected from
a dehumidifier or air conditioner has a very low
EC and can be used to water plants.
Note: Air conditioners draw moisture from
the air and lower the humidity. The moisture
condenses into water that is collected in a
container or expelled through a tube outdoors.
The condensed water carries the fragrance
of cannabis. Sniffer dogs can easily smell the
fragrance of cannabis in the "tainted" water
expelled outdoors.
Rooting clones thrive when the humidity is
from 70 to 100 percent. Under arid conditions,
the undeveloped root system is not able to sup¬
ply water fast enough to keep clones alive. See
"Clones and Cloning" for more specific informa¬
tion on humidity levels during different stages
of cloning.

C02 Enrichment
Carbon dioxide (C02) is a colorless, odorless,
nonflammable gas that is around us all the time.
The air we breathe contains 0.03-0.04 percent
C02. Rapidly growing cannabis can use all of
the available C02 in an enclosed grow room
within a few hours. Photosynthesis and growth
slow to a crawl when the C02 level falls below
0.02 percent.
Carbon dioxide enrichment has been used
in commercial greenhouses for more than 35
years. Adding more C02 to grow room air stimu¬
lates growth. Indoor cannabis cultivation is simi¬
lar to conditions in a greenhouse, and indoor
growers apply the same principles. Cannabis
can use more C02 than the 0.03-0.04 percent
(300-400 ppm) that naturally occurs in the
air. By increasing the amount of C02 to 0.120.15 percent (1200-1500 ppm)-the optimum
amount widely agreed upon by professional

growers—plants can grow up to 30 percent
faster, providing that light, water, and nutrients
are not limiting. Carbon dioxide enrichment has
little or no affect on plants grown under fluo¬
rescent lights. Fluorescent tubes do not supply
enough light for the plant to process the extra
available C02.
*Carbon dioxide can make people woozy
when it rises above 5000 ppm and can become
toxic at super high levels. When C02 rises to such
high levels, there is always a lack of oxygen!
Carbon dioxide enrichment does not make
plants produce more potent THC; it causes
more foliage to grow in less time. The larger the
volume of THC-potent cannabis, the larger the
volume of THC produced.
Carbon dioxide-enriched cannabis demands a
higher level of maintenance than normal plants.
Carbon dioxide-enriched plants use nutrients,
water, and space faster than non-enriched
plants. A higher temperature, from 75 to 80°F
(24 to 26°C) will help stimulate more rapid
metabolism within the super-enriched plants.
When temperatures climb beyond 85°F (29°C),
C02 enrichment becomes ineffective, and at
90°F (32°C) growth stops.
Carbon dioxide-enriched plants use more
water. Water rises from plant roots and is
released into the air by the same stomata the
plant uses to absorb C02 during transpiration.
Carbon dioxide enrichment affects transpiration
by causing the plants' stomata to partially close.
This slows down the loss of water vapor into the
air. Foliage on C02-enriched plants is measur¬
ably thicker, more turgid, and slower to wilt than
leaves on non-enriched plants.
Carbon dioxide affects plant morphology. In
an enriched growing environment, stems and
branches grow faster, and the cells of these
plant parts are more densely packed. Flower
stems carry more weight without bending.
Because of the increased rate of branching, can¬
nabis has more flower initiation sites. Plants that
sometimes do not bear from the first flower set
are more likely to set flowers early if C02 enrich¬
ment is used.

Measuring C02

Inexpensive electronic components have made it
possible for manufacturers to lower the price on
C02 monitors.
With C02-enriched air, plants that do not have
the support of the other critical elements for life
will not benefit at all, and the C02 is wasted. The
plant can be limited by just one of the critical
factors. For example, the plants use water and
nutrients a lot faster, and if they are not sup¬
plied, the plants will not grow. They might even
be stunted.
To be most effective, the C02 level must be
maintained at 1000 to 1500 ppm everywhere
in the room. To accomplish this, the grow room
must be completely enclosed. Cracks in and
around the walls should be sealed off to prevent
C02 from escaping. Enclosing the room makes
it easier to control the C02 content of the air
within. The room must also have a vent fan with
flaps or a baffle. The vent fan will remove the
stale air that will be replaced with C02-enriched
air. The flaps or baffle will help contain the C02
in the enclosed grow room. Venting require¬
ments will change with each type of C02-enrichment system and are discussed below.

Measuring and monitoring C02 levels in the
air is rather expensive and often unnecessary
for small growers. Monitoring C02 levels in grow
rooms with ten or more lights really helps keep
the levels consistent.
Disposable comparative colorimetry C02 test
kits are easy to use, accurate, and inexpensive.
The test kits contain a syringe and test tubes and
sell for about $30. To use the kit, break off each
end tip of the test tube, and insert one end into
the closed syringe. Pull 100 cubic centimeters
into the syringe, and note the blue color change
in the cylinder where the active ingredient reacts
with the C02 in the air drawn through the cylin¬
der. These kits are reliable to within 40 ppm.
Electrochemical sensing systems measure
electrical conductivity of an air sample in either
an alkali solution or distilled or deionized water.
These systems are relatively inexpensive, but
they have drawbacks: limited accuracy and sen¬
sitivity to temperature and air pollutants.
Infrared monitoring systems are more accurate
and versatile. They correctly measure C02 and
can be synchronized with controllers that oper¬
ate heat, ventilation, and C02 generators. Even
though the initial cost for a monitor is high, they
can solve many C02 problems before they occur
and can ensure optimum growing conditions.
Specialty indoor garden stores sell the monitors
for less than $1000.
Growers who do not want to spend the time
and energy required to monitor C02 can use
a set of scales and simple mathematics to
determine the approximate amount of C02 in
the air, but this calculation does not account for
ventilation, air leaks, and other things that could
skew the measurement. It is easier to measure
the amount of C02 produced rather than to
measure the amount of C02 in the grow room's
atmosphere.
To measure the amount of fuel used, simply
weigh the tank before it is turned on, use it
for an hour, and then weigh it again. The dif¬
ference in weight is the amount of gas or fuel
used. See the calculations (page 340) for more
information on calculating the amount of C02
in the room.

Producing C02
There are many ways to raise the C02 content
of an enclosed grow room. The two most popu¬
lar ways are to disperse it from a tank or burn
a fuel to manufacture it. Carbon dioxide is one
of the byproducts of combustion. Growers can
burn any fossil (carbon-based) fuel to produce
C02 except for those containing sulfur dioxide
and ethylene, which are harmful to plants.
Carbon dioxide gas is a by-product of fermen¬
tation and organic decomposition. The C02
level near the ground of a rain forest covered
with decaying organic matter could be two to
three times as high as normal, but bringing a
compost pile inside to cook down is not practi¬
cal. Dry ice is made from frozen C02. The C02
is released when dry ice comes in contact with
the atmosphere. It can get expensive and be a
lot of trouble to keep a large room constantly
supplied with dry ice. It is difficult to calculate
how much C02 is released into the air by fer¬
mentation, decomposition, or dry ice without
purchasing expensive equipment.

C02 Emitter Systems
Compressed C02 systems are virtually risk¬
free, producing no toxic gases, heat, or water.
These systems are also precise, metering an
exact amount of C02 into the room. Carbon
dioxide is metered out of a cylinder of the
compressed gas using a regulator, flow meter,
a solenoid valve, and a short-range timer. Two
types of systems are: continuous flow and short
range. Metal carbon dioxide cylinders which
hold the gas under 1000 to 2200 pounds of
pressure per square inch (psi) (depending upon
temperature) can be purchased from welding
or beverage supply stores. The cylinders are
often available at hydroponic stores. In North
America, cylinders come in three sizes: 20, 35,
and 50 pounds (9, 16, and 23 kg), and average
between $100 and $200 (with refills costing
about $30). Tanks must be inspected annually
and registered with a nationwide safety agency.
Welding suppliers and beverage suppliers often
require identification such as a driver's license.

When open, the red on/off valve on top supplies
compressed C02 via the regulator and flow meter.
An electric solenoid valve controls the timed
bursts of CO2 gas.

Most suppliers exchange tanks and refill them.
Fire extinguisher companies and beverage sup¬
ply companies normally fill C02 tanks on the
spot. If you purchase a lighter and stronger
aluminum tank, make sure to request an alu¬
minum tank exchange. Remember, the tank
you buy is not necessarily the one you keep. To
experiment before purchasing equipment, rent
a 50-pound (23 kg) tank. A large 50-pound (23
kg) cylinder is heavier but saves you the time of
returning to the store to have it refilled. When
full, a 50-pound steel tank weighs 170 pounds
(77 kg). A full 20-pound (9 kg) steel tank weighs
70 pounds (32 kg) and might be too heavy to
carry up and down stairs. A full 20-pound (9 kg)
aluminum tank weighs about 50 pounds (23
kg), and a full 35-pound (16 kg) tank weights
75 pounds (34 kg). Make sure C02 tanks have
a protective collar on top to shield the valve. If
the valve is knocked off by an accidental fall,
there is enough pressure to send the top (regu¬
lator, flow meter, valve, etc.) straight through a
parked car.
Buying a complete C02 emitter system at a
hydroponic store is the best option for most
closet growers. These systems offer a good
value for small indoor growers. You can make
your own system as described below, but these
systems often cost more than the pre-manufactured models.

To automate the system, you need a "short
range" digital timer to open the solenoid
valve for brief periods several times a day.
Control the exact amount of C02 released
into the garden room by altering the flow and
duration of C02. To determine how long the
valve should remain open, divide the number of
cubic feet of gas required by the flow rate. If the
flow meter is set at 10 cfh, the valve will need
to be open for 0.1 hours (1 divided by 10) or 6
minutes (0.1 hour x 60 minutes) to bring the
room up to 1500 ppm. Remember, C02 leaks
out of the grow room. On average, the C02 level
of the room returns to 300 ppm in about three
hours due to plant usage and room leakage. To
A setup consists of a tank of C02 gas, regulator,
solenoid valve, and a flow meter.

of C02 released per hour into two or four smaller
increments dispersed more frequently.

and cooler than air and cascades onto the plants

Carbon dioxide is very cold when released
from a bottle where it has been kept under
pressure. Even a quick blast can do damage
to skin or eyes. If the flow rate is above 20
cfh, your regulator might freeze.
A regulator and flow valve are essential, but
the solenoid valve and the timer are optional.
However, growers who do not use a solenoid
valve and timer waste C02. The solenoid
valve and timer regulate the flow of C02. A
solenoid valve is electrically operated and is
used to start and stop the gas flow from the
regulator and flow meter. The least expensive
timer is plastic and is commonly used for
automatic sprinkler systems, but 240-, 115-,
24- and 12-volt systems are available. They
cost about the same, but the lower voltages
offer added safety from electrical shock.

below.
To make sure the C02 is dispersed from the
tubing evenly, submerge the lightweight plastic
tubing in water and punch the emission holes
under water while the C02 is being piped into
the line. This way you know the proper diameter
holes to punch and where to punch them to cre¬
ate the ideal C02 flow over the garden.
Overhead fans help distribute C02 evenly
throughout the room. The C02 is released directly
below the fan into its airflow. This evenly mixes
the C02 throughout the air and keeps it recircu¬
lating across the plants.
Compressed C02 is expensive, especially in
large grow shows. At roughly $0.50 per pound
(450 gm), compressed gas is much more expen¬
sive than fuels used in generators. Cost of equip¬
ment and fuel make compressed C02 enrich¬
ment systems less economical than generators.

C02 Generator Systems
CO, generators are used by commercial flow¬
er, vegetable, and marijuana growers. Green
Air Products has introduced a complete line
of reasonably priced C02 generators that burn
natural gas or LP (propane) to produce C02.
However, heat and water are by-products of
the combustion process. Generators use a pilot
light with a flow meter and burner. The inside
of the generator is similar to a gas stove burner
with a pilot light enclosed in a protective hous¬
ing. The generator must have a cover over the
open flame. You can operate the generators
manually or synchronize them with a timer to
operate with other grow room equipment such
as ventilation fans.
C02 generators produce hot exhaust gasses
(C02 + H20). Even though C02 is heavier than
air, it is hotter and therefore less dense and
rises in a garden room. You must have good air
circulation for even distribution of C02.
Carbon Dioxide generators can burn any fos¬
sil fuel-kerosene, propane, or natural gas. Low
grades of kerosene can have sulfur content as
high as 0.01 of 1 percent, enough to cause
sulfur dioxide pollution. Use only high-quality
kerosene even though it is expensive. Always
use grade "1-K" kerosene. Maintenance costs
for kerosene generators are high, because they
use electrodes, pumps, and fuel filters. For most
grow rooms, propane and natural gas burners
are the best choice.
When filling a new propane tank, first empty
it of the inert gas which is used to protect it
from rust. Never completely fill a propane tank.
Propane expands and contracts with tempera¬
ture change and could release flammable gas
from the pressure vent if too full.
Generators burn either propane or natural gas,
but must be set up for one or the other. They are
inexpensive to maintain and do not use filters
or pumps. Hobby C02 generators range from
$300 to $500, depending on size. The initial
cost of a generator is slightly higher than a C02
emitter system that uses small, compressed-gas
cylinders. Nonetheless, growers prefer propane

C02 generators produce carbon dioxide by
burning LP or propane gas. They also generate
heat and water vapor as by-products.

Spray soapy water around all propane gas
connections to check for bubbles (leaks).

and natural gas generators, because they are
about four times less expensive to operate than
bottled C02 generators. One gallon of propane,
which costs about $2, contains 36 cubic feet of
gas and over 100 cubic feet of C02 (every cubic
foot of propane gas produces 3 cubic feet of
C02). For example, if a garden used one gallon
of propane every day, the cost would be about
$60 per month. In contrast, bottled C02 for the
same room would cost more than $200 per
month!
C02 generators are less expensive to maintain
and less cumbersome, but they have some
disadvantages, too. One pound of fuel produces
1.5 pounds of water and 21,800 Btu of heat.
For grow rooms less than 400 cubic feet, this
makes generators unusable. Even for larger gar-

1 pound of C02 displaces 8.7 cubic feet (246 cm3) of C02.
0.3 pound (0.135 kg) of fuel produces 1 pound (454 gm) of C02.
\
\

Divide the total amount of C02 needed by 8.7 and multiply by 0.33 to determine the amount
of fuel needed. In our example we found we need 1 cubic foot of C02 for an 800 cubic foot
garden room.
L x W x H = room volume (cubic feet)
12 x 14 x 8= 1344 cubic feet (38 m3)
Desired C02 level is 1200 ppm (0.0012 ppm)*
Multiply room volume by 0.0012 = desired C02 level
1344 cubic feet (38 m3) x 0.0012 = 1.613 cubic feet (46 cm3) C02
1 pound (0.45 kg) of fuel burned = three pounds (1.35 kg) of C02 gas
0.33 pound (0.148 kg) fuel burned = one pound C02 gas
0.33 x 1.613 = 0.56 pounds of C02 fuel to burn to bring the C02 level to 1200 ppm.
Three times this amount (0.53 x 3 = 1.59 pounds) of fuel will create enough C02 for the room
for 12-18 hours.
Convert this into ounces by multiplying by 16 (there are 16 ounces in a pound). .037 x 16 =
0.59 ounces of fuel are needed for every injection.

den rooms, the added heat and humidity must
be carefully monitored and controlled so as not
to affect plants. Growers in warm climates do
not use generators, because they produce too
much heat and humidity.
If fuel does not burn completely or cleanly,
C02 generators can release toxic gases—includ¬
ing carbon monoxide—into the grow room.
Nitrous oxide, also a byproduct of burning pro¬
pane, can grow to toxic levels, too. Well-made
C02 generators have a pilot and timer. If leaks
or problems are detected, the pilot and timer
will turn off.
A C02 monitor is necessary if you are sensitive
to high levels of the gas. Digital alarm units or
color change plates (used in aircraft) are an
economical alternative. Carbon monoxide is a

deadly gas and can be detected with a carbon
monoxide alarm available at most hardware
and building supply stores.
Check homemade generators frequently,
including kerosene or gas heaters. Propane and
natural gas produce a blue flame when burning
efficiently. A yellow flame means unburned gas
(which creates carbon monoxide) and needs
more oxygen to burn cleanly. Leaks in a system
can be detected by applying a solution of equal
parts water and concentrated dish soap to all
connections. If bubbles appear, gas is leaking.
Never use a leaky system.
Oxygen is also burned. As it becomes deficient
in the room, the oxygen/fuel mixture changes.
The flame burns too rich and yellows. This is
why fresh air is essential.

AIR
Turn off C02 generators at night. They create
excess heat and humidity in the grow room,
and they need oxygen to operate. At night,
roots need the extra oxygen in the room for
continued growth.
If you are using C02 and the yield does not
increase, check to make sure the entire grow
room is running properly and that plants have
the proper light and nutrient levels, as well as
the correct temperature, humidity, grow-medium moisture, and pH. Make sure roots receive
enough oxygen both day and night.

Other Ways to Make C02
There are many ways to make C02. You can
enrich small areas by burning ethyl or methyl
alcohol in a kerosene lamp. Norwegians are
studying charcoal burners as a source of C02.
When refined, the system will combine the
advantages of generators and compressed gas.
Charcoal is much less expensive than bottled
C02 and is less risky than generators in terms
of toxic by-products. Others are studying the
use of new technology to extract or filter C02
from the air.
This little inexpensive puck called Excellofizz
(www.fearlessgardener.com) releases C02 into
the atmosphere. It is simple to use; just add a
few ounces of water and a puck or two to cause
a chemical reaction that will disperse enough
C02 to augment the air in a 10-foot-square (9
m2) room to about 1000 ppm all day. It also
releases a eucalyptus fragrance to help mask
odors. Make sure to keep the fizz contained,
and if using an ozone generator, keep the lamp
clean.

Compost and Organic Growing
Mediums
Decomposing organic materials like wood
chips, hay, leaves, and manures release large
amounts of C02. Although you can capture
C02 from this decomposition, it is most often
impractical for indoor growers. Piping indoors
the C02 and fumes from a compost pile is
complicated, expensive, and more work than
it is worth.

The Excellofizz puck is a low-cost product that releases
C02 when it is bathed in water.

Fermentation
Small-scale growers use fermentation to pro¬
duce C02. Combine water, sugar, and yeast
to produce C02. The yeast eats the sugar
and releases C02 and alcohol as by-products.
Growers who brew beer at home can use a
small-scale system to increase the C02 levels
in a room. Non-brewers can mix one cup of
sugar, a packet of brewer's yeast, and three
quarts of warm water in a gallon jug to make
C02. You will have to experiment a little with
the water temperature to get it right. Yeast dies
in hot water and does not activate in cold water.
Once the yeast is activated, C02 is released into
the air in bursts. Punch a small hole in the cap
of the jug, and place it in a warm spot (80 to
95°F [26 to 34°C]) in your grow room. Many
gardeners buy a fermentation lock^available for
under $10 at beer-brewing stores). Such locks
prevent contaminants from entering the jug,
and they bubble C02 through water so the rate
of production can be observed. The hitch is that
you must change the concoction up to three
times a day. Pour out half the solution, and add
1.5 quarts (1.4 L) of water and another cup (24
cl) of sugar. As long as the yeast continues to
grow and bubble, the mixture can last indefi¬
nitely. When the yeast starts to die, add another
packet. This basic formula can be adapted to

make smaller or larger-scale fermenters. Several
jugs scattered around the garden room have a
significant impact on C02 levels.
Fermentation is an inexpensive alternative to
produce C02. It releases no heat, toxic gases,
or water and uses no electricity. But because it
stinks, it is unlikely that a gardener could toler¬
ate a large-scale fermentation process. In addi¬
tion, it is difficult to measure C02 production
from this system, making it difficult to maintain
uniform levels throughout the day.

Dry Ice
Dry ice gets very expensive with prolonged
use. Two pounds of dry ice will raise the C02
level in a 10 x 10-foot (3 m2) grow room to
about 2000 ppm for a 24-hour period. One
chagrined grower remarked, "I can't believe that
stuff melts so fast."
Growers have long used large, insulated tanks
filled with dry ice to add C02. Dry ice is carbon
dioxide that has been chilled and compressed.
As it melts, it changes from solid to gas. Gaseous
C02 can be mixed into the air with fans that cir¬
culate it among the plants. Dry ice works well on
a smaller scale without a tank and converter. It
is readily available (check out the Yellow Pages)
and inexpensive. Because C02 has no liquid
stage, the transformation from solid to gas as
the ice melts is clean and tidy. It's also easy to
approximate the amount of C02 being released.
A pound of dry ice is equal to a pound of liquid
C02. Determining the thawing period for a par¬
ticular size of dry ice will allow you to estimate
how much C02 is released during a particular
time period. To prolong the thawing process,

put dry ice in insulating containers such as foam
ice coolers, and cut holes in the top and sides to
release the C02. The size and number of holes
allow you to control the rate at which the block
melts and releases C02.
Dry ice is economical and risk free; it releases
no toxic gases, heat, or water. Although dry ice
is easier to handle than compressed C02 tanks,
it is difficult to store. The melting can be slowed
through insulation, but it cannot be stopped.
Because it is extremely cold, dry ice can also
cause tissue damage or burn the skin after pro¬
longed contact.

Baking Soda and Vinegar
Consider using vinegar and baking soda to
produce C02 in a small grow room. This method
eliminates excess heat and water vapor produc¬
tion and requires only household items. Create
a system that drips vinegar (acetic acid) into a
bed of baking soda. The main disadvantage of
this system is the erratic level of C02 produced.
It takes a considerable amount of time for the
C02 to build up to a level where it helps plants.
However, once it reaches an optimum level, it
can continue to rise until it reaches levels detri¬
mental to plants. If you have time to experiment,
it is possible to set up a drip system operated by
a solenoid valve and a short-term timer. With
such a system, C02 could be released periodi¬
cally in small increments and coordinated with
ventilation schedules.
Note: Some recipes replace vinegar with muri¬
atic (hydrochloric) acid. I advise using vinegar,
because hydrochloric acid is very dangerous. It
can burn flesh, eyes, and respiratory system; it
can even burn through concrete.

Odor
A good exhaust fan, vented outdoors, is the first
step in cannabis odor control and the easiest way
to keep the house from reeking of fresh marijua¬
na. If the odor is strong and venting is a problem,
a negative ion generator (deionizer); deodor¬
izing liquid, gel, puck, or spray; ozone generatoractivated charcoal filter; or a combination of two
or more of these will solve fragrance problems.

Deodorizers
Kill odors by changing their structure at the
molecular level. Products such as Odor Killer™,
Ona™, VaporTek™, and Ozium™, are made from
essential oils that kill odors by creating a neutral
atmosphere at the atomic level. Such products
are usually available in gel and spray. Many
growers prefer to use the gel over the long
term and spray for emergency situations, such
as when unexpected guests stop by during
harvest.
The deodorizers can be set out in the room,
around the house, and near doorways. Several
companies offer products that stick to the wall.
One ingenious grower I interviewed stuck one
such deodorizing puck to the inside of the
front door, just below the mail slot to keep the
house fresh. Other products are designed to be
attached to the ventilation ductwork system.
Often these products are used not only to alter
the odor of marijuana, but also to alter the
telltale odor produced by an ozone generator.
Other companies offer aerosol spray cans with
a dispenser that periodically meters out a burst
of spray.

pouring vinegar on baking soda is a fair source

Negative Ion Generators
Negative ion generators are small and some¬
what efficient to control odors, smoke, airborne
pollen, mold, dust, and static electricity. They
pump negative ions into the atmosphere. The
negative ions are attracted to positive ions
containing odors and other airborne pollutants.
The negative ions attach to positive ions, and
the odor becomes neutralized. The particles fall
to the floor and create a fine covering of dust
on the ground, walls, and objects in the room.
These devices work fairly well for small grow
rooms with minimal odor problems. The gen¬
erator uses very little electricity and plugs into a
regular 115-volt current. Visually check the filter
every few days, and make sure to keep it clean.

Ozone Generators
Ozone has many applications including food
and water sterilization and removing odors from

overpower fragrance. Such products are available
in liquid, gel, and spray forms.

the air at the molecular level. Some growers
even use high levels of ozone to exterminate
grow room pests.
Ozone generators neutralize odors by convert¬
ing oxygen (02) into ozone (03) by exposing
the stinky air to ultraviolet (UV) light. The extra
molecule is always a positively charged ion that
is predisposed to attach to a negatively charged
ion (cation). Odors are negatively charged cat¬
ions. When the extra oxygen ion attaches to
the cation, they neutralize one another and the
odor, too. Once the extra molecule is shed, 03
is converted back into 02. The chemistry takes a
minute or longer to occur, so treated air must be
held in a chamber to be converted effectively.
Ozone has an unusual odor similar to the
smell of the air after a good rain. Anybody who
has ever smelled the air in a room recently
treated with ozone knows the smell and will
never forget it. Make sure not to produce too
much ozone, and give it enough time to mix
with smelly air to neutralize odors. The distinc¬
tive odor of excess ozone exiting a building will
tip off narcs and thieves. For this reason, many
growers also use a carbon filter to further scrub
the air.
There are many ozone generators available.
When shopping for an ozone generator, look
for one that has been on the market for a few
years and has an established track record. Watch
^

This grower treats the air with ozone and
deodorizes air again just before it is expelled.

Ozone generators are rated by the number of
cubic feet (m3) they are able to treat.

for important features such as self-cleaning (or
easy to clean) and easy, safe bulb replacement.
When UV light encounters moisture in the air,
nitric acid is produced as a by-product. This
white, powdery nitric acid collects around the
lamps at connection points. This is an unpleas¬
ant, very corrosive acid that will severely burn
skin and eyes. Verify that the ozone generator
has proper safety features built in, such as a
switch that turns off the lamp for maintenance,
making it impossible to look at the retina-sear¬
ing UV rays. Legal exposure for humans is about
0.1 ppm for a maximum of 8 hours. Most grow
room ozone generators produce about 0.05
ppm at timed intervals. See (page 348) for plant
symptoms of ozone overdose.
UV light is very dangerous. In a flash, intense
UV light can burn your skin and the retinas in
your eyes beyond repair. Never, under any cir¬
cumstances, look at the UV lamp in an ozone
generator. Sneaking a peek at a UV lamp in an
ozone generator has cost more than one aspir¬
ing grower their eyesight! Ozone is also capable
of burning your lungs. At low levels, there is no
damage, but at higher levels, danger is immi¬
nent. Never, never use too much!
The Air Tiger™, manufactured by Rambridge,
www.rambridge.com, is an excellent value for
growers. It is one of the safest available and
easy to maintain. A deadman's switch makes
direct eye contact with the 10-inch-long UV light
tube impossible. Highly corrosive ozone stays
away from interior wiring, and little moisture
can penetrate the outer shell to combine with
03 to form powdery nitric acid.
Ozone generators are rated by the number of
cubic feet (m3) they are able to treat. (To figure
cubic feet or meters, multiply the length x width
x height of the room). Some growers set up the
ozone generator in the grow room and let it treat
all the air in the room. They add a timer so the
ozone generator intermittently disperses ozone
into the room to maintain a relatively constant
level. This practice can diminish the fragrance of
the bud. Smart growers set up an ozone genera¬
tor in a spare closet or build an ozone exchange

The Air Tiger is a very popular ozone generator
that is designed to fit inside ductwork.

Mixing ozone-treated air for a minute or more
allows 03 to shed a molecule and become 02.

chamber and route fragrant grow room air
through the closet for ozone treatment before
being evacuated outdoors. Other growers set up
the ozone generator in ventilation ductwork to
treat air before it exits. Once generated, ozone
has a life of about 30 minutes. It takes a minute
or two for the 03 molecules to combine with
oxygen to neutralize odors.

Ozone Damage
For best results, keep the ozone generator
in another room or isolated from the growing
plants. Ozone causes chlorotic spots on leaves.
The mottled spots that appear at first to be a
Mg deficiency, increase in size and turn dark
in the process. Most often, the symptoms are

found on foliage near the generator. Leaves
wither and drop, and overall plant growth slows
to a crawl.

Activated Carbon Filters

A vent-fan duct hooks to each tube, and the
air-cleansing agent is imparted before air is
evacuated.

Ozone generators are located inside ducting.
Grow room air mixes with ozone in ducting and
big metal box. Air smells fresh and clean once
treated properly with ozone.

Activated charcoal filters are fantastic, and they
work! The charcoal is "activated" with oxygen,
which opens millions of pores in the carbon.
The activated charcoal absorbs odor molecules
and other pollutants in the air. The mechanics
are simple, and there are three important things
to remember when using a charcoal filter. First,
keep room humidity below 55 percent. At about
65 to 70 percent relative humidity, the charcoal
absorbs moisture and clogs. At 80 percent
humidity, it stops removing odors. Second, air
must move slowly through charcoal filters to
extract odors. The fan on professional units lets
just enough air through the filter so the odors
have enough (dwell) time to be absorbed by
the carbon filter. Third, use a pre-filter. The pre¬
filter catches most of the dust and airborne pol¬
lutants before they foul the carbon filter. Change
the pre-filter regularly-every 60 days, or more
often if the room is dusty. Carbon lasts about
a year. Many growers prefer activated carbon
made from coco. Do not use activated carbon
that is "crushed," because it is less efficient than
charcoal pellets.
Install an intake screen that filters out large
particles of dust to prolong the life of the activat¬
ed charcoal filter. Whether the intake is passive
or brought in by a fan, use a filter for incoming
air to minimize pollutants in the grow room.

Ozone can severely damage foliage. This is what
it does to foliage.

Charcoal filters remove fragrance and pollen from the air. The model shown above has a half-inch outer
filter that encases porous ducting surrounded by activated charcoal. These filters are efficient until humidity
climbs beyond 60 percent, at which point moisture-filled charcoal fails to absorb.

Check with filter manufacturers or retailers
about venting specifications for your grow area.
A more powerful exhaust fan will be necessary
to draw an adequate volume of air through the
activated charcoal filter. An adequate airflow is
imperative to keep a high C02 content in the
grow room air.

Setting Up the Vent Fan Step-by-Step
Step One: Figure the total volume of the grow
room. Length x width x height = total volume.
For example, a grow room that is 10 x 10 x 8 feet
(21.5 m2) has a total volume of 800 cubic feet (10
x 10 x 8 feet = 800 cubic feet) (21.5 m2). A room
measuring 4x5x2 meters has a total volume of
40 cubic meters.
Step Two: Use a vent fan that will remove the
total volume of air in the room in less than five
minutes. Buy a fan that can easily be mounted
on the wall or inline in a duct pipe. Quality inline
fans move much air and make very little noise.

It's worth spending the extra money on an "in
line" fan. Small rooms can use a fan that can be
attached to a flexible 4-inch (12 cm) dryer hose.
Many stores sell special ducting to connect high¬
speed squirrel cage fans with the 4-inch (12 cm)
ducting.
Step Three: Place the fan high on a wall or near
the ceiling of the grow room so it vents off hot,
humid air.
Step Four: If possible, cut a hole in the wall,
and secure the fan in place over the hole. Most
locations require special installation. See: Steps
5-9 below.
Step Five: To place a fan in a window, cut a
0.5-inch (1.5 mm) piece of plywood to fit the
windowsill. Cover window with a lightproof
dark-colored paint or similar covering. Mount
the fan near the top of the plywood so it vents
air out of the grow room. Secure the plywood
and fan in the windowsill with sheet rock
screws. Open the window from the bottom.
Step Six: Another option to make a lightproof
vent is to use 4-inch (12 cm) flexible dryer duct-

An activated charcoal filter is attached to a vent fan. The air is cleaned before leaving the grow room.

ing. Vent the hose outdoors, and attach a
small squirrel cage fan to the other end of
the ducting. Make sure there is an airtight
connection between the fan and hose by
using a large hose clamp or duct tape.
Stretch the flexible ducting so it is as smooth
as possible inside. Irregular interior surfaces
cause air turbulence and seriously diminish
airflow.
Step Seven: Another option is to vent the
air up the chimney or into the attic where
light leakage and odor are seldom a prob¬
lem. If using the chimney for a vent, first
clean out the excess ash and creosote. Tie a
chain to a rope. Lower the chain down the
chimney, banging and knocking all debris
inside to the bottom. There should be a door
at the bottom to remove the debris. This
door is also used as the exhaust vent.
Step Eight: Attach the fan to a thermostat/
humidistat or other temperature/humidity
monitor/control device to vent hot, humid
air outside. Set the temperature on 75°F
(24°C) and the humidity on 55 percent in
flowering rooms and 60 to 65 percent in

Can carbon filters are available in many sizes and are
a popular brand.

Air is deodorized by an ozone generator that is inside this ducting.

vegetative rooms. Most control devices have
wiring instructions. More sophisticated con¬
trollers have built-in electrical outlets, and the
peripherals are simply plugged into them.
Step Nine: Or attach the vent fan to a timer
and run it for a specific length of time. This is

the method used with C02
enrichment. Set the fan to
turn on and vent out used
C02-depleted air just before
new C02-rich air is injected.

Air flow and volume are diminished when they turn corners.

This grower uses insulated ducting to dampen
noise and vibrations caused by moving air.

A small fan placed in a window box
removes smelly air 24 hours a day.

Turning air around a corner keeps grow room light from signaling passersby.

Here is a charcoal filter without the outer dust filter. The inline fan adds extra suction to pull and push air
through flexible ducting before it meets the extraction fan at the end of the duct.

PESTS, FUNGI & DISEASES

This beautiful greenhouse crop was destroyed by Botrytis.

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GRi
Introduction
Insects, mites, and maggots slither into grow
rooms eating, reproducing, and wasting weed.
Outdoors, they live everywhere they can. Indoors,
they live anywhere you let them. Fungi are pres¬
ent in the air at all times. They may be introduced
by an infected plant or from air containing fungus
spores. Fungi will settle down and grow if climatic
conditions are right. Pests, fungi, and diseases can
be prevented, but if allowed to grow unchecked,
extreme control measures are often necessary to
eradicate them.

Simple hygiene in the grow room keeps pests and
diseases in check.

Dirty grow rooms help cause pest and disease
problems.

Sweep the grow room floor every few days to
avoid problems with pests and diseases.

342

Prevention
Cleanliness is the key to insect and fungus
prevention. The grow room should be totally
enclosed so the environment can be controlled
easily. Keep the floor clean. Keep all debris off soil
surface. Do not use mulch. Insects and fungi like
nice hideaway homes found in dirty, dank cor¬
ners, and under dead decaying leaves or rotting
mulch. Growers and their tools often transport
many microscopic pests, diseases, and fungi that
could ultimately destroy the garden. This does not
mean growers and their tools have to be hospital
clean every time they enter a grow room, even
though that would be nice. It does mean normal
and regular sanitary precautions must be taken.
Growers who wear clean clothes and use clean
tools reduce problems considerably. A separate
set of indoor tools is easy to keep clean. Pests, dis¬
eases, and fungi habitually ride from plant to plant
on dirty tools. Disinfect tools by dipping in rubbing
alcohol or washing with soap and hot water after
using them on each diseased plant. Another quick
way to sterilize pruners is with a hand-held torch.
A quick heating with the torch will sterilize metal
tools immediately.
Personal cleanliness is fundamental to prevent¬
ing pests and diseases. Wash your hands before
touching foliage and after handling diseased
plants. Smart growers do not walk around the
buggy outdoor garden and then visit the indoor
garden. They do it vice versa. Think before enter¬
ing the indoor garden and possibly contaminating
it. Did you walk across a lawn covered with rust
fungi or pet the dog that just came in from the
garden outside? Did you just fondle your spider
mite-infested split-leaf philodendron in the living
room? Avoid such problems by washing your
hands, and changing shirt, pants, and shoes
before entering an indoor garden.

ter FOURTEEN
Once a crop has been grown in potting soil or
soilless mix, throw out the grow medium. Some
growers brag about using the same old potting
soil over and over, unaware that this savings is
repaid with a diminished harvest. Used soil may
harbor harmful pests and diseases that have
developed immunity to sprays. Starting a new
crop in new potting soil will cost more up front
but will eliminate many potential problems. Used
soil makes excellent outdoor garden soil.
Be careful when discarding used soil! Growers
in Eugene, Oregon, tossed their outdoor soil out
in the backyard for many years. The soil was
about 50 percent white perlite and had a distinc¬
tive color. This oversight eventually led to the
growers' arrest.
Once potting soil is used, it loses much of the
fluff in the texture, and compaction becomes a
problem. Roots penetrate compacted soil slowly,
and there is little room for oxygen, which restricts
nutrient uptake. Used potting soil is depleted of
nutrients. A plant with a slow start is a perfect tar¬
get for disease, and worst of all, it will yield less!
Companion planting helps discourage insects
outdoors. Pests have nowhere to go indoors, so
companion planting is not viable in the grow
rooms.
Plant insect- and fungus-resistant strains of
marijuana. If buying seeds from one of the many
seed companies, always check for disease resis¬
tance. In general, Cannabis indica is the most
resistant to pests, and sativa is more resistant to
fungal attacks. Choose mother plants that you
know are resistant to pests and diseases.
Keep plants healthy and growing fast at all
times. Disease attacks sick plants first. Strong
plants tend to grow faster than pests and dis¬
eases can spread.
Forced air circulation makes life miserable for
pests and diseases. Pests hate wind because
holding on to plants is difficult, and flight paths
are haphazard. Fungal spores have little time to
settle in a breeze and grow poorly on wind-dried
soil, stems, and leaves.
Ventilation changes the humidity of a room
quickly. In fact, a vent fan attached to a humidistat is often the most effective form of humidity
control. Mold was a big problem in one of the
grow rooms that I visited. The room did not have
a vent fan. Upon entering the enclosed room, the
humid air was overpowering. It was terrible! The
environment was so humid that roots grew from

Healthy plants are easy to keep strong
and are able to fight off pests and diseases.

plant stems. The grower installed a vent fan to
suck out moist, stale air. The humidity dropped
from nearly 100 percent to around 50 percent.
The mold problem disappeared, and harvest
volume increased.
Indoor horticulturists who practice all the pre¬
ventative measures have fewer problems with
pests and diseases. It is much easier to prevent
the start of a disease than it is to wipe out
an infestation. If pests and diseases are left
unchecked, they can devastate the garden in a
few short weeks.

Control
Sometimes, even when all preventative mea¬
sures are taken, pests and diseases still slink in
and set up housekeeping. First, they establish a
base on a weak, susceptible plant. Once set up,
they launch an all-out assault on the rest of the
garden. They move out in all directions from the
infested base, taking over more and more space,
until they have conquered the entire garden. An
infestation can happen in a matter of days. Most
insects lay thousands of eggs in short periods of
time. These eggs hatch and grow into mature
adults within a few weeks. For example, if 100
microscopic munchers each laid 1000 eggs dur¬
ing their two weeks of life and these eggs grew
into adults, two weeks later 100,000 young
adults would lay 100 eggs each. By the end of
the month, there would be 100,000,000 pests
attacking the infested garden. Imagine how many
there would be in another two weeks!

Sprays often kill adults only. In general, sprays
should be applied soon after eggs hatch so young
adults are caught in their weakest stage of life.
Very lightweight (low viscosity) horticultural oil
spray works well alone or as an additive to help
kill larvae and eggs.
The availability of some sprays can be seasonal,
especially in more rural areas. Garden sections of
stores are changed for the winter, but extra stock
is sometimes kept in a storage room. Look for
bargains on sprays at season-end sales. Today,
there are many indoor grow stores that carry pest
and disease controls all year round.

Insect Control

Manually remove small populations of pests by
smashing pests and eggs between your fingers.
Make sure to wash your hands afterward.

Indoor gardeners have many options to control
insects and fungi. Prevention and cleanliness are
at the top of the control list. A logical progres¬
sion to pest and disease control is outlined in
the chart on this page. (Note that it begins with
cleanliness!)
Manual removal is just what the name implies
-smashing ail pests and their eggs in sight
between the thumb and forefinger or between
two sponges.
I like natural-organic sprays such as pyrethrum
and neem and use harsh chemicals only as a
last resort. Any spray, no matter how benign,
always seems to slow plant growth a little.
Stomata become clogged when foliage is sprayed

A 30X battery-powered magnifying scope makes
insects and diseases easier to identify.

Yellow sticky traps are used to monitor pest
populations as well as to control small flying
insects.

and covered with a filmy residue. Stomata stay
plugged up until the spray wears off or is washed
off. Stronger sprays are often more phytotoxic,
burning foliage. Spray plants as little as possible
and avoid spraying for two weeks before harvest.
Read all labels thoroughly before use.
Use only contact sprays that are approved
for edible plants. Avoid spraying seedlings and
tender unrooted cuttings. Wait until cuttings are
rooted and seedlings are at least a month old
before spraying.

Sprays and Traps
I do not recommend using chemical fungicides,
fungistats, insecticides, or miticides on plants
that are destined for human consumption. Most
contact sprays that do not enter the plant system
are approved for edible fruits and vegetables.
However, there are numerous ways to control
fungi, diseases, and pests without resorting to

Spreader-Sticker for Pesticides
Spreader-stickers improve and promote wetting
and increase sticking and absorption through
foliage. Spreader-sticker products increase effec¬
tiveness of fertilizers, fungicides, insecticides, etc.
They are especially important to use when plants
develop a waxy coating of resin. Spreader-stickers
also impair insects' respiration mechanisms and
function as pesticides. One of my favorite spread¬
er-stickers is Coco-Wet from Spray-N-Grow.

Abamectin
Ingredients: Abamectin derivatives include
emamectin and milbemectin. Does not bioac¬
cumulate. Used extensively on hops; abamectin is
not truly systemic. It is absorbed from the exterior
of foliage to other leaf parts, especially young
leaves, in the process of translaminar activity.
Controls: Russet and spider mites, fire ants,
leafminers, and nematodes.
Mixing: Dilute in water. Mix 0.25 teaspoon
(0.125 cl) per gallon (3.8 L). Use a wetting
agent.

ture is above 70°F (21 °C). Repeat applications
every seven to ten days.
Persistence: One day.
Forms: Liquid.
Toxicity: Toxic to mammals, fish, and honey¬
bees in high concentrations. Sucking insects are
subject to control while beneficials are not hurt.
Safety: Wear gloves, mask, and safety glasses.

Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and Bacillus
species
Ingredients: Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is the
best known of several bacteria that are fata! to
caterpillars, larvae, and maggots.
Caterpillars, larvae, and maggots ail eat Bt
bacteria, which can be applied as a spray, dust,
or granules. Inject liquid Bt into stalks to kill bor¬
ers. Shortly after they ingest it, their appetite is
ruined, and they stop eating. Within a few days
they shrivel up and die; cabbage loopers, cabbageworms, corn earworms, cutworms, gypsy
moth larvae, and hornworms are controlled.
Commercial Bt products do not reproduce within

insect bodies, so several applications may be
necessary to control an infestation. Microbial Bt
bacteria are nontoxic to animals (humans), ben¬
eficial insects, and plants; however, some people
do develop an allergic reaction. Commercial Bt
products do not contain living Bt bacteria, but
the Bt toxin is extremely perishable. Keep within
prescribed temperature range, and apply accord¬
ing to the directions. Most effective on young
caterpillars, larvae, and maggots, so apply as soon
as they are spotted.
Get the most out of Bt applications by adding a
UV inhibitor, spreader-sticker, and a feeding stim¬
ulant such as Entice®, Konsume® or Pheast®. Bt
is completely broken down by UV light in one to
three days.
B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Btk)-introduced
on the market in the early 1960s-is the most
popular Bt. Toxic to many moth and caterpillar
larvae including most of the species that feed on
flowers and vegetables. Sold under many trade
names DiPel®, BioBit®, Javelin®, etc., Btk is also
available in a microencapsulated form, M-Trak®,
Mattch®, etc. The encapsulation extends the
effective life on foliage to more than a week.
B. thuringiensis var. aizawai (Bta) is effective
against hard-to-kill budworms, borers, armyworms and pests that have built up a resistance
to Btk.
B. thuringiensis var. israeiensis (Bt-i) is effective
against the larvae of mosquitoes, black flies, and
fungus gnats. Look for Gnatrol®, Vectobac®, and
Bacrimos®. All are lethal to larvae. Adults do not
feed on plants and are not affected. Fungus gnats
can cause root problems including rot. Use Bti to
get rid of them as soon as they are identified.
B. thuringiensis var. morrisoni is a new strain
of Bt under development for insect larvae with a
high pH in their guts.
B. thuringiensis var. san diego (Btsd) targets the
larvae of Colorado potato beetles and elm beetle
adults and other leaf beetles.
B. thuringiensis var. tenebrionis (Btt) is lethal to
Colorado potato beetle larvae.
B. cereus helps control damping-off and rootknot fungus. It flourishes in water-saturated
mediums and promotes beneficial fungus that
attacks the diseases.
B. subtilis is a soil-dwelling bacterium that curbs
Fusarium, Pythium, and Rhizoctonia that cause
damping-off. It is commercially available under

PESTS & DISEASES
the brand names Epic®, Kodiac®, Rhizo-Plus®,
Serenade®, etc. Soak seeds and apply as a soildrench.
B. popilliae colonize larvae and grub bodies
that consume it, causing them to turn milkywhite before dying. It is often called milky spore
disease. It is most effective against Japanese
beetle grubs.

equal parts with powdered sugar
to make toxic bait.
Application: Set bait out on soil
near base of plants.
Persistence: Avoid getting bait wet as it dis¬
perses rapidly.
Forms: Powder.
Toxicity: Not toxic to honeybees and birds.
Safety: Avoid breathing dust.

Copper
Ingredients:

The

compounds-copper
sulfate,
copper oxychloride, cupric
hydroxide and cuprous oxide
-are common forms of fixed
copper used as a fungicide
and are less phytotoxic than
unfixed (pure) copper.
Controls: Gray mold, foliar
fungus, anthracnose, blights,
mildews, and a number of
bacterial diseases.
Caution: Easy to overapply
and burn foliage or create a
copper excess in plant.

spraying, so ingredients do not settle out. Preferred
temperature range for application is 65-85°F (1829°C).
Persistence: Lasts two weeks or longer indoors,
if not washed off.
Forms: Powder and liquid.
Toxicity: Toxic to fish. Not toxic to birds, bees,
mammals.
Safety: Wear a mask and gloves, cover exposed
skin and hair.

Diatomaceous Earth (DE)
Bug Bombs
Ingredients: Often bug bombs are packed with
very strong insecticides and miticides, including
synthetic pyrethrins that exterminate every pest
in the room. They were developed to kill fleas,
roaches, and their eggs that hide in furniture and
in carpets.
Controls: According to most bug bomb labels,
they kill everything in the room!
Caution: Use only as a last resort and follow the
label's instructions to the letter.
Mixing: None.
Application: Place the bug bomb in the empty
room. Turn it on and then leave the room.
Persistence: Low residual. Persistence is limited
to a day or two.
Forms: Aerosol.
Toxicity: Read label for details.
Safety: Wear a mask, gloves, and cover exposed
skin and hair.

Ingredients: Naturally occurring DE includes
fossilized-silica-shell, remains of the tiny onecelled or colonial creatures called diatoms. It also
contains 14 trace minerals in a chelated (available)
form.
Controls: Although not registered as a pesticide
or fungicide, DE abrades the
waxy coating on pest shells and
skin, including aphids and slugs,
causing body fluids to leak out.
Once ingested, the razor-sharp
particles in DE rip tiny holes in
the pest's guts, causing death.
Caution: Do not use swim¬
ming pool diatomaceous earth.
Chemically treated and heated,
it contains crystalline silica that
is very hazardous if inhaled. The
body is unable to dissolve the
crystalline form of silica that
causes chronic irritation.

Mixing: No mixing required when used as a
dust. Mixing required when used as spray. Apply
as a powder or encircle slug-damaged plants and
use as a barrier.
Application: Apply this spray to infestations
caused by pest insects.
Persistence: Stays on foliage for a few days or
until washed off.
Forms: Powder.
Toxicity: Earthworms, animals, humans, and
birds can digest diatomaceous earth with no illeffects. Avoid contact with skin and eyes.
Safety: Wear a protective mask and goggles
when handling this fine powder to guard against
respiratory and eye irritations.

Homemade Pest and Disease Sprays
Ingredients: A strong, hot taste, smelly odor, and
a desiccating powder or liquid are the main ingre¬
dients in home-brewed pesticide and fungicide
potions. See below.
Controls: Homemade sprays discourage and
control pests including aphids, thrips, spider mites,
scale, and many others.
Caution: Be careful when testing a new spray.
Apply it to a single plant and wait for a few days to
learn the outcome before applying to all plants.
Mixing: Make spray concentrates by mixing
repellent substances with a little water in a blend¬
er. Strain the resulting slurry concentrate through
a nylon stocking or fine cheesecloth before being
diluted with water for application.
Application: Spray foliage until it drips from
both sides of leaves.
Persistence: A few days.
Forms: Liquid.
Toxicity: Usually not toxic to humans in dosages
lethal to pests.
Safety: Wear a mask and gloves, and cover skin
and hair. Avoid contact with eyes, nose, lips, and
ears.

Neem
Ingredients: Relatively new in the USA, neem
has been used for medicine and pest con¬
trol for more than four centuries in India and
Southeast Asia. Extracted from the Indian neem
tree, Azadirachta indica, or the chinaberry tree,
Melia azedarach, neem is an antifeedant and
disrupts insect life cycles. The trees are known as
the village pharmacy because they supply cures

Homemade sprays can be made by blending
water, lemon, vegetable oil, and garlic.
for humans and animals as well as safely control
countless pests and fungi. Neem powder is made
from leaves. The active ingredient, azadirachtin,
confuses growth hormones and pests never
mature into adults to produce more young. It is
most effective against young insects and is avail¬
able in various concentrations. It also contains
N-P-K and trace elements.
Controls: Most effective against caterpillars and
other immature insects including larvae of whiteflies, fungus gnats, mealybugs, and leafminers.
Caution: Neem is not as effective against spider
mites as neem oil.
Mixing: Often mixed with vegetable (canola) oil.
Mix just before using in water with a pH below 7
and use a spreader-sticker. Agitate constantly while
using to keep emulsified, throw out excess.
Application: Use as a soil-drench or add to the
nutrient solution. This allows neem to enter into
the plant's tissue and become systemic. Used as
a spray, neem becomes a contact spray and an

Recipes and Controls Chart
Ingredients:
Alcohol: Use isopropyl (rubbing). Add to sprays
to dry out pests.
Bleach: Use a 5 percent solution as a general
disinfectant.
Cinnamon: Dilute cinnamon oil with water. Use
just a few drops per pint as pesticide.
Citrus: Citrus oils make great ingredients that
kill insects dead.
Garlic: Use a garlic press to squeeze garlic juice
into mix. Use liberal amounts.
Horseradish: Stinky stuff! Add as you would
garlic. Best to use fresh root.
Hot pepper: Dilute Tabasco® or any storebought concentrate in water.
Hydrated lime: Saturate in water to form a
fungicide.
Mint: Mint oil drives insects away. Dilute in
water, measure several drops per pint.
Oil, vegetable is comprised mainly of fatty acids
and glycerides. Mix with rubbing alcohol to
emulsify in water. Great stuff!
Oregano: Grind up fresh herb and use as a
repellent. Mix with water.
Soap: I like Ivory® or Castille® soap. Use as an
insecticide and wetting agent. Mix with water.
Tobacco: Mix tobacco with hot water to extract
the poisonous alkaloid. Do not boil. Dilute con¬
centrate with water.

Recipe 1. Mix three tablespoons (4.5 cl) each
of isopropyl alcohol, lemon juice, garlic juice,
horseradish juice, Ivory liquid, and a few drops of
Tabasco®, mint, and cinnamon oil. Mix all of the
ingredients in a small bowl into a slurry. Dilute
the slurry at the rate of one teaspoon (0.5 cl per
47 cl) per pint of water and mix in a blender.
Potent mix!

Recipe 2. Place one teaspoon (0.5 cl) of hot
pepper or Tabasco® sauce and four cloves of
garlic in a blender with a pint of water and
liquefy, then strain through a nylon stocking or
cheesecloth before using in the sprayer.

Recipe 3. A mix of one-eighth to one-quarter
cup (3-6 cl) of hydrated lime combined with a
quart (0.9 L) of water makes an effective insect

Precautions:
Cooking or heating preparations can destroy
active ingredients. To draw out (extract) ingredi¬
ents, mince plant and soak in mineral oil for a
couple of days. Add this oil to the water includ¬
ing a little detergent or soap to emulsify the oil
droplets in water. Biodegradable detergents and
soaps are good wetting-sticking agents for these
preparations. Soap dissolves best if a teaspoon
(0.75 cl) of alcohol is also added to each quart
(0.9 L) of mix.
Chrysanthemum, marigold, and nasturtium
blossoms; pennyroyal; garlic; chive; onion; hot
pepper; insect juice (target insects mixed in a
blender); horseradish; mint; oregano; tomato;
and tobacco residues all will repel many insects
including aphids, caterpillars, mites, and whiteflies.
Spray made from pests ground up in a blender
and emulsified in water will reputedly repel
related pests. Best used on large pests! The
insecticidal qualities in the dead bug parts will
degrade quickly if combined with other things;
do not include insects mixed in a blender with
other ingredients besides water.
Mixes that
include tobacco may kill these pests if it is
strong enough. These mixes can vary in propor¬
tions, but always filter the blended slurry before
mixing with water for the final spray. Straining
avoids clogging spray nozzles and plumbing.
and mite spray. Mix a non-detergent soap with
lime. The soap acts as both a sticking agent and
insecticide. Lime can be phytotoxic to plants in
large doses. Always try the spray on a test plant
and wait a few days to check for adverse effects
to the plant before applying to similar plants.

Recipe 4. Liquid laundry bleach-sodium hypochlorite-is a good fungicide for non-plant surfac¬
es. Mix as a five or ten percent solution. It is an
eye and skin irritant, so wear gloves and goggles
when using it. Mix 1 part bleach to 9 parts water
for a 5 percent solution. Mix one part to four
parts water for a 10 percent solution. Use this
solution as a general disinfectant for grow room
equipment, tools, and plant wounds. The bleach
solution breaks down rapidly and has little, if
any, residual effect.

rust.
Caution: Neem oil is very
effective against spider mites.
Mixing: Mix just before using in water with a
pH below 7 and use a spreader-sticker. Agitate
constantly while using to keep emulsified. Throw
out excess.
Application: Spray on foliage, especially under
leaves, where mites live. Apply every few days
so hatching larvae will eat it immediately. Spray
heavily so mites have little choice but to eat it.
Avoid spraying the last few days before harvest.
Some growers report a foul taste when applied
just before harvest.

Neem Oil
"A Natural Leaf Polish"

Persistence: Contact neem stays on foliage for
up to a month or until it is washed off. Stays in
plant system up to a month when absorbed via
roots.

Ingredients: Nicotine is a nonpersistent pesti¬
cide derived from tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum.
It is a stomach poison, contact poison, and respi¬
ratory poison. This very poisonous compound
affects the neuromuscular system, causing pests
to go into convulsions and die. Nicotine sulfate is
the most common form.
Caution: Do not swallow any of this vile poison,
and avoid skin contact. Do not use around night¬
shade family-eggplants, tomatoes, peppers and
potatoes-because they may contract Tobacco
Mosaic Virus (TMV) from exposure to tobaccobased substances.
Controls: Sucking and chewing insects.
Mixing: Use a spreader-sticker.
Application: Seldom phytotoxic when used
as directed. Combine with insecticidal soap to
increase killing ability.
Persistence: One week to ten days.
Forms: Liquid.
Toxicity: Although naturally derived, nicotine is
very toxic to most insects (including beneficials),
honeybees, fish, and humans. If concentrate is
ingested or built up over years, humans may
develop lung cancer and other cancers.
Safety: Wear a mask and gloves; avoid skin and
eye contact.

Oil, Horticultural
Ingredients: Often underrated and overlooked
as an insecticide and miticide, horticultural oil
is very popular in greenhouses and is regain¬
ing popularity among indoor growers. Similar
to medicinal mineral oil, horticultural oils are
made from animal (fish) oils, plant seed oils, and
petroleum oils refined by removing most of the

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL CROWE
portion that is toxic to plants. Lighter weight oil
(viscosity 60-70) is less phytotoxic. Vegetable oil
is also horticultural oil.
Controls: Virtually invisible, horticultural oil kills
slow moving and immobile sucking insects, spi¬
der mites and their eggs by smothering, as well
as generally impairing their life cycle.
Caution: Do not use lubricating oils such as 3in-1 or motor oil!
Mixing: Mix 3/4 teaspoon (0.75 cl) of oil sprayno more than a one percent solution-per quart
(0.9 L) of water. More than a few drops could
burn tender, growing shoots.
Application: Spray foliage entirely, including
under the suface of the leaves. Apply oil sprays up
until two weeks before harvest. Repeat applica¬
tions as needed. Usually three applications, one
even/ five to ten days, will put insects and mites
in check. Lightweight-oil residue evaporates into
the air in a short time.
Persistence: Disappears in one to three days,
under normal growing conditions.
Forms: Liquid
Toxicity: Safe, nonpoisonous, and nonpolluting
insecticide. Can become phytotoxic if too heavy
(viscosity), if applied too heavily, or when tem¬
peratures are below 70°F (21°C), or very humid;
this slows evaporation, increasing phytotoxicity.
Safety: Wear a mask and gloves.

Oil, Vegetable
Ingredients: Fatty acids and glycerides.
Controls: Lightweight vegetable oil kills slowmoving and immobile sucking insects, spider
mites, and their eggs by smothering as well as
generally interrupting their life cycles.
Caution: Vegetable oil does not kill as well as
horticultural oil.
Mixing: Mix two drops of oil spray-no more
than a one percent solution-per quart of water.
Application: Spray foliage entirely, including
under surface of leaves. Stop spraying two weeks
before harvest.
Persistence: Several days.
Forms: Liquid.
Toxicity: Not toxic to mammals or fish.
Safety: Wear a mask and gloves.

Pyretbrum
Ingredients: Pyrethrum, the best-known botan¬
ical pesticide, is extracted from the flowers of
the pyrethrum chrysanthemum, Chrysanth-emum

coccineum and C. cinerariifoliu. Pyrethrins- pyrethrins, cinerins, and jasmolins-are the
active ingredients in natural
pyrethrum and kills insects on
contact. Pyrethrum is often
combined with rotenone or
ryania to ensure effective¬
ness. Aerosol forms contain
synergists. (See "Application"
below.)
Controls: A broad-spectrum
contact pesticide, pyrethrum
kills aphids, whiteflies, spider
mites, and insects including Pyrethrum
beneficials. It is very effective
to control flying insects, but they must receive a
killing knockdown dose, or they may revive and
buzz off.
Caution: Do not mix with sulfur, lime, copper,
or soaps. The high pH of these substances render
it ineffective. Wash these substances off foliage
with plain water (pH below 7) before applying
pyrethrum.
Mixing: Mix in water with a pH below 7 and use
a spreader-sticker.
Application: Spot spray infested plants. Aerosol
sprays are most effective especially on spider
mites. This can burn foliage-spray is ice-cold
when it exits the nozzle-if applied closer than
one foot. Aerosol spray contains a synergist,
piperonyl butoxide (PBO) or MGK 264. Both are
toxic to people. Pyrethrum dissipates within a
few hours in the presence of air, HID light, and
sunlight. Overcome this limitation by applying
just before turning off the lights, the circulation,
and vent fans for the night. One manufacturer,
Whidmere®, offers encapsulated pyrethrum in
aerosol form called Exclude®. As the spray fogs
out of the nozzle, a bubble forms around each
droplet of pyrethrum mist. The outside coating
keeps the pyrethrum intact and extends its life
for several days. When a pest prances by touch¬
ing the bubble, it bursts, releasing the pyrethrum.
Liquid and wettable pyrethrum applied with a
pump-type sprayer is difficult to apply under
leaves where spider mites live.
Persistence: Effective several hours after appli¬
cation when the lights are on, longer when
applied after lights-out and the fan is turned off.
Forms: Wettable powder, dust, liquid, granular
bait, and aerosol.

Chapter FOURTEEN
Toxicity: Not toxic to animals and humans
when eaten, but becomes toxic to people when
inhaled. It is toxic to fish and beneficials.
Safety: Wear a mask and protective clothing
when applying sprays or breathing in any form of
pyrethrum, especially aerosols. Aerosols contain
toxic PBO and MGK 464-possible carcinogens
-which are easily inhaled.

PESTS & DISEASES
Application: Spray on foliage until saturated.
Persistence: Two to five days on the surface
of plants.

Forms: Bark, wood chips, and shavings.
Toxicity: Safe for mammals and (possibly)
beneficials.
Safety: Wear a mask and gloves.

Rotenone
Synthetic Pyrethroids
Ingredients: Synthetic pyrethroids such as permethrin and cypermethrin act as broad-spectrum,
Nonselective contact insecticides and miticides.
There are more than 30 synthetic pyrethroids
available in different formulations. Deltamethrin
is available as a sticky paint that is used as a
trap when applied to stems and colored objects.
Other pyrethroids include Allethrin, cyflutrin, fenpropathin, phenothrin, sumithrin, resmitherin,
and tefluthrin.
Controls: Aphids, whiteflies, thrips, beetles,
cockroaches, caterpillars, and spider mites. NOTE:
Many insects and mites are resistant to pyre¬
throids.
Caution: Nonselective pyrethroids kill all insects
and mites including beneficials and bees.
Mixing: Follow directions on container.
Application: Follow directions on container.
(See "Application" under "Pyrethrum.")
Persistence: Breaks down in one to three days.
Newer pyrethroids, such as Permethrin, stay
active the longest.
Forms: Powder, liquid, aerosol.
Toxicity: Toxic to all insects. It is somewhat toxic
to mammals.
Safety: Wear a mask and protective clothing
when applying sprays or breathing in any form of
pyrethrum, especially aerosols. Aerosols contain
toxic PBO and MGK 464-possible carcinogenswhich are easily inhaled.

Quassia
Ingredients: Quassia is made from a subtropi¬
cal South American tree, Quassia amara, and the
tree-of-heaven, Ailanthus altissima.
Controls: Soft-bodied insects including aphids,
leafminers, and some caterpillars.
Mixing: Available in the form of bark, wood
chips, and shavings. Soak 6 ounces (18 cl) of
chips per gallon (0.9 L) of water for 24 hours.
Afterward, boil for two hours. Add a potassiumbased soap to increase effectiveness. Strain and
cool before spraying.

Ingredients: Rotenone is an extract of roots
of several plants including Derris species,
Lonchocarpus species, and Tephrosia species.
This poison is a Nonselective contact insecticide,
stomach poison, and slow-acting nerve poison.
Controls: Nonselective control of beetles, cat¬
erpillars, flies, mosquitos, thrips, weevils, and
beneficial insects, but death is slow. According
to Hemp Diseases and Pests, target insects can
consume up to 30 times their lethal dose before
dying!
Caution: Kills beneficials. New evidence indi¬
cates rotenone may be toxic to people and may
cause Parkinson's disease. Use only as a last
resort!
Mixing: Follow directions on the package.
Application: Follow directions on the package.
Persistence: Breaks down in three to ten days.
Forms: Powder, wettable powder, liquid.

Ingredients: This alkaloid pesticide is made
from the seeds of a tropical lily, Schoenocaulon
officinale, native to Central and South America,
and a European hellebore, Veratrum album.
Controls: A contact and stomach poison, this
centuries-old poison controls aphids, beetles,
cabbage loopers, chinch bugs, grasshoppers, and
squash bugs.
Caution: Very toxic to honeybees and moder¬
ately toxic to mammals!
Mixing: Follow directions on package.
Application: Most potent when applied at 7580°F. Follow directions on package.
Persistence: Two or three days.
Forms: Powder, liquid.
Toxicity: Somewhat toxic to mammals, toxic to
honeybees.
Safety: Wear a mask, gloves, and safety glasses,
and cover exposed skin and hair. Avoid skin, eye,
ear, and nose contact. Irritates eyes and nose.

Seaweed
Ingredients: Numerous elements including
nutrients, bacteria, and hormones.
Controls: Suspended particles in seaweed
impair, and even kill, insects and spider mites by
causing lesions. The particles cut and penetrate
the soft-bodied pest insects and mites causing
their body fluids to leak out.
Mixing: Dilute as per instructions for soil appli¬
cation.
Application: Spray on foliage, especially under
leaves where mites live.
Persistence: Up to two weeks when spreadersticker is used.
Forms: Powder and liquid.
Toxicity: Not toxic to mammals, birds, and fish.
Nonselective, kills beneficials.
Safety: Wear a mask and gloves.

Soap, Insecticidal
Ingredients: Mild contact insecticides made
from fatty acids of animals and plants. A variety of
soaps are available in potassium-salt based liq¬
uid concentrates. Soft soaps such as Ivory liquid
dish soap, Castille soap, and Murphy's Oil soap
are biodegradable and kill insects in a similar

manner to commercial insecticidal
soaps, but they are not as potent
or effective.
Controls: Controls soft-bodied
insects such as aphids and mealy
bugs, spider mites, thrips, and
whiteflies by penetrating and clog¬
ging body membranes.
Caution: Do not use detergent
soaps because they may be caus¬
tic.
Mixing: Add a few capfuls of soap
to a quart of water to make a spray.
Ivory or Castille soap can also be
used as a spreader-sticker to mix
with other sprays. The soaps help
the spray stick to the foliage better.
Application: Spray at the first appearance of
insect pests. Follow directions on commercial
preparations. Spray homemade mixes every four
to five days.
Persistence: Soft soaps will last only for about
a day before dissipating.
Forms: Liquid.
Toxicity: These soaps are safe for bees, animals,
and humans.
Safety: Wear a mask and gloves.

is more toxic to insects but more phytotoxic to
plants.
Controls: Centuries-old fungicide is effective
against rusts and powdery mildew.
Caution: Do not apply in temperatures above
90°F (32°C) and less than 50 percent humidity. It
will burn foliage.
Mixing: Follow directions on package.
Application: Apply in light con¬
centration. It is phytotoxic during
hot, 90°F, arid weather.
Persistence: It stays on foliage
until washed off.
Forms: Powder.
Toxicity: Not toxic to honeybees,
birds, and fish.
Safety: Wear a mask, gloves, and
safety goggles; cover exposed skin

control thrips. Other insects get stuck
haphazardly to the sticky stuff.
Black-light traps catch egg-laying
Tanglefoot moths and other flying insects most
of which are not plant pests. Light
and fan traps attract many insects
including beneficials, and their use may do more
harm than good.
Sex-lure traps exude specific insect phero¬
mones, sexual scents, of females that are ready
to mate. These traps are most effective to monitor
insect populations for large farms.
Caution: Do not touch sticky substance. It is dif¬
ficult to remove!
Mixing: Follow directions on container. Smear
on desired objects.
Application: Smear Tanglefoot™ around the
edges of pots, base of stems, and at the end of
drying lines to form an impenetrable barrier-trap
against mites and insects. This simple precaution
helps keep mites isolated. However, resourceful
spider mites can spin a web above the barrier.
The marauding mites also ride the air currents
created by fans from plant to plant!
Persistence: It is persistent until it is wiped off
or completely fouled with insect bodies.
Forms: Sticky, thick paint.
Toxicity: Not toxic to mammals or insects.
Trapped insects and mites starve to death.
Safety: Wear gloves.

Water

Caution: Avoid spraying fully formed buds with
water. Standing water in or on buds promotes
gray mold. Do not apply hot steam to foliage.
Mixing: None.
Application: Spray leaf undersides with a jet
of cold water to knock off sucking spider mites
and aphids. Apply water as a mist or spray when
predatory mites are present. The extra humid
conditions impair the pest mite lifecycles and
promote predatory mite health. Rent a wallpaper
steamer. Get it cooking, and direct a jet of steam
at all grow-room cracks and surfaces.
Persistence: None.
Forms: Liquid, steam vapor.
Toxicity: Not toxic to mammals, fish, and ben¬
eficials.
Safety: Do not spray strong jet of water in eyes,
up nose, or into other body orifices.

Biological Controls
Predators and Parasites
Predator and parasite availability and supply
have changed substantially over the last 10 years.
Today, many more predators and parasites are
available to home growers than ever before.
Shipping, care, cost, and application of each
predator or parasite is very specific and should be
provided in detail by the supplier. Make sure the
supplier answers the following questions:
1) Latin name of the predator so there is no
confusion as to identity.
2) Specific pests attacked.
3) Life cycle.
4) Preferred climate including temperature and
humidity range.
5) Application rate and mode of application.
For more information about predators check
out the following web pages:
www.naturescontrol.com
www.koppert.nl/english
www.entomology.wisc.edu/mbcn/mbcn.html

Ingredients: A cold jet of water-preferably with
a pH between 6 and 7-blasts insects, spider mites,
and their eggs off leaves and often kills them. Hot
water vapor and steam also work as a sterilant.
Controls: A cold jet of water is an excellent
first wave of attack against spider mites, aphids,
and other sucking insects. Steam controls spider
mites, insects, and diseases on pots, growing
medium, and other grow-room surfaces.

By definition, a predator must eat more than
one victim before adulthood. Predators, such as
ladybugs (ladybird beetles) and praying mantises,
have chewing mouthparts. Other predators, such
as lacewing larvae, have piercing-sucking mouthparts. Chewing predators eat their prey whole.
The piercing, sucking-type, suck the fluids from
their prey's body.

Parasites consume a single individual host
before adulthood. Adult parasitoids typically place
a single egg into many hosts. The egg hatches
into larvae that eat the host insect from the inside
out. They save the vital organs for dessert! Most
often, the larvae pupate inside the host's body
and emerge as adults.

Spiders are predatory and eat other insects. If you
see a spider in the garden, let it help you!

Young spider mites, adults, and eggs are visible
in this photo.

Parasites, unlike predators, hunt until the prey
is almost eliminated. Predators choose to be
surrounded by prey. When prey population starts
to diminish a little, predators move on to find a
nice, fat infestation. They never truly eradicate
the pests. This is why predators work best for
preventative control, but are slow to stop an
infestation.
The rate at which the predators and parasites
keep the infestation in check is directly propor¬
tionate to the amount of predators. The more
predators and parasites, the sooner they will get
infestations into check. Predators and parasites
outbreed their victims, reproducing faster than
pests are able to keep up with.
One of the best places in the country to buy
predatory and parasitoid insects is from Nature's
Control, Medford, Oregon. Check out their very
informative web site at www.naturescontrol.com.
This supplier gives advice and supplies specific
care and release instructions. Nature's Control
has a good predator and parasite supply and
can ship year round. Predators and parasites are
shipped special delivery and may arrive after the
daily-mail delivery. Make sure to pick them up as
soon as they arrive. Do not let predators sit inside
a mailbox in the hot sun. It could easily reach
120°F (49°C) or more!
When predators and parasites are introduced
into a garden, special precautions must be taken
to ensure their well-being. Stop spraying all-toxic
chemicals at least two weeks before introducing
the predators. Pyrethrum and insecticidal soaps
can be applied up to a few days before, providing
any residue is washed off with fresh water. Do
not spray after releasing predators and parasites.
Predators and parasites survive best in gardens
that are not sterilized between crops. Gardens
with perpetual harvests are ideal for predators.
Most of the predators and parasites that do
well in an indoor HID garden cannot fly. Insects
that can fly often head straight for the lamp.
Ladybugs are the best example. If 500 ladybugs
are released on Monday, by Friday, only a few diehards will be left. The rest will have popped off
the lamp. If using flying predators or parasitoids,
release when it is dark. They will live longer.
Predators are most often very small and must be
introduced to each plant separately. Introducing
predators to a garden and plants takes a little
time and patience. Predators also have very

Spider Mites and insects
Here is one of the best web sites I have found
that describes insects. They have excellent photos
of all pests and predators that attack marijuana:

Spider Mites
Identify: The spider mite is the most common
pest found on indoor plants and causes the most
problems. Spider mites have eight legs and are
classified as spiders rather than insects, which
have six legs. Find microscopic spider mites on
leaf undersides sucking away life-giving fluids. To
an untrained naked eye, they are hard to spot.
Spider mites appear as tiny specks on leaf under¬
sides; however, their telltale signs of feedingyeilowish-white spots, stippling-on the tops of
leaves are easy to see. Careful inspection reveals
tiny spider webs-easily seen when misted with
water-on stems and under leaves as infesta¬
tions progress. A magnifying glass or low-power
microscope (10-30X) helps to identify the yellowwhite, two-spotted brown or red mites and their
translucent eggs. Indoors, the most common is
the two-spotted spider mite. After a single mat¬
ing, females are fertilized for life and reproduce
about 75 percent female and 25 percent male
eggs. Females lay about 100 eggs.

Spider mites cause stippling, small spots, on the
top of leaves.

Damage: Mites suck life-giving sap from plants,
causing overall vigor loss and stunting. Leaves are
pocked with suck-hoie marks and yellow from
failure to produce chlorophyll. They lose partial

Once a plant is overrun with spider mites, the
infestation progresses rapidly. Severe cases cause
plant death.
Controls: Cleanliness! This is the most impor¬
tant first step to spider mite control. Keep the
grow room and tools spotless and disinfected.
Mother plants often have spider mites. Spray
mothers regularly with miticides, including once
three days before taking cuttings. Once mite
infestations get out of control and miticides work
poorly, the entire grow room will have to be
cleaned out and disinfected with a pesticide and
5 percent bleach solution. Steam disinfection is
also possible but too difficult in most situations.
Cultural and physical control: Spider mites
thrive in a dry, 70-80°F (21-27° C) climate, and
reproduce every five days in temperatures above
80°F (27° C). Create a hostile environment by
lowering the temperature to 60°F (16°C) and
spray foliage, especially under leaves, with a
jet of cold water. Spraying literally blasts them
off the leaves as well as increases humidity.
Their reproductive cycle will be slowed, and you
will have a chance to kill them before they do
much damage. Manual removal works for small
populations. Smash all mites in sight between
the thumb and index finger, or wash leaves
individually in between two sponges. Avoid
infecting other plants with contaminated hands
or sponges.
Remove leaves with more than 50 percent
damage and throw away, making sure insects

and eggs do not reenter the garden. If mites
have attacked only one or two plants, isolate
the infected plants and treat them separately.
Take care when removing foliage not to spread
mites to other plants. Severely damaged plants
should be carefully removed from the garden
and destroyed.
Smear a layer of Tanglefoot™ around the lips of
containers and at the base of stems to create bar¬
riers spider mites cannot cross. This will help iso¬
late them to specific plants. Note: smear a layer
of Tanglefoot™ at each end of drying lines when
hanging buds to contain spider mites. Once foli¬
age is dead, mites try to migrate down drying
lines to find live foliage with fresh, flowing sap.

Biological: Neoseiulus (Amblyseius) californicus and Mesoseiulus (phytoseiulus) longipes, are
the two most common and effective predators.

Phytoseiulus persimilis, Neoseiulus (Amblyseius)
fallacius, Calendromus (Metaseiulus) occidentalis, and Galendromus (Typhlodromus) pyri preda¬
tors are also available commercially.
When properly applied and reared, preda¬
tory spider mites work very well. There are many

Progressive Control Measures
for Spider Mites
Cleanliness - Clean room daily, disinfect tools,
do not introduce new pests into the
garden on clothes, no animal visits, etc.

Create hostile environment - Humidity,
temperature, water spray.

Create barriers - Smear Tanglefoot™ around
pot lips, stems, drying lines.

Dip cuttings and vegetative plants - Dip small
plants in pyrethrum, horticultural oil,
neem oil.

Remove damaged foliage - Remove foliage
Keep relative humidity
below 50 percent to
discourage bud mold.
If plants are infested with
spider mites, lower the
temperature to 60-70°F (1021°C). This temperature range
will slow their reproduction.

more than 50 percent damaged.

Introduce predatory mites - Release predators
before infestations grow out of hand.

Spray - Apply pyrethrum or neem oil; use strong
miticides only if necessary. Rotate sprays
so mites do not develop immunity.

Chapter FOURTEEN
things to consider when using the predators. First,
predators can eat only a limited number of mites
a day; the average predator can eat 20 eggs or 5
adults daily. As soon as the predators' source of
food is gone, some mites die of starvation while
others survive on other insects or pollen. Check
with suppliers for release instructions of specific
species. A general dosage of 20 predators per plant
is a good place to start. Predatory mites have a dif¬
ficult time traveling from plant to plant, so setting
them out on each plant is necessary. Temperature
and humidity levels must be at the proper levels
to give the predators the best possible chance to
thrive. When spider mites have infested a garden,
the predatory mites cannot eat them fast enough
to solve the problem. Predatory mites work best
when there are only a few spider mites. Introduce
predators as soon as spider mites are seen on
vegetative growth, and release them every month
thereafter. This gives predators a chance to keep
up with mites. Before releasing predators, rinse all
plants thoroughly to ensure all toxic-spray residues
from insecticides and fungicides are gone.
The fungus, Hirsutella thompsonii, trade name
Mycar®, kills spider mites.
Sprays: Homemade sprays often lack the strength
to kill infestations but work as a deterrent by repel¬
ling mites. Popular homemade sprays include Dr.
Bonner's Soap, garlic, hot pepper, citrus oil, and liq¬
uid seaweed combinations. If these sprays do not
deter spider mites after four to five applications,
switch to a stronger spray: neem oil, pyrethrum,
horticultural oil, or nicotine sulfate, cinnamaldehyde.
Insecticidal soap does a fair job of controlling
mites. Usually two or three applications at five- to
ten-day intervals will do the trick.
Horticultural oil smothers eggs and can be mixed
with pyrethrum and homemade sprays to improve
extermination.
Pyrethrum (aerosol) is the best natural miticide!
Apply two to three applications at five- to ten-day
intervals. Pyrethrum is the best control for spider
mites. Spider mites should be gone after two or
three applications at five- to ten-day intervals, pro¬
viding sanitary preventative conditions are main¬
tained. Eggs hatch in five to ten days. The second
spraying will kill the newly hatched eggs and the
remaining adults. The third and subsequent appli¬
cations will kill any new spider mites, but mites
soon develop a resistance to synthetic pyrethrum.
Neem oil works great!

PESTS & DISEASES
Heavy-duty chemical miticides are available but
are not recommended on plants that will be con¬
sumed by humans. If using any chemical miticide,
be sure it is a contact poison and not systemic.
Use StirrupM®, described below, to improve the
spider mite kill rate. Cinnamaldehyde extracted
from Cinnamonum zeylanicum kills mites. The
synthetic hormone-sold under the brand name
StirrupM®-attracts spider mites, and is used very
successfully to enhance miticides.

Aphids
Identify: Aphids, also called plant lice, are
about the size of a pinhead. They are easy to spot
with the naked eye, but use a 10X magnifying
glass for positive identification. Aphids are found

Ants farm aphids. They move aphids to
uninfected plants.
in all climates. Normally grayish to black, aphids
can be green to pink-in any color, aphids attack
plants. Most aphids have no wings, but those
that do have wings that are about four times the
size of their bodies. Aphids give birth to mainly
live female larvae, without mating, and can pump
out 3 to 100 hungry larvae every day. Each female
reproduces between 40 and 100 offspring that
start reproducing soon after birth. Aphids are
most common indoors when they are plentiful
outdoors. Install yellow sticky traps near base of
several plants and near the tops of other plants
to monitor invasions of winged aphids, often the
first to enter the garden. As they feed, aphids
exude sticky honeydew that attracts ants that
feed on it. Ants like honeydew so much that they
take the aphids hostage and make them produce
honeydew. Look for columns of ants marching
around plants, and you will find aphids.
Damage: Aphids suck the life-giving sap from
foliage causing leaves to wilt and yellow. When
infestation mounts, you may notice sticky hon¬
eydew excreted by aphids. They prefer to attack
weak, stressed plants. Some species prefer suc¬
culent, new growth, and other aphids like older
foliage or even flower buds. Look for them under

leaves, huddled around branch nodes, and grow¬
ing tips. This pest transports (vectors) bacterium,
fungi, and viruses. Aphids vector more viruses
than any other source. Destructive sooty mold
also grows on honeydew. Any aphid control must
also control ants, if they are present.
Controls: Manually remove small numbers.
Spot-spray small infestations, and control ants.
Introduce predators if problem is persistent.
Cultural and physical control: Manual removal
is easy and works well to kill them. When affixed
to foliage-sucking out fluid-aphids are unable to
move and easy to crush with fingers or sponges
dipped in an insecticidal solution.
Biological: Lacewings, Chn/soperla species, are
the most effective and available predators for
aphids. Release one to 20 lacewings per plant,
depending on infestation level, as soon as aphids
appear. Repeat every month. Eggs take a few
days to hatch into larvae that exterminate aphids.
Gall-midge, Aphidoletes aphidimyz, is available
under the trade name Aphidend; parasitic wasp,
Aphidius matricaria, is available commercially as
Aphidpar.
Ladybugs also work well to exterminate aphids.
Adults are easily obtained at many retail nurser¬
ies during the summer months. The only draw¬
back to ladybugs is their attraction to the HID
lamp-release about 50 ladybugs per plant, at
least half of them will fly directly into the HID, hit
the hot bulb, and buzz to their death. Within one
or two weeks all the ladybugs will fall victim to
the lamp, requiring frequent replenishment.
Verticillium lecanii (fungus)-available under
the trade name of VertaIec®-is very aphid spe¬
cific and effective.
Control ants by mixing borax hand soap or
borax powder with powdered sugar. Ants eat
the sweet mix and borax kills them. They excrete
sweet borax mix in the nest where other ants eat
the feces and die.
Sprays: Homemade and insecticidal soap
sprays are very effective. Apply two or three
times at five- to ten-day intervals. Pyrethrum
(aerosol) applied two to three times at five- to
ten-day intervals.

Bees and Wasps
Identify: Bees and wasps that sting are usually
from a half inch (1.5 cm) to more than an inch (3
cm) long. Most have yellow stripes around their

Chapter FOURTEEN
bodies and others have none.
They are especially attract¬
ed to indoor gardens when
weather cools outdoors- they
move right in.
Damage: They cause no
damage to plants but can
become a nuisance in grow
rooms and hurt like hell
when they sting.
Controls: Occasionally a
problem indoors, bees and
wasps are most efficiently
controlled with sprays.

Cultural and physical con¬
trol: They enter grow rooms

Controls: Seldom a problem indoors. Borers
often cause so much damage on a particular
stem that it has to be removed and destroyed.
Cultural and physical control: Handpick all

Install more circulation fans to make flying diffi¬
cult. Wasp traps, sweet flypaper, and Tanglefoot™

attracted to the hot HID and fly into it and die.
Biological: Unnecessary.
Sprays:
Pyrethrum is recommended. Stuff
small nests into a wide-mouthed jar-do it at
night when the wasps are quiet-and place the jar
in a freezer for a few hours. Use Sevin, Carbaryl,
only if there is a problem with a wasp nest.

Caterpillars and loopers leave plenty of drop¬
pings on the plant. The droppings accumulate in
between buds. Droppings fall out when the buds
are hung to dry; inspect below the hung buds to
find the poop droppings.
Identify: From half inch to four inches (1.5-10
cm), caterpillars and loopers are cylindrical with
feet, often green, but can be virtually any color

Beetle Borers
Identify: Larvae from several boring beetles
tunnel or bore into stems and roots. Look for their
entry hole and dead growth on either side of the
entry hole along the main stem, often discolored
and accompanied by sawdust. Borers are more
common outdoors than indoors.
Damage: Tunnels inside the stem and roots;

butterfly-and are most common when prevalent
outdoors. One way to check for caterpillars and
loopers is to spray one plant with pyrethrum
aerosol spray and shake the plant afterward.
The spray has a quick knockout effect, and most
caterpillars will fall from the plant.
Damage: These munching critters chew and eat
pieces of foliage and leave telltale bites in leaves.
Some caterpillars will roll themselves inside
leaves. An infestation of caterpillars or leafhoppers will damage foliage and slow growth, even¬
tually defoliating, stunting, and killing a plant.
Cultural and physical control: Manually
remove.

dier bug (Podisus maculiventris Podibug®).

Cocoon attached to leaf.

inch (3 mm) long, wedge-shaped insects that are
usually green, white, or yellow. Many species have
minute stripes on wings and bodies. Their wings
peak like roof rafters when not in use. Leafhoppers
suck plant sap for food and exude sticky honeydew
as a by-product. Spittlebug and leafhopper larvae
wrap themselves in foliage and envelop them¬
selves in a saliva-like liquid, plant sap.
Damage: Stippling (spotting) similar to that
caused by spider mites and thrips on foliage.
Leaves and plant lose vigor, and in severe cases
death could result.
Cultural and physical Control: Cleanliness!
Black light traps are attractive to potato beetles.
Biological: The fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, is commercially available under the trade
name Metaquino®.
Sprays: Pyrethrum, rotenone, sabadilla.

Loopers arch their body upward to move forward.

Leaf Miner
Identify: Adult leaf miner flies lay eggs that

from white to black. Caterpillars have sets of feet
the entire length of the body, while loopers have
two sets of feet at either end of the body. Loopers
place their front feet forward, arch their body
upward in the middle, and pull their rear sets
of legs forward. Some have stripes, spots, and
other designs that provide camouflage. Seldom a
problem indoors, caterpillars and loopers are in
a life stage-between a larva and a flying moth or

362

hatch into one-eighth-inch (0.25 mm) long
(green or black) maggots. You seldom see the
maggots before you see the leaf damage they
create when they tunnel through leaf tissue. Leaf
miners are more common in greenhouses and
outdoors than indoors.
Damage: The tiny maggots burrow between
leaf surfaces, leaving a telltale whitish-tunnel out¬
line. The damage usually occurs on or in young

supple growth. It is seldom fatal, unless left
unchecked. Damage causes plant growth to slow,
and if left unchecked, flowering is prolonged and
buds are small. In rare cases the damage is fatal.
Wound damage encourages disease.
Controls: These pests cause little problem to
indoor crops. The most efficient and effective
control is to remove and dispose of damaged foli¬
age, which includes the rogue maggot, or to use
the cultural and physical control listed below.
Cultural and physical control: Smash the little
maggot trapped within the leaf with your fin¬
gers. If the infestation is severe, smash all larvae
possible and remove severely infested leaves.
Compost or burn infested leaves. Install yellow
sticky traps to capture adults.
Biological: Branchid Wasp (Dacnusa sibirica),
chalcid wasp (Diglyphus isaea), parasitic wasp
0Opius pallipes).
Sprays: Repel with neem oil and pyrethrum
sprays. Maggots are protected within tunnels, and
sprays are often ineffective. Hemp Diseases and
Pests suggests to water plants with a 0.5 percent
solution of neem. This solution works fast and
stays on plants for four weeks after application.

Fungus Gnat

Leaf miner larvae burrow in the leaf. They cause
few problems indoors and are most common
outdoors in spring and early summer. Kill them
by smashing them between your fingers.

Identify: Maggots, larvae, grow to 4-5 mm long
and have translucent bodies with black heads.
Winged adult gnats are gray to black, 2-4 mm
long, with long legs. Look for them around the
base of plants in soil and soilless gardens. They
love the moist, dank environments in rockwool
and the environment created in NFT-type hydro¬
ponic gardens. Adult females lay about 200 eggs
every week to ten days.
Damage: Infests growing medium and roots
near the surface. They eat fine root hairs and
scar larger roots, causing plants to lose vigor and
foliage to pale. Root wounds invite wilt fungi
like Fusarium or Pythium especially if plants are
nutrient-stressed and growing in soggy condi¬
tions. Maggots prefer to consume dead or decay¬
ing, soggy plant material; they also eat green
algae growing in soggy conditions. Adults and
larvae can get out of control quickly, especially
in hydroponic systems with very moist growing
mediums. The adult gnats stick to resinous buds
like flypaper! The gnats are very difficult to clean
from the buds.

Microscopic fungus gnats are difficult to see with
the naked eye.

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The mdoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER'S BIBL
Sprays: Apply neem or insecticidal soap as a
soil-drench.

Mealybugs and Scales
Mealybugs:
Identify: Somewhat common indoors, these
0.08-0.2 inch (2-7 mm) oblong, waxy-white
insects move very little, mature slowly, and live in
colonies that are usually located at stem joints.
Like aphids, mealybugs excrete sticky honeydew.

Scales:

Scale affix themselves to stems and foliage. They
are a minor problem indoors and outdoors.

This nematode attacked the stem. Most often
nematodes attack roots. Large knots grow where
nematodes damage both roots and stems.
Controls: The easiest way to control these pests
is with Vectobac®, Gnatrol®, and Bactimos®, all
contain Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti). This strain of Bt controls the maggots; unfortu¬
nately, it is available only in large one-gallon (3.8
L) containers. Difficult to find at garden centers,
check hydroponic stores.
Cultural and physical control: Do not overwa¬
ter, and keep ambient humidity low. Do not let
growing medium remain soggy. Cover growing
medium so green algae won't grow. Yellow sticky
traps placed horizontally 1-2 inches (3-6 cm)
over growing medium catches adults.
Biological: The aforementioned Bt-i works
best. Alternatives include the predatory soil mite
(Hypoaspis (Geolaelapumites) and the nema¬
tode (Steinernema feltiae).

As uncommon indoors as mealybugs, scale
looks and acts similar to mealybugs but is usually
more round than oblong. Scales may be white,
yellow, brown, gray, or black. Their hard protec¬
tive shell is 0.08-0.15 inch (2-4 mm) across.
Mealybugs rarely or never move. Check for them
around stem joints where they live in colonies.
Scales sometimes excrete sticky honeydew.
Damage: These pests suck sap from plants
which causes growth to slow. They also exude
sticky honeydew as a by-product of their diet
of plant sap which encourages sooty mold and
draws ants that eat the honeydew.
Controls: These pests present little problem
to indoor growers. The easiest and most efficient
control is listed under Cultural and physical
below.
Cultural and physical control: Manual removal
is somewhat tedious but very effective. Wet a
Q-Tip in rubbing alcohol and wash scale away. A
small knife, fingernails, or tweezers may also be
necessary to scrape and pluck the tightly affixed
mealybugs and scales after they are Q-Tipped
with alcohol.
Biological: There are numerous species of
mealybugs and scales. Each has natural preda¬
tors including species of ladybeetles (ladybugs)
and parasitic and predatory wasps. There are so
many species of each that it would be exhaustive
to list them here. For more specific information
see Hemp Diseases and Pests.
Sprays: Homemade sprays that contain rubbing
alcohol, nicotine, and soaps all kill these pests.
Insecticidal soap, pyrethrum, and neem oil are all
recommended.

Nematodes
Identify: Of the hundreds and thousands of
species of microscopic nematodes-sometimes,
big ones are called eelworms-a few are destruc¬
tive to plants. Most often nematodes attack roots

FOURTEEN
and are found in the soil; however, a few nema¬
todes attack stems and foliage. Root nematodes
can often be seen in and around roots with the
help of a 30X microscope. Often growers just
diagnose the damage caused by destructive
nematodes rather than actually seeing them.
Damage: Slow growth, leaf chlorosis, wilting
several hours during daylight hours from lack of
fluid flow-symptoms can be difficult to discern
from nitrogen deficiency. Root damage is often
severe by the time they are examined. Root knot
nematodes are some of the worst. They cause
roots to swell with galls. Other nematodes scrape
and cut roots, compounded by fungal attacks.
Roots turn soft and mushy.
Cultural and physical control: Cleanliness!
Use new, sterilized potting soil or soilless mix to
exclude nematodes' entrance. Nematodes rarely
cause problems indoors in clean grow rooms.
Biological: French marigolds, Tagetes patula,
repels soil nematodes, fungus (Myrothecium verrucaria, trade name DeTera ES®)
Sprays: Neem used as a soil-drench.

Root Maggot
Identify: Both the seed corn maggot and the
cabbage maggot attack cannabis roots. The seed
corn maggot is 1.5 to 2 inches (5-6 cm) long. The
seed corn maggot converts into a fly and is a bit
smaller than a common housefly. Cabbage mag¬
gots are 0.3 inch (1 cm) long, and the adult fly
is bigger than a housefly. These pests winter over
in the soil and live in unclean soil. In the spring,
they emerge as adult flies and soon lay eggs in
the soil at the base of young plants. The squirmy,
whitish larvae hatch several days later with a
ravenous appetite.
Damage: Root maggots chew and burrow into
stems and roots. The seed corn maggot attacks
seeds and seedling roots. Cabbage maggots
attack roots, leaving hollowed out channels and
holes in larger roots. Both maggots destroy small
hairlike feeder roots. Wounds made by the root
maggots also foster soft rot and fungal diseases.
Cultural and physical control: Cleanliness!
Use fresh, new store-bought soil when planting
in containers. Cover seedlings with Agronet® to
exclude flies, and plant late in the year to avoid
most adult flies. Place a collar 18-inch (45 cm)
of foam rubber around the base of the plant to
exclude flies.

PESTS & DISEASES

Root knot nematodes cause roots to develop
lumps. Fluid flow from roots causes impaired
growth.
Biological: Control with parasitic nematodes,
Steinernema feltiae or Heterorhabditis bacteriophora.
Sprays: Kill root maggots with neem and horti¬
cultural oil used as a soil-drench.

Slugs and Snails
Identify: Slugs and snails are soft, slimy white,
dark, or yellow, and occasionally striped. They are
0.25-3 inches (1-9 cm) long. Snails live in a circu¬
lar shell, slugs do not. They hide by day and feed
at night. Slugs and snails leave a slimy, silvery
trail of mucus in their wake. They lay translucent
eggs that hatch in about a month. They reproduce
prolifically, and the young mollusks often eat rela¬
tively more than adults.
Damage: They make holes in leaves often with
a weblike appearance. They will eat almost any
vegetation, roots included. These creatures winter
over in warm, damp locations in most climates.
Slugs and snails especially like tender seedlings.
They will migrate to adjacent gardens in quest
of food.
Cultural and physical control: A clean, dry
perimeter around the garden will make it dif¬
ficult for them to pass. Spotlight and handpick at
night. A thin layer of lime, diatomaceous earth,
or salty beach sand two to six (6-15 cm) inches
wide around individual plants, beds, or the entire
garden will present an impassable barrier. The
lime is not thick enough to alter the pH and will
repel or dissolve pests. To trap, attach short oneinch (3 cm) feet on a wide board and leave it in
the garden. The pests will seek refuge under the
board. Pick up the board every day or two, and

365

HUH
shake the slugs off and step on them.
Poisonous baits usually have metaldahyde as a
base. Confine the bait to a slug hotel. Cut a 1 x
2-inch (3-6 cm) slot in a covered plastic container
to make a slug and snail hotel. Place slug and
snail bait inside the hotel. The hotel must keep
the bait dry and off the soil. In a slug hotel, none
of the poison bait touches the soil, and the bait
is inaccessible to children, pets, and birds. Place
slug and snail hotels in out of the way places.
Natural baits include a mix of jam and water and
beer. If using beer, it must be deep enough to
drown mollusks.
Biological: The predatory snail, Ruminia decollata-available commercially-is yet another way
to combat plant-eating slugs and snails.
Sprays: Young slugs and snails are not attracted
to bait. Spray for young at night or early morning
with a 50 percent ammonia-water solution.

Thrips
Identify: More common in greenhouses than

Slugs and snails cause most damage to seedlings
outdoors. Look for slime trails and holes in leaves
to help identify the pests.

Thrips make light abrasions on leaf surfaces.

366

indoors. These tiny, winged, fast moving little
critters are hard to see but not hard to spot. From
0.04-0.05 inch (1-1.5 mm) long, thrips can be
different colors, including white, gray, and dark
colors, often with petite stripes. Check for them
under leaves by shaking parts of the plant. If there
are many thrips present, they choose to jump and
run rather than fly to safety. But often you will
see them as a herd of specks thundering across
foliage. Females make holes in soft plant tissue
where they deposit eggs that are virtually invisible
to the naked eye. Winged thrips easily migrate
from infested plants to the entire garden.
Damage: Thrips scrape tissue from leaves and
buds, afterward sucking out the plant juices for
food. Stipples-whitish-yellowish specks-appear
on top of leaves; chlorophyll production dimin¬
ishes and leaves become brittle. You will also see
black specks of thrip feces and little thrips. Many
times thrips feed inside flower buds or wrap-up
and distort leaves.
Cultural and physical control: Cleanliness!
Blue or pink sticky traps, misting plants with
water impairs travel. Manual removal works okay
if only a few thrips are present, but they are hard
to catch. Thrips can be very vexing to control once
they get established.
Biological: Predatory mites (Amblyseius cucumen's and Amblyseius barkeri, Neoseiulus cuc-

umeris, Iphiseius degenerans, Neoseiulus barkeri,

mmm

FOURTEEN

PESTS & DISEASES

Euseius hibisci), parasitic wasps (Thripobis semiluteus, Ceranisus menes, Goetheana shakespearei), pirate bugs (Orius species), fungus,
Verticillium lecani, is effective.
Sprays: Homemade sprays such as tobacconicotine base; commercial pyrethrum, synthetic
pyrethrum, insecticidal soap. Apply two to four
times at five- to ten-day intervals.

Whiteflies
identify: The easiest way to check for the little
buggers is to grab a limb and shake it. If there
are any whiteflies, they will fly from under leaves.
Whiteflies look like a small, white moth about
0.04-inch (1 mm) long. Adult whiteflies have
wings. They usually appear near the top of the
weakest plant first. They will move downward on
the plant or fly off to infest another plant. Eggs
are also found on leaf underside, where they are
connected with a small hook.
Damage: Whiteflies, like mites, may cause
white speckles, stipples, on the tops of leaves.
Loss of chlorophyll production and plant vigor
diminishes as infestation progresses.
Cultural and physical control: Mites are dif¬
ficult to remove manually because they fly. Adults
are attracted to the color yellow. To build a whitefly trap similar to flypaper, cover a bright, yellow
object with a sticky substance like Tanglefoot™.
Place the traps on the tops of the pots among the
plants. Traps work very well. When they are full of
insects, toss them out.
Biological: The wasp, Encarisa formosa, is the
most effective whitefly parasite. The small wasps
only attack whiteflies, they do not sting people!
All toxic sprays must be washed completely off
before introducing parasites and predators. Since
the Encarsia formosa is a parasite, about 0.125
inch (3 mm) long, smaller than the whitefly, it
takes them much longer to control or even keep
the whitefly population in check. The parasitic
wasp lays an egg in the whitefly larva that later
hatches and eats the larva alive, from the inside
out-death is slow. If you use them, set them out
at the rate of two or more parasites per plant
as soon as the first whitefly is detected. Repeat
every two to four weeks throughout the life of
the plants.
The
fungus
Verticillium
lecanii
AKA
Cephalosporium lecanii, trade name Mycatal®, is
also very effective in whitefly control.
Sprays: Easily eradicated with natural sprays.

Whiteflies can be seen in between yellowish
aphids. Dark spots are honeydew that has started
to mold.
Before spraying, remove any leaves that have
been over 50 percent damaged and cure with
heat or burn infested foliage. Homemade sprays
applied at five- to ten-day intervals work well.
Insecticidal soap applied at five- to ten-day
intervals. Pyrethrum (aerosol) applied at five- to
ten-day intervals.

Fungi and Diseases
Fungi are very primitive plants and do not
produce chlorophyll, the substance that gives
higher plants their green color. Fungi reproduce
by spreading tiny microscopic spores rather than
seeds. Countless fungal spores are present in the
air at all times. When these microscopic-airborne
spores find the proper conditions, they will settle,
take hold, and start growing. Some fungi, such
as bud-rotting gray mold (Botrytis) are so prolific
that they can spread through an entire crop in
a matter of days! In fact, one grow room was
located near a swamp and Botrytis spores were
omnipresent in the environment. Buds and stems
contracted gray mold quickly and were often
reduced to a wisp-of-powdery-foliage in short
order. The grower lost four consecutive crops.
Finally, the grower moved to greener pastures
and had no trouble with mold. Unsterile, soggy

Wash walls with a five percent bleach solution or
Pinesol® (made from natural pine oil) and apply
paint that contains a fungus-inhibiting agent.
Specially designed paints for damp conditions
contain a fungicide and are attracted by moisture.
When applied to a damp, cracked basement wall,
the paint is drawn into the moist crack. Remove
all mold from the walls by washing it a with
bleach solution before painting with fungusresistant paint. Cleanliness and climate control
are the keys to preventing fungi. Few clean, well
ventilated grow rooms have problems with fungi.
In contrast, every dingy, dank, ill-kept indoor gar¬
den I have seen had fungal problems and yielded
a substandard harvest.
Install a vent fan(s) large enough to remove
moist air quickly and keep humidity at 50 percent
or less. A vent fan is the easiest and least expen¬
sive humidity control device available. C02 gen¬
erators produce humidity-increasing water vapor
as a by-product. Dehumidifiers are relatively
inexpensive, readily available at discount stores,
and do a good job of keeping humidity under
control in enclosed grow rooms. Dehumidifiers
draw extra electricity, and the condensed water
must be removed daily. Wood, coal, and electric
heat all dry and dehumidify the air. Most air con¬
ditioners can be set to a specific humidity level. If
the grow room(s) have a central heating/air-conditioning vent, the vent can be opened to control
temperature and lower humidity.

Control
In general, most fungus does not grow or grows
poorly when relative humidity stays between
40 and 50 percent.
soil, coupled with humid, stagnant air, provides
the environment most fungi need to thrive.
Although there are many different types of fungi,
they are usually prevented with similar methods.

Prevention
Prevention is the first step and the true key to
fungi control. The section "Setting up the Grow
Room" instructs growers to remove anythingcloth curtains, clothes, and other debris-that
might attract, harbor, and spread fungi. Cover
the carpet with white Visqueen® plastic. If mold
should surface on the walls, spray with fungicide.

Prevent fungus by controlling all the factors
contributing to its growth: remove hiding places,
keep room clean, lower humidity to 50 percent,
and keep the air well-circulated. If prevention
proves inadequate and fungi appear, advanced
control measures are necessary. Carefully remove
and destroy dead leaves. Wash your hands after
handling diseased foliage. If the problem attacks
one or a few plants, isolate and treat them sepa¬
rately. Remember, fungi can spread like wildfire
if the conditions are right. If they get a good start
even after all preventive measures are taken, do
not hesitate to take extreme control methods
including spraying the entire garden with the
proper fungicide.

gus that attacks indoor plants and flourishes in
moist temperate climates common to many grow
rooms. Botrytis damage is compounded by humid
(above 50 percent) climates. It starts within the
bud and is difficult to see at the onset-grayishwhitish to bluish-green in color-Botrytis appears
hairlike and similar to laundry lint in moist
climates. As the disease progresses, the foliage
turns somewhat slimy. Damage can also appear
as dark, brownish spots on buds in less humid
environments. Dry to the touch, Bofryf/s-affected
area often crumbles if rubbed. Gray mold attacks
countless other crops, and airborne spores are
present virtually everywhere. While most com¬
monly found attacking dense and swelling flower
buds, it also attacks stems, leaves, and seeds,
causes damping-off, and decomposes dry, stored
bud. It is also transmitted via seeds.
Damage: Watch for single leaves that mysteri¬
ously dry out on the buds. They could be the
telltale signs of a Botrytis attack inside the bud.
Constant observation, especially during the last
two weeks before harvest, is necessary to keep
this disease out of the garden. Flower buds are
quickly reduced to slime in cool, humid condi¬
tions or unsmokable powder in warm, dry rooms.
Botrytis can destroy an entire crop in seven to
ten days if left unchecked. Stem damage-Botrytis
starts on stems and not buds-is less common
indoors. First, stems turn yellow and cankerous
growths develop. The damage causes growth
above the wound to wilt and can cause stems
to fold over. Transported by air, contaminated
hands, and tools, gray mold spreads very quickly
indoors, infecting an entire grow room in less
than a week when conditions are right.
Control: Minimize Botrytis attack incidence with
low humidity (50 percent or less), ample air circu¬
lation, and ventilation. Grow varieties that do not
produce heavy, tightly packed buds that provide

Botrytis, also known as bud mold, attacks both

buds and stems of plants.

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The mdoor/Outdoor MEDICAL
Cultural and physical control: As soon as

Evaporated sulfur in a grow room or greenhouse
stops Botrytis from contaminating plants.

Damping-off attacked this stem at the soil line,
rotting the buried end of the stem.

Botrytis symptoms appear, use alcohol-sterilized
pruners to remove Botrytis-infected buds at least
one inch (3 cm) below the infected area. Some
growers amputate two to four inches (5-10 cm)
below damage to ensure removal. Do not let the
bud or anything that touches it contaminate other
buds and foliage. Remove from the garden and
destroy. Wash your hands and tools after remov¬
ing. Increase temperature to 80°F (26°C) and
lower humidity to below 50 percent. Excessive
nitrogen and phosphorus levels make foliage
tender, so Botrytis can get a foothold. Make sure
pH is around 6 to facilitate calcium uptake. Low
light levels also encourage weak growth and gray
mold attack. Avoid heavy crowding of plants and
keep the light levels bright. Botrytis needs UV
light to complete its life cycle; without UV light
it cannot live. Some varieties seldom fall victim
to gray mold. Many crosses are more resistant
to gray mold than pure indica varieties. Harvest
when resin glands are still translucent. Once
glands turn amber, threat of gray mold increases
substantially.
Biological:
Spray plants with Gliocladium
roseum and Trichoderma species. Prevent damp¬
ing-off with a soil application of Gliocladium and
Trichoderma species. Hemp Diseases and Pests
suggests to experiment with the yeasts Pichia
guilliermondii and Candida oleophila or the bac¬
terium Pseudomonas syringae.
Sprays: Bordeaux mixture keeps early stages of
Botrytis in check as long as it is present on the
foliage. Preventive spraying is advised if in a highrisk area, but spraying buds near harvesttime is
not advised. Seeds are protected from Botrytis
with a coating of Captan. Check with your local
nursery for product recommendations.

Damping-off
Identify: This fungal condition, sometimes
called Pythium wilt, is often found in soil and
growing mediums. It prevents newly sprouted
seeds from emerging, and attacks seedlings caus¬
ing them to rot at the soil line, yeliows foliage
and rots older plants at soil line. It occassionally
attacks rooting cuttings at the soil line, too. It
is caused by different fungal species, including
Botrytis, Pythium, and Fusarium. Once initiated,
damping-off is fatal. At the onset of damping-off,
the stem looses girth at the soil line, weakens,
then grows dark, and finally fluid circulation is
cut, killing the seedling or cutting.

SHEDURTEEN

PESTS & DISEASES

Control:

Damping-off is caused by a combi¬
nation of the following: (1) Fungi are already
present in an unsterile rooting medium; (2)
Overwatering and maintaining a soggy growing
medium; (3) Excessive humidity. The disease
can be avoided by controlling soil moisture.
Overwatering is the biggest cause of damping-off
and the key to prevention. Careful daily scrutiny
of soil will ensure the proper amount of moisture
is available to seeds or cuttings. Start seeds and
root cuttings in a fast-draining, sterile coarse
sand, rockwool, Oasis™, or Jiffy™ cubes, which
are difficult to overwater. Do not place a humid¬
ity tent over sprouted seedlings-a tent can lead
to excessive humidity and damping-off. Cuttings
are less susceptible to damping-off and love a
humidity tent to promote rooting. Keep germina¬
tion temperatures between 70-85°F (21-29°C).
Damping-off is inhibited by bright light; grow
seedlings under the HID rather than fluorescent
bulbs. Keep fertilization to a minimum during the
first couple weeks of growth. Germinate seeds
between clean, fresh paper towels and move
seeds to soil once sprouted. Do not plant seeds
too deeply, cover with soil the depth of the seed.
Use fresh, sterile growing medium and clean pots
to guard against harmful fungus in the soil.
Biological:
Apply Polygangron® (Pythium
oligandrum) granules to soil and seed. Bak Pak®
or Intercept® are applied to the soil and Deny®
or Dagger®-forms of the bacterium Burkholderia
cepacia-are put on the seeds. Epic®, Kodiac®,
Quantum 4000®, Rhizo-Plus®, System 3®, and
Seranade® also suppress many causes of damp¬
ing-off.
Chemical: Dust the seeds with Captan®. Avoid
benomyl fungicide soil drench because it kills
beneficial organisms.

A small, white spot and the beginning of rot at
the soil line are the first visual signs of dampingoff.

Lack of oxygen caused by overwatering impairs
root development along the stem and contributes
to damping-off.

Downy Mildew
Identify: Sometimes called false mildew, downy
mildew affects vegetative and flowering plants.
Young, succulent foliage is a favorite starting
place. Powdery mildew develops in temperatures
below 76°F (26°C).
It appears as whitish-yellow spots on top of
leaves creating pale patches. Grayish mycelium
spawn is on leaf undersides, opposite the pale
patches. Downy mildew can spread very quickly,
causing a lack of vigor and slow growth; leaves
yellow, die back, and drop. The disease is in the
plant system and grows outward. It is often fatal,

Powdery mildew, fuzzy white spots signify the
disease already permeates the entire plant.

spreads quickly, and can wipeout a crop. Avoid
promoting this disease by not crowding plants.
Keep temperatures above 76°F (26°C) and the
humidity below 50 percent.
Control: Cleanliness!
Use sterile growing
medium. Remove and destroy affected plants,
not just foliage.
Biological: Apply Serenade® (Bacillus subtilis).
Bordeaux mixture is also somewhat effective.

Blight
Identify: Blight is a general term that describes
many plant diseases which are caused by fungus,
most often a few weeks before harvest. Signs
of blight include dark, blotchy spots on foliage,
slow growth, sudden yellowing, wilting, and plant
death. Most blights spread quickly through large
areas of plants.
Control: Cleanliness! Use fresh, sterile grow¬
ing medium. Avoid excess nitrogen fertilization.
Avoid blights by keeping plants healthy with the
proper nutrient balance and good drainage to
prevent nutrient buildup.
Biological: Use Serenade® (Bacillus subti¬
lis) against Brown Blight. Use Binab®, BioFungus®, RootShield®, Supresivit®, Trichopel®,
(Trichoderma harzianum) or SoilGuard®
(Trichoderma virens). Use a Bordeaux mixture to
stop fungal blights. Stopping blights in advanced
stages is difficult; the best solution is to remove
diseased plants and destroy them.

Foliar Spots and Fungi
Identify: Leaf and stem fungi, including leaf
spot, attack foliage. Brown, gray, black, or yellow
to white spots or blotches develop on leaves and
stems. Leaves and stems discolor and develop

2

spots that impair plant fluid flow and other life
processes. Spots expand over leaves causing
them to yellow and drop. Growth is slowed, har¬
vest prolonged, and in severe cases, death results.
Leaf spot is the symptomatic name given to many
diseases. These diseases may be caused by bac¬
teria, fungus, and nematodes. Spots or lesions
caused by fungi often develop different colors as
fruiting bodies grow. Leaf spots are often caused
by cold water that was sprayed on plants under a
hot HID. Temperature stress causes the spots that
often develop into a disease.
Control: Cleanliness! Use fresh, sterile growing
medium with each crop. Move HIDs away from
the garden canopy about 30 minutes before
spraying so plants won't be too hot. Do not spray
within four hours of turning the lights off as excess
moisture sits on the foliage and fosters fungal
growth. Do not wet foliage when watering, avoid
overwatering., and lower grow room humidity to
50 percent or less. Check the humidity both day
and night. Employ dry heat to raise the nighttime
temperature to 5-10°F (3-6°C) below the daytime
levels, and keep humidity more constant. Allow
adequate spacing between plants to provide
air circulation. Remove damaged foliage. Avoid
excessive nitrogen application.
Biological: Bordeaux mixture may help keep
leaf spots in check, but it is often phytotoxic when
applied regularly indoors.
Sprays: Bordeaux mixture.

Fusarium Wilt
Identify: Fusarium wilt is most common in
warm grow rooms and greenhouses. Recirculating
nutrient solutions above 75°F (24°C) creates
perfect conditions for Fusarium. The water and
nutrient solution carries this disease with it when
contaminated. Fusarium starts as small spots
on older, lower leaves. Interveinal leaf chlorosis
appears swiftly. Leaf tips may curl before wilt¬
ing and suddenly drying to a crisp. Portions of
the plant or the entire plant will wilt. The entire
process happens so fast that yellow, dead leaves
dangle from branches. This disease starts in the
plant's xylem, the base of the fluid transport sys¬
tem. Plants wilt when fungi plug the fluid flow in
plant tissue. Cut one of the main stems in two,
and look for the telltale reddish-brown color.
Control: Cleanliness! Use fresh, clean growing
medium. Avoid nitrogen overfertilization.
Preventive action is necessary. Keep nutrient
solution below 75°F (24°C). Hydrogen perox-

FOURTEEN
ide infusions will also arrest Fusarium. Always
remove infested plants and destroy.
Biological: Mycostop® (Streptomyces griseoviridis), or Deny®, or Dagger® (Burkholderia
cepacia) and Trichoderma.
Sprays: Treat seeds with chemical fungicides
to eradicate the seed-borne infection. Chemical
fungicides are not effective on foliage.

PESTS & DISEASES
Control: Cleanliness! Prevent this mildew by

and a moist surface on which to grow. These
algae are found growing on moist rockwool and
other growing mediums exposed to light. They
cause little damage but attract fungus gnats and
other critters that damage roots. Once roots have
lesions and abrasions, diseases enter easily.
Control: Cover the moist rockwool and growing
mediums to exclude light. Run an algaecide in
the nutrient solution or water with an algaecide.

avoiding cool, damp, humid, dim grow room
conditions, as well as fluctuating temperatures
and humidity. Low light levels and stale air affect
this disease. Increase air circulation and ventila¬
tion, and make sure light intensity is high. Space
containers far enough apart so air freely flows
between plants. Allow foliage to dry before turn¬
ing off lights. Remove and destroy foliage more
than 50 percent infected. Avoid excess nitrogen.
Copper and sulfur-lime sprays are a good pro¬
phylactic.
Biological Control: Apply Serenade® (Bacillus
subtilis) or spray with a saturation mix of baking
soda and water.
Sprays: Bordeaux mixture may keep this mold
in check. A saturation of baking soda spray dries
to a fine powder on the leaf; the baking soda
changes the surface pH of the leaf to 7, and pow¬
dery mildew cannot grow.

the upper surface of foliage. Growth slows, leaves
yellow, and plants die as the disease advances.

the first symptoms.

a healthy white to light brown. As the rot pro¬
gresses, roots turn darker and darker brown. Leaf
chlorosis is followed by wilting of the older leaves
on the entire plant, and its growth slows. When
severe, rot progresses up to the base of the plant
stock, turning it dark. Root rot is most common
when roots are deprived of oxygen and stand in
un-aerated water. Soil pests that cut, suck, and
chew roots create openings for rotting diseases
to enter. Inspect roots with a 10X magnifying
glass for signs of pest damage.
Control: Cleanliness! Use fresh, sterile growing
medium. Make sure calcium levels are adequate,
and do not overfertilize with nitrogen. Keep pH
above 6.5 in soil and about 6.0 in hydroponic
mediums to lower disease occurrence. Control
any insects, fungi, bacteria, etc., that eat roots.

aphids, mealybugs, scale, whiteflies, etc. Sooty
mold is only a problem on indoor plants when
honeydew is present. Sooty mold restricts plant

Control: Remove insects that excrete honey¬
dew. Once honeydew is controlled, mold dies.
Wash away honeydew and mold with a biode¬
gradable soapy solution. Rinse away soapy water
a few hours after applying.

Viruses
Identify: Viruses are still a mystery. They act like
living organisms in some instances and nonliv¬
ing chemicals in other cases. They must enter
plants via wounds. Once a virus takes over plant
cells, it is able to multiply. Viruses are spread by
insects, mites, plants, animals, and human vec¬
tors. Aphids and whiteflies are the worst. Infected
tools also transport viruses from one plant to
another. Typical symptoms of viral infection are:

Spraying
Use only contact sprays approved for edible
fruits and vegetables.

Warning:

Do not use TOXIC SYSTEMIC
CHEMICALS! Read the entire label on all
sprays. The toxic or active life of the spray is
listed on the label. Wait twice as long as the
label recommends, and thoroughly wash
any foliage before ingesting it. Toxic life is
many times longer indoors, because sun¬
light and other natural forces are not able to
break down chemicals.

Sprays are beneficial if not overdone. Every
time a plant is sprayed, the stomata are
clogged and growth slows. At 24-28 hours
after spraying, rinse leaves on both sides
with plain water until it drips from leaves.
Avoid sprays that leave a residua! during the
weeks before harvest. Spraying increases
chances of gray (bud) mold once dense
buds form.

Phytotoxicity is the injury to plants caused
by sprays. Symptoms include burned leaves,
slow growth, or sudden wilt. Spray a test
plant and wait a few days to see if spray
is phytotoxic. Water plants before spraying.
Phytotoxicity is diminished when more liq¬
uid is in foliage.

Temperatures above 68°F (20°C) make virtu¬

Introduction
Hashish is the connoisseur's smoke. Hashish,
also called hash, is the resin heads of glandular
trichomes that are collected, pressed together,
and shaped. The more resin on the input mate¬
rial, the better the hash. Here we will touch on
the basics of making hashish using safe extrac¬
tion methods. I have omitted detailed informa¬
tion on chemical extraction methods using

Resin can be collected by scraping it from your
hands after handling resinous plants or buds. It
can be scraped from tools, too. Resin can be col¬
lected by separating it from foliage and letting it
fall through a sieve. Or it can be separated from
foliage using cold water and sieves.

Male plants contain resin with THC but
much less overall than female plants.
Outdoor plants are subject to wind, rain,
dust, etc., which may prevent resin growth
or cause much of the resin to be knocked
off the plant. Because they live in a pro¬
tected environment, indoor plants are able
to exude as much resin as possible. Such
plants with heavy resin make the best
hash. Great hash comes from the close
trim around the buds.

The Pollinator consists of a drum that turns
inside a box. Cold, dried cannabis is placed
inside the drum that is made from 150-micron
screen. A motor turns the drum, and resin
glands fall through the 150-micron screen as
the cannabis tumbles inside. Resin is collected
below the drum.
Highest quality resin falls through the screen

through the screen when the Pollinator turns for
longer periods of time.
First you must prepare the dry cannabis. Put
it in an airtight bag, and place the bag in the
freezer for two hours. This will make the can¬
nabis hard and brittle, which makes the sieving
process much more efficient and productive.
Let the drum turn for two to five minutes. Use
a short-range kitchen timer to make sure not to
let the drum run too long. As the drum turns,
the purest resin falls through the screen first.
The THC-rich resin falls onto the bottom of the
box underneath the drum.

Fill the drum about half full of dry leaf material
so the cannabis will have enough room to tumble
inside. This action is important to facilitate resin
gland separation from foliage.

Open the lid of the Pollinator, and lift out the
silkscreen drum. Pick up the drum and remove it
from the containing box.

Put the lid back on the drum, and set it back in
the Pollinator. Close the top of the Pollinator, and
turn it on for the first turning period.

they will sink. Water-soluble material dissolves
in liquid, and foliage is lighter than water, which
makes it float!

essential because warm water softens the resin,
which tends to stick together forming an unman¬
ageable lump. The mixture must be stirred
vigorously for several minutes until the lumps
of the powder disperse. Once stirring ceases,
the differing particles in the suspension begin
to separate. Plant particles and other light debris
(such as plant "hairs") float to the surface. Small,
immature resin glands also tend to float. Mature
resin glands and any dense debris such as sand
and mineral dust sink, settling to the bottom."
Sadu Sam and Mila (the Pollinator) are old
friends, and both live in Amsterdam, Holland.
Mila continued to play with the separation

An inexpensive microscope enables a magnified
view of the resin. To grade the resin, make
several batches. The first batch should turn for
two to five minutes, second batch five to six
minutes, and the third more than six minutes.
Inspect each batch of resin with the microscope.

Now the hash is out of the bag! Many manu¬

time and budget will dictate how many bags you
want to use for making water hash.
Use three bags and process the mix twice to
extract virtually all of the THC-rich resin. Keep
the wet plant material from the first water hash

Use a mixer with paddles. If you can, find one

of the Pollinator, in Amsterdam, Holland. This
water extraction process is a simple, efficient
method of extracting THC-packed resin crystals
from cannabis plants. Using the Ice-O-Later is
very easy. Here is a brief recap of the process.
The instructions below are adapted from Mila's
site, www.pollinator.nl where there is much
more information on making hash.

You will need:
Ice-O-Lator set
20-25-liter (5-gallon) bucket with lid

mixing. Do not use the kind with a short chop¬
ping blade.

pounds (2-5 kg) of ice cubes,

enough to keep the temperature down to 41 °F
(5°C)
Keep the temperature of the water just above
freezing at 41 °F (5°C)
Put in the most resinous leaf trim available.
Make sure the chopped cannabis does not
contain stems or other sharp plant parts that
would damage the precision screen. Prepare
buds by pulling apart or cutting into bits before
introducing to the mix.
Fill the bucket with ice-cold water to six
inches (15 cm) below the rim. Put the bags into
the bucket in the proper order. Make sure there
are no air bubbles trapped between the bags
or the bucket. The bags will hang straight down,
nested inside one another and the bucket. Pull
the top edge of each bag over the rim of the
bucket, hold it down and lock it in place with
the drawstring and sliding lock.

for the resin to separate and fall through the
sieves below. When there is too much plant
material in the water, many resin glands adhere
to the foliage.
Add more ice on top of the plant material. This
helps ensure the leaves get wet.
Fill the bucket with more water to within two
inches (5 cm) of the top of the bucket. Let the
mix soak for 15 minutes. Time is needed for the
mass of foliage to become as cold as the water.
The temperature should be about 41 °F (5°C).
Cut two holes in the lid of the bucket-a little
bigger than the shafts of the mixer. Attach the
paddles of the mixer with the top of the lid in
between. Put the lid on the bucket, and turn the
mixer on at a low speed. The mixer will stir the
concoction. Keep the mixer on and let it mix for
15 minutes.
Remove the lid. Use a spoon to move the
plant material on the perimeter to the center.
The goal here is to make sure everything mixes
evenly. Let the mix soak for five minutes longer.
Replace the lid and turn the mixer on again.
Repeat the process until all leaves have been
stirred with cold water. Mila likes to mix it for
about an hour so all the wet trim and leaves are
floating on top of the water.
Turn off the mixer and let the resin settle one
more time for about 15 minutes. Remove the
first bag that contains all the raw material. Close
the top and hang in a place where it can easily
drain. Remove the debris in the bag and turn
it inside out. Run water though the screen to
wash out any latent resin that may have gotten
caught in it.
Cleanliness is of paramount importance from
beginning to end!
Everything that falls in the second bag will
end up in the end product. When cleaning out
the first bag, make sure the crystals do not stick
on the outside of the second bag. Ample water
here is important. Remember, it is a rinsing and
separating operation.

Remove the last bag having the finest screen.
The water will drip out slower than from any
other bag. You may have to hold the bag
between your hands and sift the water back and

all the water because the accumulated hash
slurry in the bottom tends to block the sieve.
This part is fun! You can watch the slurry of hash
congeal as the water drips through the sieve in
the bottom of the bag.
Once the water is gone, the ever-changing

Instructions for a 15-bag kit. The basic
process is the same for each bag. You can add
more or use fewer bags. Make sure to have
everything ready before you start. You will not
have time to look for supplies once you start
this process.

Use fresh-frozen bud trim. You can use large
leaves, but they have little resin.

You will need:
Bags with silkscreens
5-gallon (20-25 L) bucket with lid
Kitchen mixer - Use the kind with paddles for
mixing. Do not use the kind with a short chop¬
ping blade.
Paper towels
Dinner plate
Plastic card
Large mixing spoon
± 4.5-11 pounds (2-5 kg) of ice cubes, enough
to keep the temperature down to 41 °F (5°C).

Fill the bags at least halfway and above the level
of the screens. The screens must be covered with
water before introducing plant matter.

Make sure to have plenty of ice, and do not
add too much cold water before adding ample
ice. Keep the ice mixed with ice-cold water to
make it last longer.

Start First Run
Before you start, remember to clean out
each bag and rinse thoroughly with plenty
of water. This little bit of timely cleanup will
keep gooey resin and debris from clogging
sieves and will avoid laborious scrubbing
(with alcohol) later. Set bags out to dry. To
avoid fungus, make sure the bags are com¬
pletely dry before storing.

Pour in the cold water and ice.

HASH & OIL MAKING

Rub wet, cold leaves between hands to knock off
resin glands into water.

Mix with mixer for 15-20 minutes. Do not let the
mixer's motor or electrical wiring touch water. It
could give you the shock of your life!

Add ice and a bit more cold water to bring the
temperature to about 41°F (5°C).

Periodically rinse the paddles with cold water.

Use a large spoon or flat stick to stir and to sink
the cannabis until it becomes wet. Continue to
stir the mix by hand until completely soaked with
water.

Let the mixed-up slurry sit for 15-20 minutes to
allow resin to settle through screens.

If foam develops, spray and wash away so you
can see what you are doing and prevent foam
from depositing resin and debris on bags.

Pull up the top "work bag," taking care to prevent
unscreened material from falling into the next

Spray water on the foam to burst the bubbles.

Keep the wet leaf. Put it in a bag and freeze.
If the material is good, you can make another

Now it is time for the second run. The second
run is done just like the first, except there is no
foliage to deal with!
Here are the results. We started with 100

Here are the different grades of hash from two runs using 14 bags.
The hash labeled with black letters is first run. Red numbers signify second run.

We loaded up the first run into separate vials; each is labeled with the micron (p) size used to make the
water extraction.

Washing Machine Hash

Once pressed quickly by hand, the hash is ready
to smoke. We tossed it into a bong on top of a
stainless steel screen.

On a recent trip to the tropical region of
Colombia, I was able to record how expert
grower friends made hash in volume. They
learned this technology from Mila. This informa¬
tion is very useful to process the leaf that is left
over after the harvest. Using an everyday wash¬
ing machine will save hours of labor. Following
all the steps and paying attention to the water
temperature in this simple process will extract
all remaining cannabinoids from the leaves.
The best bet is to purchase the proper bags that
have been tested. Mila and other manufacturers
make different bags for outdoor and indoor
crops. Plants grown outdoors have smaller resin
heads than plants grown indoors and require a
smaller mesh bag to collect the resin.

Let's see what happens to this wafer of fresh
hash when we apply a little flame.

Use an everyday heavy-duty washing machine.

Voila! It bubbles, which means it is very pure.

The second test of purity is the amount and color
of ash after the burn. White and clean-pure!

Fill the "zipped" Ice-O-Lator bag with leaf and
place in the washing machine filled with cold
water and ice.

HASH & OIL MAKING

Stuffing bags of cold leaves into the washing
machine takes a little patience.
Drain the hash-laden water and strain through
an Ice-O-Lator bag.

Make sure to include plenty of ice so the mix
stays below 41 °F (5°C).
Remove large Ice-O-Lator bag from the container.

Turn the machine on and let it agitate for 12
minutes to knock loose and separate resin glands
from foliage.

Squeeze excess water from the large Ice-O-Lator
bag.

Dry the wet resin.

The dried resin.

Once dry, Colombian hash makers rolled and pressed the hash into
a beautiful ball.

A washing machine filled
with cold water is used to agi¬
tate the leaf and glands that
are located inside of a zipped
silkscreen Ice-O-Lator bag. This
process separates the resin
glands from the green leafy
material. Once separated, resin
glands fall through the sieve
into the washing machine
water. The leafy material stays
inside the bag. The hash-laden
water is evacuated out the
washing machine's drain hose
and separated from the water
in a simple filtering process.
The machine is filled with
ice and ice-cold water. Cold
water is used to keep the
resin glands intact and facili¬
tate separation from the leaf.
The principle is simple. Resin
is oil-based and leaf is waterbased.
First, the Colombians place
paper bags of 500 grams of
leaf in the freezer for one and
a half hours. Cold tempera¬
tures make the leaves brittle,
which allows them to eas¬
ily separate from the resin
glands.
Next, the two, one-pound
(450 gm) bags of the cold
leaves are loaded into a zipped
!ce-0-Lator bag. The drum of
the washing machine is filled
with very cold water. Chunks
of ice the size of your fist are
added to the water until the
desired temperature of 41 °F
(5°C) is achieved.
Two zipped Ice-O-Lator bags
are loaded into the drum and
the machine turned on to agi¬
tate for 10-12 minutes. Two

bags are used to keep the machine in balance.
As the machine agitates the bags, resin glands
slip out through the mesh of the bags into the
water.
The next step is to evacuate the resin-laden
water out the drain. The drain water is sifted
through an Ice-O-Lator bag to remove any
remaining leaf. The water is collected in a larger
bag placed in a large container. Once all the
water is evacuated, they lift the large bag from
the container. The "clean" water flowed out the
sieve in the bottom of the big bag, and the wet
resin stayed in the big bag. They squeeze the
iast of the water by hand out of the big IceO-Lator bag and the resulting unpressed hash
is set out to dry. Every one-kilo bag of leaves
yields 30-40 grams of dried resin. In a single 14hour day they can process 100 kilos of leaf and
transform it into three kilos of quality resin that
is later pressed into hash.

Resin Extraction for Cooking
Cannabis butter and oil are simple to make.
Each takes a little time to make, but large
batches can be processed and stored in the
refrigerator or freezer.
The psychoactive cannabinoids dissolve in
butter, cooking oil, or alcohol (see "Tinctures"
below). Dissolving the resin in the butter, oil,
or alcohol makes it available for absorption by
the body. Cannabis butter contains about 80
percent of the cannabinoids that were in the
original foliage used to make it.
Heat 1.6 quarts (1.5 L) of water in a large pan
on the stove. Add 4 ounces (112 gm) of mari¬
juana leaf, one pound of butter (or margarine)
and stir.
Bring the liquid to a boil. Put the lid on the
pot and simmer two hours on low heat, stirring
occasionally.
Strain the mix through a colander, catching
the liquid below. Press the wet foliage to get all
the liquid out.
Pour 0.5 quart (0.5 L) of boiling water over the
wet leaf to wash out remaining butter. Press the
leaves to squeeze out all the liquid possible.

Let the mix stand and cool. Within an hour
or two, the mix will separate-water on the
bottom and cannabis butter on top. You can
speed the process by placing the hot mix into
the refrigerator.
Pour off and discard the water, and retain the
cannabis butter.
Use the butter in any recipe that calls for but¬
ter. Use small portions until you are familiar with
dosage and effects. Be careful when consuming;
the butter is quite potent!
Cannabis vegetable oil is made very much like
cannabis butter.
First, you substitute one quart (1 L) of veg¬
etable oil instead of butter.
Heat 1.6 quarts (1.5 L) of water in a large
pan on the stove. Add 4 ounces (112 gm) of
marijuana leaf, one quart (1 L) of vegetable oil,
and stir.
Bring the liquid to a boil. Put the lid on the
pot, and simmer two hours on low heat, stirring
occasionally.
Strain the mix through a colander, catching
the liquid below. Press the wet foliage to get all
the liquid out.
Pour 0.5 quart (0.5 L) of boiling water over the
wet leaf to wash out remaining oil. Press the
leaves to squeeze out all the liquid possible.
Let the mix stand and cool. Within an hour
or two, the mix will separate. Once completely
separated, put the mix into the freezer. The
water will freeze in 4-6 hours. Pour off the can¬
nabis oil. If you are using olive or peanut oil,
they will coagulate in the freezer and cannot be
poured off. Use a spatula to scrape the oil from
the water.
The oil will liquefy at room temperature. It will
keep for about a month at room temperature.
Keep in the freezer for longer term storage.
Use cannabis oil in recipes as you would any
vegetable oil.

Cannabis Tinctures
Use liquor as a solvent to dissolve resin glands
into a potent cannabis potion. You can use any

liquor, but the higher the percentage of alcohol,
or proof, the quicker and more efficient the
process. You can let the spirits evaporate so the
tincture contains virtually no alcohol.
If you prefer a flavored drink with alcohol, use
Kahlua, Cointreau, Galliano, etc. Just remember,
liqueurs contain a lower percentage of alcohol,
and the extraction process will take longer.
Clean 4 ounces (112 gm) of clean cannabis
leaf in two quarts (about 2 liters) of lukewarm
(90°F [32°C]) water. Stir the leaf and water so
they are well-mixed and the leaf is wet. Keeping
the leaves whole makes them easier to work
with. Strain out the leaves with a colander, let¬
ting the greenish water drain into a receptacle.
This step will wash out much of the green
chlorophyll.
Place the wet foliage in a bowl and cover with
one quart (0.95 L) of 80 proof alcohol of
your choice. Stir the blend until the alcohol and

foliage are well-mixed. Make sure all foliage is
covered with alcohol. Put a lid on the bowl so
the alcohol cannot evaporate, and let it sit for 48
hours.
Take the lid off the bowl, and let the mix sit
uncovered for 12 hours, until about half the
alcohol evaporates.
Stir the brew again so it is well-mixed, and
pour it through a coffee filter into a receptacle.
Use the coffee filter to wring all liquid out of
leaves.
Pour the alcohol through the leaves again, and
wring out the liquid.
You will have about two cups of cannabis tinc¬
ture concentrate that is ready to use. Or you can
boil the mixture down to concentrate it more.
The tincture will have 60 percent or more of the
THC contained in the entire four ounces (112
gm) of raw material.
The tincture can be added to recipes in lieu of
other liquids such as water, wine, etc.
Store concentrated tinctures in a cool, dark
place to avoid early degradation. Heat and light
degrade tinctures quickly. Use the tincture in
one to three months.
Be very careful when you drink the tincture;
it is potent! The buzz is similar to the one you
get when eating cannabis, but it comes on in
less time.
This is a shorthand version of cannabis extrac¬
tion using butter, oil, and alcohol. For more
complete information see the Marijuana Herbal
Cookbook, by Tom Flowers, Flowers Publishing,
1995.

Hash or Cannabis Oil
Hash oil is a concentrate of hash or marijuana
(cannabis oil) that has been dissolved in nasty
hydrocarbon solvents such as ether and alcohol
to extract the THC. Hash and cannabis oil fre¬
quently retain residues from solvents used to
extract the THC. These residues are a health risk.
The oils can be very concentrated and potent.
Honey oil was somewhat popular in America
in the early 1970s. The oil was a translucent
golden-amber color. The oil transformed from
stiff, toffee-like consistency to runny oil when

warmed. Cannabis oils are normally dark in
color because they contain chlorophyll and
other contaminants. Filtering the oil through
charcoal will remove virtually all of the impuri¬
ties.
Hash oil never became super popular because
it is inconvenient to smoke and many users
do not want to be exposed to the health risks
associated with the solvents used for process¬
ing. There are many safe ways to separate the
THC-potent glands from the foliage.
The oil can be wiped on joint papers, ciga¬
rettes, pipe screens, hot knives, etc. A popular
smoking method is to smoke it in an oil pipe,
a stem with a glass bubble on one end. A little
oil is placed inside the glass bubble. When heat
is applied, the THC vaporizes and is inhaled
through the stem.
We do not recommend volatile solvent extrac¬
tion because it requires the use of dangerous
chemical solvents such as isopropyl alcohol,
ethyl alcohol, and white gas.
Cannabis is soaked in the solvent, and the
solvent is removed by evaporation. The resulting
residual is a sludge that contains chlorophyll,
plant waxes, other debris, and cannabinoids.
Isomerization is a chemical resin extraction
process that was very popular in the 1970s and
early 1980s. The process has fallen out of favor
because of the harsh and dangerous chemical
solvents-white gas, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric
acid, etc.-used in the process.
Butane cannabis oil is made by passing butane
gas through chopped cannabis. The butane dis¬
solves the THC and transports it out a drain
where it is collected. The captured butane con¬
tains THC. The butane is evaporated away by
setting the collection container in a pan of warm
water. Once the butane has dissipated com¬
pletely, the residual honey-colored oil is scraped
from the bottom of the collection pan.
Butane hash oil is dangerous to make because
the process involves using a quantity of butane
in an open container. The fumes are toxic and a
small flame or spark could cause the butane to
explode. People who make butane hash should

make it in a well-ventilated or outdoor location.
Jelly hash is a combination of high quality hash
and cannabis oil made from butane extraction.
The typical recipe contains eight parts hash and
one part cannabis oil (AKA hash oil) usually
extracted with butane. Although very strong, the
dark jelly hash has a characteristic sticky, oily
consistency which makes it difficult to handle.
You can find out more about these processes
in Marijuana Chemistry: Genetics, Processing
& Potency, by Michael Starks, Ronin Press,
and Cannabis Alchemy: The Art of Modern
Hashmaking: Methods for Preparation of
Extremely Potent Cannabis Products, by D.
Gold, Ronin Press.

Pressing Hash
Once collected, resin powder is often pressed
to facilitate handling and storage. Bulky resin
powder is awkward to handle. It is easily spilled,
blown away, and contaminated by dust and dirt.
Resin powder is also more difficult to smoke,
especially if no screen is available. Once pressed
into a piece of hash, the resin is easy to handle,
store, transport, and consume. Proper pressing
is essential for storage and to slow decomposi¬
tion.
Pressing ruptures resin glands and warms the
resin, causing many volatile aromatic terpenoids
to release their aromas and flavors.
You can press the resin powder by hand or
with a mechanical device. You can elect to add
heat, a drop or two of water, or alcohol while
pressing to make less-pure hash stick together
in a block.
Mechanical presses must be precise and align
well so pressed hash does not ooze out seams.
When pressed, heat and friction cause the outer
layer of pressed hash to oxidize and turn darker
than the interior. In fact, hash can have a dark
exterior and a blonde interior packed with
creamy resin glands.
Make sure to pre-press water-extracted hash
in a piece of cellophane to contain it and help
get rid of the water. The cellophane will give the
pressed hash a shiny skin.

Pressing Small Amounts of Hash

Remove a few dumps of water-extracted hash
from the glass cone.

Ball up the clumps of resin and work it in the
palm of your hand\ pressing it together with your

By hand pressing, you experience the trans¬
formation of the resin powder into your very
own piece of fragrant, dense hash.
To hand press, collect one to four grams
of resin powder in the palm of your hand
and apply pressure to the powder, working it
between the palms of your hands. Also push
your thumb into your palm full of resin powder
to work it into a piece of hash. Continue this
process for 10-30 minutes until the piece of
hash is completely pliable and whole. Heat
will be generated and help rupture and meld
the resin glands together. Relatively pure resin
powder will congeal faster than less-potent
powders that contain impurities. But a little
vegetable matter and debris gives hash differ¬
ent flavors and more body.
Potent resin powder is a creamy white to
gold in color. Pressing the powder together and
working it in your hands ruptures and oxidizes
resin glands, which makes the mass turn ever
darker.

Bottle Pressing
Press small amounts of resin powder between

drical bottle with warm water and use it as a

If your laminator can control the level of heat,
wonderful! You are now ready to pack hash
for a rainy day!

Mechanical Pressing
Place resin powder in a plastic bag or cello¬
phane wrapper to contain it while pressing. All
the powder will be pressed within the wrap¬
per into a brick or plaque of hash. Poke a few
small holes in the bag before pressing to allow
trapped air to escape. The bag is placed into a
heavy-duty steel mold, and pressure is applied
with a hydraulic jack. Hydraulic jacks have a
capacity from 10-20 tons and are mounted to
heavy-duty steel frames that normally contain
a 100-gram mold.
The pressure exerted to form a cohesive
block is contingent upon the volume of con¬
taminants in the powder. The more pure the
resin powder, the less pressure it takes to form
it into a block.
If your hash was made with water, make sure
it is totally dry before pressing to avoid mold.
Water hash does not react like dry-sieved
hash when pressed. Resin has been melded
together in a different way than dry powder.
Pressing the resin when it is wet will trap
moisture inside the hash. The hash will not dry
completely, and it will not properly gel together
later. It will retain a powdery consistency.
Dry-sieved resin powder will press easily and
stay together under lower pressure when it is
relatively pure. If it is adulterated with impuri-

Chimera is without a doubt one of the most
dedicated and knowledgeable people working
with cannabis today; he brings a passion to
cannabis breeding and research not often seen
in the industry. Founder of Chimera Seeds,
he has produced some excellent varieties of
cannabis including 'C4' 'Frostbite' 'Calizahr' and
'Schnazzleberry'.
Chimera is a well-educated individual, who for
years has tried to understand cannabis and how
it functions in the brain. This path has seen him
through a B Sc. Neuroscience, and post graduate
research in the field of Biotechnology and Plant
Sciences. He works on the cutting edge of
cannabis research, and will certainly bring many
new ideas and technologies to cannabis, over
the years to come.
I am very pleased to present Chimera's
contribution to this book in the form of this
breeding chapter, as he takes the mystery out of
breeding and does a great job of simplifying a
very complex subject. Thanks, Chimera, for your
contributions!

This chapter explains the basic biological
processes of sexual propagation in cannabis
and the formation of a new generation of seed.
Armed with the information in this chapter,
any grower will be able to design and begin a
rudimentary breeding program and create new
generations of seed for future use. These new
populations make up a pool of genetic material
from which superior individual plants can be
selected for production (cloning stock) or for
use in breeding programs. It is difficult for small
growers to breed better varieties than are avail¬
able from premium seed companies; however,
for the many seed-starved growers who reside
in prohibitive societies, making seeds for future
use is often a necessity.
Cannabis can be reproduced asexually or
sexually. Asexual propagation is more com¬
monly referred to as taking cuttings, or cloning.
Branches or growth shoots are removed from
chosen donor plants and induced to form roots

in a separate medium; these rooted cuttings
are then used to plant a uniform crop of geneti¬
cally identical individuals. Most commercial and
many hobby growers propagate their crops
asexually to ensure uniformity in growth, yield,
and consistency of product in their crops. By
planting gardens of genetically identical cuttings
from their favorite preselected mother plants,
growers are able to maintain an even garden
profile, produce a consistent, known quality
and quantity from each plant, and expect that
all plants will mature at the same time. This
ensures the same consistent, quality product
from consecutive crops, as long as the same
high-quality clones are used for each planting.
Gardens propagated solely from clones are the
most productive and consistent.
Sexual propagation is the process in which
male and female sex cells (gametes) from
separate parents unite in the female plant
to form what will eventually mature into a
new, genetically distinct individual. This process
occurs when pollen from a male (staminate)
parent unites with an ovule within the ovary
of a female flower to create an embryo. This
embryo, when mature and fully developed, will
become a seed.
Each seed is genetically unique and contains
some genes from each of its parent plants.
Offspring grown from seed are most often
different in some way from each other, just
as brothers and sisters share some physical
qualities of each of their parents, but are rarely
identical to their parents or siblings. Because
of this variation in plant traits and characters,
breeders are able to use sexual reproduction to
their advantage by crossing different individuals
within a population or family, or hybridizing
unrelated lines and subsequently inbreeding
the progeny. This results in a phenomenon
known as recombination of traits, and it allows
breeders the possibility to recover individuals
with a combination of the positive traits of both
parental lines, all the while selecting plants
that do not express the negative aspects. These
selected plant stocks are then used as a basis to
develop new and improved varieties.

BREEDING

A single male flower on a predominately female
plant will release much pollen.

Female plants grow (white) pistils to attract
male pollen.
415

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The mdoor/Outdoor MEDICAL CRO
Distinguishing between male (staminate)
and female (pistillate) plants is easy. Male
plants are distinguished by the appearance
of "pollen sacks," or anthers, that grow from
branch unions. Anthers look similar to a
cluster of grapes or a collection of miniature
lobster claws growing upwards and inverted
from the branch union. Males typically begin
to produce these flowers one to four weeks
before the females of the same variety, and
often bolt, or stretch, when they enter their
floral development stage. Females can be dis¬
tinguished by the development of two whitish
hairs, or stigmas, which develop as part of
the pistil-the female flower that appears in
branch unions or "nodes."
Cannabis is an interesting species, in that it
is one of the only annual plants that produces
each of the male and female sexual organs
on different individuals. This is a condition
known as dioecy; dioecious plant groups con¬
tain individual plants that are either male (sta¬
minate; stamen bearing) or female (pistillate;
pistil bearing). Dioecy is a hallmark of a crosspollinating species; under normal conditions,
cross-pollinated plants (outcrossers) are only
able to fertilize other individuals, which has
implications we will discuss later.
Although dioecy is most common in
cannabis, monoecious varieties do exist.
Monoecious varieties produce both staminate
and pistillate flowers on the same individual.

These monoecious varieties are mainly used
for hemp seed production, as they generate
the highest yield of seed per acre. Monoecy is
not a desirable trait for drug cultivation, where
seedless cannabis, or sinsemilla, is sought.
Plants exhibiting both staminate and pistil¬
late flowers are most often referred to as
"hermaphrodites" by drug cannabis cultiva¬
tors but are more correctly referred to as
intersex plants. Intersex plants are a problem
for growers who wish to produce seedless
cannabis for consumption; just as seedless
grapes or oranges are more desirable to con¬
sume, the same is true for cannabis. Having
to remove the seeds from cannabis flowers
prior to consumption is an inconvenience,
and burning seeds taste bad and can ruin the
smoking or vaporizing experience. We will
discuss intersex plants in more detail later in
the chapter.

The Creation of a Seed
Cannabis is an anemophilous species; this is
a fancy way of saying that it is wind-pollinated.
Under natural, or wild conditions, male plants
undergo dehiscence (shedding of pollen)
and disperse vast quantities of pollen into the
wind. The pollen travels on air currents and,
by chance, lands on the stigma or style of a
nearby, or not so nearby, pistillate individual.
This is the pollination event. Because pol¬
len from many species floats in the air, and
there is a significant chance that pollen from

a waiting female plant, cannabis
has evolved recognition systems
that insure only species-specific
pollen is able to germinate on
the style and thus fertilize the
female's ovules. There is physi¬
cal and biochemical recognition
between the pollen grain and
the stigmatic surface; together,
these insure species identity.
If the biochemical signal is cor¬
rect and the stigma recognizes
the pollen grain as cannabis,
the pollen grain is hydrated by
a flow of water from the pistil,
and it germinates. Just as a seed
germinates and sends a taproot
into the soil, the pollen grain
germinates and sends a pollen
tube into the stigma and bur¬
rows toward the ovule. Once
the tube reaches the ovary, the
genetic material carried with¬
in pollen is delivered to the
ovule, where it is united with
the genetic material from the
pistillate plant. This fertilization
event occurs and creates what
is to become an embryo. This
embryo grows within a seed
coat, and when fully mature in
four to five weeks, can be plant¬
ed and will blossom into a new
generation of life.

for breeding is a much easi¬

because female plants readily
demonstrate all the traits that
are essentially important to a

these are conflicting interests!).

well as its smoking characteristics. Postharvest

Choosing male plants with desirable charac¬
teristics is not so easy. Males obviously don't
produce female flowers; thus, judging resin
content, flora! stature, smells, etc., is more of an
inferential task-males just don't demonstrate
these characters. Some breeders feel a good
method for choosing a potential male is to
rub the stem with your finger. The idea is if it
exudes a pungent, resinous odor, it may be a
good plant. This is really only a crude measure
of the odor of the candidate. Although it can be
a useful technique, it certainly should not be the
major selection criteria.
The best method for determining a potential
male's contribution as a breeding parent is the
progeny test. Progeny testing is achieved by
taking pollen from a potential breeding male
and using it to make seeds with the chosen
female(s). The resulting seed population is
grown out and examined to determine the
effect of the male on the progeny. Progeny tests
are without doubt the most reliable method for
determining the genetic value of the chosen

male as a contributor to the next generation-a
concept known as combining ability. One draw¬
back of the progeny test is that it takes time to
grow and evaluate the progeny, and the poten¬
tial male plants must be kept alive if they are
to be used again. Sometimes breeders choose
to not keep these males alive, only keeping
the progeny lots that correspond to the better
male plants and destroying the rest. Only the
best-performing males are allowed to make a
genetic contribution to the next generation.
Step Two: Collecting pollen. One branch of
male flowers will supply all the pollen necessary
for small-scale breeders to produce ample seed
for their own use. Strip away other branches to
guard against accidental random pollination,
and to avoid premature pollination, isolate the
male as soon as anthers show. Be considerate
of the fact that airborne pollen can travel miles.
If you brush up against a plant in dehiscence,
pollen will become airborne and travel through¬
out the area.

Neville, founder of the Seed Bank, traveled
the world to find the best cannabis seeds.

.

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER'

Cut a branch of male flowers and place it in a
plastic bag to collect pollen.

Male pollen literally covers this large male leaf.

Just prior to the anther's opening, place a
clean paper or plastic bag over the branch.
Secure the bag at the bottom with a piece
of string or a wire tie to prevent pollen from
escaping. Keep the bag over ihe branch for sev¬
eral days to collect pollen. When enough pollen
seems to have been collected, tap the branch
and shake remaining pollen off into the bag.
Carefully remove spent branch and bag so the
pollen does not escape.
Step Three: Store and protect pollen (option¬
al). Pollen does not have a long shelf life under
natural conditions; it is easily destroyed by high
temperatures and moisture. Pollen can, how¬
ever, be stored in the freezer for several months,
if needed. This is accomplished by carefully
removing the pollen from the collection bag
and subsequently passing it through a screen.
This removes any leaf matter from the anthers
that may have fallen into the bag and contami¬
nated the pollen, causing it to spoil. Wax paper
is placed under the screen, and used to catch
the pollen. The pollen can then be collected
with a sterile scraper, placed in a small coin
envelope or sterile test tube, and placed in the
freezer. Cleanliness counts! Pollen should not
be repeatedly frozen and thawed, which will
decrease its viability.
Step Four: Pollination. Pollination occurs
when pollen comes into contact with the pistil.

in the freezer.

Depending on variety, fresh pistils are ready
to pollinate from two to twelve weeks after
flowering is induced. The more pistils on the
bud at the time of pollination, the more seed
will be produced. Fertile pistils appear turgid
and most often are white or off-white in color.
Pistils that are withered, rust- or brown-colored
are past the point where successful pollination
can occur.
To pollinate, cover the female branch with the
pollen filled bag, and briefly shake the bag to
ensure the pollen comes into contact with as
many pistils as possible. Leave the bag for two
days and nights to ensure thorough pollination.
Be careful not to scatter pollen when removing
the bag, as viable pollen can still become air¬
borne and pollinate any nearby plants. If other
plants are in the garden and are not intended
for pollination, the grower may move target
plants from the main grow area into a separate,
smaller space for pollination. After a couple
days in the pollen chamber with the males,
the female plants are thoroughly sprayed with
water to destroy any remaining pollen, before
they are moved back into the main grow area

where these seeds will mature over the coming
weeks. This practice minimizes the possibility of
pollen fertilizing the rest of the crop, keeping it
seedless as the cultivator requires. To reduce or
eliminate pollen contamination of future seed
crops, make sure to clean the pollination cham¬
ber between each pollen release.
An alternate approach is to use a small paint
brush to "paint" pollen onto the pistils. Dip the
brush in the pollen container and gently brush
the pollen onto the pistils. Again, the breeder
must have a steady hand to ensure pollen
doesn't become airborne during the process.
This technique is perfect if the cultivator only
needs to make a few seeds.

Collect male pollen and put a little on a small
artist's paint brush.

After fertilization, most seeds will be fully ripe
in about six weeks, although some may be
viable earlier. As the seeds mature, they can split
open the calyxes allowing the breeder to see the
development of the seed within. Seeds are ripe
when they are mostly dark brown or grey, wellmottled (tiger striped), and sitting loosely in the
calyx. Green, yellow, or white seeds are almost
always immature and not viable. (Sprinkle them
on your salad or cereal.) To test the ripeness
of the seed crop, you can sample-harvest a
few seeds and try to press them between your
thumb and index finger to test the firmness. If
most of the seeds do not crush with a reason¬
able amount of pressure, it's time to harvest.
If seeds are left on the plant too long, some
may fail out of the buds and germinate on the
growth medium below. This is more common
with sativa-dominant varieties. Indica varieties
typically have more dense flowers, which hold
the seeds more tightly. Breeders must remove
seeds from indicas by crushing and sorting the
seeds from the plant matter.
Seeds are ready to plant immediately, but
the initial germination rates may be low.
Germination rates can be increased by drying
seeds out post harvest, leaving them in a cool,
dark, well-ventilated area for a few weeks, and
then placing them in the refrigerator for one or
two months before sprouting.
Please keep in mind this is only a guideline
intended for small-scale seed production. Any
method where pollen comes into contact with
a pistil will result in seeds. Often breeders and
seedmakers will place multiple males, or mul¬
tiple copies of the same male (clones from a
father donor plant) in the seed production grow

room with their chosen females when creating
seeds. Placing these males in a well-ventilated
room and allowing full release of pollen ensures
the crop will be completely pollinated, and
produces a vast amount of seeds per plant.
Scale the process to suit the number of seeds
you require.

Seed Crop Care
Typically, cannabis growers use a high-phos¬
phorus, low-nitrogen diet during the flowering
cycle. My personal philosophy is to give seed
production plants a complete balanced diet
throughout the seed gestation period, so all
nutrients required for proper development of
the seeds are available. Because most cannabisspecific flowering fertilizers are low on nitrogen,
growers may wish to combine vegetative and
flowering fertilizers to ensure a complete diet for
their seed mothers. Flowering nutrient formulas
often lack certain nutrients, and the gestation

.c

period is not the time to be starving plants of
these needs. Provide a complete diet, and let
the developing seeds have all they need.
I've found that complete, balanced, organicbased soil mixes produce the most healthy, via¬
ble seeds. Organic soils contain various bacterial
populations that break down and digest soil
amendments to make them usable by plants.
'Sterile' salt-fertilizer based soils do not support
these bacterial populations, and while they do
support plant growth, they lack the "alive" qual¬
ity of an organic soil. Many growers agree that
organically grown pot has more flavor and taste
than pot grown on a synthetic salt diet. It could
well be that these organic bacterial populations
provide some benefit to plant health, and thus
produce more mature, healthy, viable seeds.

Young seedlings require a complete balanced diet.

Breeding Terms
In order to have a discussion on breeding,
there are some terms we must learn in order to
fully understand the concepts. There are more
terms defined in the Glossary.
Genetic material is inherited as described
above, in the seed making section, from both
the pollen donor and mother plant. The genetic
material, or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is
coiled into long, X-shaped strands called chro¬
mosomes and stored in the nucleus of every
cell. In cannabis, each individual inherits 10
different chromosomes from the staminate
pollen parent, and 10 different chromosomes
from the seed mother or pistillate parent. The
resulting individual has 20 chromosomes total;
2 copies of each of the 10 chromosomes, or 2
full genomes. This means there are 2 copies of
every gene in the plant, one from the mother
and one from the father. Each and every cell in
the plant has a copy of this unique DNA com¬
pliment. The genetic code is written along the
length of the chromosome strands, and each
gene has a specific location along its length.

Vegetative and flowering plants require the same
fertilizer for good seed development.

Primary Components of a
Breeding Program
1 - Develop a vision or a breeding goal.
Every breeding program should begin by
developing a breeding goal. Why are you trying
to make seed? What are you trying to accom¬
plish by mating these sets of parents? You might
be trying to make a seed population that repre¬
sents the traits of an ideal, or mostly ideal plant
you have previously selected. In the case of the
latter, you might be trying to add new traits to
your mostly ideal plant and incorporate these
new traits into a new seedline. Some may just
want some seeds to plant for next year's crop.
Think of your breeding goal as your final desti¬
nation; the breeding process is the roadmap or
route to get to that goal.

2 - Find or Create Variability.
Finding variable seedlots these days is cer¬
tainly not a difficult task, because very few
breeders take the time to stabilize or fix cer¬
tain traits within a given breeding population
prior to release. Your starting seed stock likely
represents a range of variation for most traits,
depending on the source of your initial starting
material. The sad reality is that most of the seed
industry today focuses more on creating seed
for sale than on developing improved or even
uniform plant stock. As a breeder looking for
germ plasm to work with, this leaves unstable
populations with ample variation for future
selection. If searching for variation, this could be
considered a good thing. However, since truebreeding stable plants are what breeders look
for when choosing stock for their own breeding,
this is a hindrance as well. It is much easier to
breed with true breeding plants because one
can see patterns emerging in a predictable
manner in subsequent generations, and thus
expect reliable, consistent results when hybrid¬

BREEDING
izing known true-breeding parents. This can
only be achieved if the breeder is using truebreeding starting parent stock. Due to the lack
of commercially available true-breeding stock
to work with, serious breeders must stabilize
their initial breeding stock before beginning the
hybridizing or outcrossing phases of their breed¬
ing programs.

3 - Grow and evaluate.
Do just as it says. The more plants you grow,
the more variations you will see. I am repeat¬
edly surprised and even amazed to see new
expression of traits when growing this fabulous
species. Cannabis is an extremely variable and
polymorphic species, many traits have numer¬
ous possible expressions. Growing varied seed
stocks of different heritage (and many of each
population) ensures the breeder a wide array
of phenotypes and combinations of traits for
future selection.
Choosing from as many plants as possible is
always preferable; having a wide and diverse
starting stock assures the highest chances of
finding what you might be looking for. When
selecting from just a few seeds, it's not possible
to assure all plants will be vigorous or show the
traits of interest even if they are seeds of known
quality. Breeders must weed through large
populations of potential plants, and "rogue out"
the undesirable individuals. In any breeding
program, off-types which do not suit the goal
should be removed from the breeding popula¬
tions.
Some recessive traits, especially those con¬
trolled by multiple genes (polygenic traits),
have the potential for phenotypes that are only
apparent in 1 in 100 or even 1 in 1000 plants.
Unless growing many individuals, the breeder
has a very low likelihood of discovering these
phenotypes. All other things being equal, the
breeder who grows the most plants has the
greatest possibility of finding the best breeding
candidates. Testing the final product is a crucial
part of the evaluation process, so get out that
bong or those rolling papers and put all your
hard work to the test!

When planting a large number of seeds, you
will generally find that some plants differ greatly
in regard to certain traits while being otherwise
nearly identical. For example, some plants are

This is an optional part of a breeding program.
Some people breed to create a variety that suits
their specific growing environment and smok¬
ing tastes, without ever intending to profit from
the sale of their work. They just want reliable
seeds for their own planting and future use.
Some are of the opposite extreme; they make
seeds exclusively to sell. These "breeders" do
very little breeding. We refer to them as seed
makers.

ernments and greedy seed-making practices
without improvement or preservation have led
to a genetic bottleneck, a narrowing of the
potentially available breeding stock. Now more
than ever, ethical breeding should be of utmost
concern to cannabis enthusiasts. The species
desperately needs breeders who are willing to
improve populations in their possession, all the
while preserving valuable genetic resources for
future generations of breeders.

Selections and advancements come at a cost
to genetic variability. Breeders often reduce
variability by narrowing the gene pool of that
particular population as a consequence of fixing
traits. The best breeders strive to advance and

Types of Seed Populations
Inbred Line/Pure Line
Some refer to these as IBLs. An inbred line is a
seedlot that has been bred for generations while

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER'S BIBLE
selecting repeatedly for specific traits, to the
point where the population reliably reproduces
the traits under selection in each successive
generation of breeding. These plants are said
to breed true for these characteristics. There is
little or no variation for these traits, which are
thus considered pure. Pure lines make the best
breeding stock as the progeny of crosses using
known pure parental lines have a predictable
outcome in subsequent generations. Inbred
lines are uniform in growth patterns and traits
and are stable genetically-each generation of
inbred seed results in plants similar in most
ways to the previous generation. Pure lines are
homozygous at most alleles.

Hybrids
Hybrids are a product of a cross between
genetically unlike parents. Hybrids retain their
distinctive characters if reproduced asexually but
fail to reproduce these characters completely or
reliably when reproduced sexually. Hybrid cultivars are developed by using available inbred
lines or creating new ones from segregat¬
ing populations, and then coupling selection
with inbreeding for homozygosity, evaluation of
inbreds for combining ability in hybrid combina¬
tions, and subsequent multiplication of selected
inbred lines for hybrid seed production.

There are various types of hybrid
varieties:
FI hybrids (’Northern Lights’ x ’Blueberry’,
’Northern Lights' x ’Haze’, 'Frostbite')
3-way crosses ('Skunk #1 ’ - a cross of (Mexican
x Columbian) x Afghani)
Double cross hybrids (a cross of 2 unrelated
FI hybrids 'Haze' (Afghani x Thai) x (Mexican
x Columbian).

FI hybrid varieties An FI hybrid population is obtained by cross¬
ing two unrelated, true breeding varieties. FI

hybrids are unique in that they are uniform
when grown from seed, but, like all hybrids, are
genetically unstable. If reproduced sexually by
inbreeding within the FI population, the sub¬
sequent generation will be neither uniform nor
similar to the FI generation.
One of the major benefits of FI seed to the
grower is a condition known as hybrid vigor, or
heterosis. Hybrid vigor occurs when the progeny
resultant from crossing the two parental inbred
lines exceed the performance of the parental
lines in some character, or most often in sets of
characters (FI < or > PI or P2).
FI hybrids are often bigger and more robust
and grow faster than either of the parent popu¬
lations used in the creation of the FI popula¬
tion. For example, a ('Skunk# 1' x 'Blueberry')
FI hybrid may grow faster and yield more than
either the pure 'Skunk #T or 'Blueberry' parent
populations. Often, heterosis is apparent as a
tolerance to adverse environmental conditions.
FI seed production has benefits to the breed¬
er or seed-maker, as well as the grower. Truebreeding seed can be easily reproduced by
open-pollination. Most seed companies have
no interest in selling easily reproduced seed.
This is as true of corn as it is of cannabis. Very
few companies that do take the time and effort
to breed stable parent stock release it in a pure
form. Most make and release hybrids, as certain
competitor companies' sole mission is to create
knockoff versions of lines released by those who
have actually taken the time to develop new
true-breeding lines. By releasing only hybrids
of their pure lines, seed banks ensure the cus¬
tomer comes back to buy more of the FI seed
each time they wish to do a new seed planting
of the variety. They also protect the investment
of their long-term breeding effort by removing
the possibility that a competitor will reproduce
their work and sell it as their own.
Unfortunately, breeders of cannabis drug vari¬
eties have no recourse to the law when others
reproduce and market their years of work. Due
to the illegal nature of the plant, drug cannabis
varieties are not protected by the various plant
breeder's rights legislation around the world.

Variety - A subdivision of a kind, group, or
family that is distinct in some characters. Within
the variety, all plants exhibit a set of defined
morphological, physiological, or other chemical
characteristics that differentiate the variety from
all other varieties. The variety must be uniform.
Variations in essential and distinctive characters
are described and characterized by the breeder.
The variety will remain unchanged to a reason¬
able degree of reliability in its essential and dis¬
tinctive characteristics and its uniformity when
reproduced*
Cultivar (abbreviated cv) - A term derived
from "cultivated variety," a population of culti¬
vated plants clearly distinguished by any num¬
ber of morphological, physiological, cytological,
or chemical characteristics. When reproduced
sexually or asexually the population retains its
distinguishing characters*
New selections derived from a cultivar or
variety such that the selection shows sufficient
variation from the parent cultivar to render
it worthy of a name, are to be regarded as a
distinct cultivar.
* Note that the Guidelines for Classifying
Cultivated Plant Populations (1978) stipulate
that variety and cultivar are considered equiva¬
lents.

Strain - Strain is not a scientifically accepted
botanical term, although in the cannabis indus¬
try many use the term when discussing seedlots
for purchase, for lack of a more accurate term.
Strain is a term incorrectly applied to selections
of cultivars or varieties. In the cannabis seed
industry, very few seedlots could be considered
true varieties or cultivars, because they are not
uniform or do not breed true. All plants within
the population do not reproduce the defining
characteristics, and, usually the variations in

BREEDING
the defining characteristics are not described.
Very often, commercially sold seeds are noth¬
ing more than hybrids of hybrids with names,
and there are no defining characteristics of the
"strain." Perhaps "family" or "group" are more
appropriate terms.
Open Pollinated Varieties - Non-hybrid pop¬
ulations reproduced by random pollination
within the variety. All pistillate individuals have
the potential to mate with all staminate indi¬
viduals as the pollen spreads randomly, ensur¬
ing preservation of the genetic diversity within
the breeding population. In cannabis, open
pollination is carried out by planting the breed¬
ing population together in a given plot isolated
from other pollen sources and left to the will
of the wind. To maintain varietal purity, hemp
breeders ensure there is no non-varietal pollen
source within four miles upwind, and one mile
downwind-which should demonstrate just how
far cannabis pollen can travel on the wind.
Heirloom varieties/Heirloom seeds are the
product of many years of selective planting
and seed saving. The original seeds bore a
plant or flower that had particular traits the
grower liked—typically flavor, color, or psychoac¬
tive effect. The grower then saved the seeds
from the desirable plant and repeated the pro¬
cess the next season selecting for similar type
plants. The term "heirloom seeds" came about
because the selection process for some culti¬
vars has been going on for generations, often
passed along within a family and/or shared
with friends.
Heirloom varieties are non-hybrid (open-pol¬
linated). This simply means that they breed
relatively true. Thus, growers can save seeds
from their crops, plant them the following year,
and expect to see offspring that are very much
like the parent generation. Any off-types in
each generation should be rogued out of the
breeding population to keep it pure, as they are
likely the result of pollen contamination from an
external source.
Multi-line - Two or more pure-breeding lines,
which are very similar, but differ in a small part
431

of the overall phenotype (i.e., maturation, dis¬
ease resistance). The varieties are grown and
bred separately but are subsequently mixed
together and sold in the same seed package.
These packs are a benefit to growers if the
grower's given environment is inconsistent from
year to year, or for growers who are experi¬
menting with growing in a new location. For
example, a multi-line may include a slightly
earlier-maturing variety with a slightly more
mold-resistant variety; most other traits are
equivalent in each population. The variations
in performance of each variety with regard to
mold or earliness of maturity ensure that there
will be some harvest even in a year where only
the early varieties finish (as a result of early
rains), or even if mold is more prevalent during
the particular grow season. If a grower is new
to an area, multi-lines may be useful for the
first few years of planting. It is always a shame
to plant a single variety, only to find it is not
suitable for the particular climate, thus wasting
the year of production. The grower may not
reap the highest yield as may be possible from
a single hybrid variety particularly suited to the
climate, but the degree of variation present in
multi-lines helps to ensure at least some plants
are harvested.
Synthetic variety - an interbreeding popula¬
tion derived from intermating a group of spe¬

cific genotypes, each of which were selected
for good combining ability in all possible hybrid
combinations. Subsequent maintenance of the
variety is achieved by open pollination and usu¬
ally involves rounds of recurrent selection over
a series of generations.
Intersexuality Is a trait that can be expressed
due to a multitude of causes, both genetic and
environmental. There are intersex plants which
are strictly genetic; these plants have inherited
a gene that triggers the intersex condition, even
given a perfect growing environment. They pro¬
duce both pistillate and staminate flowers on
the same individual under typical environmen¬
tal conditions. Strict negative selection against
these plants is required by breeders and grow¬
ers in order to eliminate the intersex trait from
the breeding population. Cultivators and breed¬
ers alike have wisely selected against plants that
show the slightest degree of intersexuality. They
know even a single male flower on an other¬
wise female plant can result in the majority of
the crop being pollinated, and thus seeded.
Indoors, where growers attempt to mimic
Mother Nature, plants often undergo stresses
which are not present under natural condi¬
tions. When plants are stressed by being grown
in an inhospitable environment, the typical
expression of characteristics can be altered.
Intersexuality, for example, can also be induced

Intersex plants are often mistakenly called
hermaphrodites.

in cannabis by a grower's influence as a result of
an inconsistent growth environment.
Environmentally stressed female plants have
been known to show the occasional male
flower. Interrupted dark cycles and other types
of stressors can result in the development of
staminate flowers on otherwise pistillate indi¬
viduals. Environmental conditions which may
provoke sexual reversal include an inconsistent
photoperiod, nutrient toxicities and deficien¬
cies, pH issues, or drastically fluctuating tem¬
peratures during the flowering cycle. Females
severely stressed, for any reason, are more
prone to develop a few male flowers. These
stresses cause changes in the levels of a plant
hormone called ethylene.
Ethylene is one of only a few known plant
hormones, and plays many roles in plant devel-

BREEDING
When we previously discussed chromosomes,
we said there were 20 chromsomes in each cell
of the plant. The 10th pair of chromosomes,
the smallest pair, are the sex chromosomes.
Female cannabis plants have two copies of the
X chromosome, therefore their genotype is XX.
Male plants have only 1 copy of the X chromo¬
some, and a Y chromosome instead of a second
X chromosome. The genotype of male plants in
terms of the sex chromosomes is XY.
When pollen is created within the plant, one
of each of the chromosome pairs is packaged
into the cells that develop into pollen. Each pol¬
len grain or ovule contains 10 chromosomes, 1
copy of each pair. When the pollen deposits the
genetic material into the ovule, the 10 chromo¬
somes from the pollen and the ovule unite to
make a total of 20 chromosomes, a full genetic
compliment.

opment across a range of species. In cannabis,
one of ethylene's major roles is its involvement
in the determination of sex. It regulates which
flowers should be produced-stamen or pistil.
We know this because applying high enough
concentrations of ethylene to staminate indi¬
viduals in the flowering cycle results in the
formation of pistils. Conversely, applying ethyl¬
ene-inhibiting agents to pistillate individuals as
they enter flowering results in the formation of
stamens in place of pistils. This practice can be
of use to breeders in the creation of "feminized"
seeds, or all-female (gynoecious) seedlots.
All female seeds are produced by obtaining
pollen from one female individual, and subse¬
quently fertilizing another female plant.

Y

433

This Punnet square shows us that female:
female breeding schemes produce only female
(XX) offspring.
Some growers intentionally use the pollen
from intersex plants to fertilize females. They
have found that the seeds and subsequent
offspring produced from this union will be pre¬
dominately female. The major problem with this
technique is that these plants will have intersex
tendencies. By selecting parent plants that have
intersex tendencies, we ensure that some of
the progeny will also have intersex tendencies.
Using pollen from an intersex or hermaphrodite
plant is an intentional selection for intersexual¬
ity-like begets like.
Some seed companies market "feminized
seeds," which are produced by collecting pollen
from carefully selected, latent, stress-induced
hermaphrodites, and use it to pollinate female
plants. This process is time consuming and
arduous, but yields mostly female plants when
grown without stress. However, under the
stresses that resulted in the intersexuality for
the pollen parent, the progeny will often show
some degree of intersexuality as well. Again, like
begets like.
So how do we get true females (that do not
show any degree of intersexuality under normal
conditions) to produce pollen? Can we get
pollen from female plants that do not show a
degree of intersexuality?
There are hormone treatments, which, when
applied to cannabis, result in the formation of
staminate flowers on otherwise pistillate plants.
To select against the intersex condition, we take
our chosen female breeding candidates and
grow them under stressful conditions that may
lead to the formation of male flowers-irregular
light cycle, high heat, etc. Only plants that resist
intersexuality under these conditions should be
considered as potential breeding parents for
the creation of all-female seed lines. We call
these intersex-resistant plants "true females."
Intentional selection against intersex plants is
the only way to ensure intersex-free offspring.
Clone copies of these pistillate intersex-resis¬

tant plants are then sprayed with our hormone
treatment and placed into the flowering cycle
and allowed to develop stamens. It typically
takes three to five weeks for the plants to enter
dehiscence and shed pollen. True female candi¬
dates that also resist intersexuality under typi¬
cal stresses, are pollinated by pollen obtained
by our hormone-treated, gender-reversed, sta¬
men-bearing female plants. The result is a true
gynoecious population, consisting entirely of
female plants.
An American company, Hybritech, was the first
to introduce an effective ready-to-use hormone
treatment-eliteXelite. This product is no longer
available for public purchase. Another plant
research firm, PG-Solutions, has since devel¬
oped and released a ready-to-use hormone
therapy spray, Stamen-lt!. Stamen-lt! is extreme¬
ly effective in causing gender reversal of pistil¬
late individuals. Some hormone sprays are able
to induce staminate flower formation, but fail to
produce viable pollen in any significant quanti¬
ties. PG-Solutions has developed a formulation
that causes significant pollen production, even
in the most reversal-resistant genotypes. If you
are interested in this technology, check their
website, www.pgsolutions.ca.

Breeding Schemes For CrossPollinated Crops
There are many types of breeding programs,
some more complex than others. Which breed¬
ing method to employ depends entirely on
the breeder's goal. Ideally, potential breeders
understand the benefits and drawbacks of each
strategy, so a suitable strategy can be chosen to
achieve the desired goal. The breeder's personal
preference always comes into play when choos¬
ing a breeding program. Previous successes
may influence a breeder to use one specific
breeding strategy over another. Some breed¬
ers rely heavily on science and statistics when
analyzing the performance of their hybrids or
progeny. Others consider breeding more of an
art, and select based on feeling. Over the course

SIXTEEN

BREEDING

of a breeding program, a breeder will often
use more than one method to achieve various
aspects of the goal.
When breeding cross-pollinators, we discuss
hybrid performance in terms of combining
ability—the ability of an inbred line to give char¬
acteristic performance in hybrid combinations
with other lines. The progenies are tested for
performance as populations and related back
to the parental generation. Some often-used
measures of performance are general combin¬
ing ability (GCA) and specific combining ability
(SCA). General combining ability is the average
or overall performance of a given line in hybrid
combinations open-pollinated with other lines.
Specific combining ability is the performance
of a specific iine, as compared to other lines,
when crossed with the same specific pollen
source.
Open pollination is a very low effort type of
seed production and involves minimal, if any,
selection. Seeds are planted, grown to maturity,
and allowed to interbreed. Off-types, or plants
that do not represent the defining characteris¬
tics of the variety, are rogued from the breeding
population, to ensure the variety remains pure
and true to type. Inbred lines, and other popula¬
tions maintained through open pollination, are
often bred by one person, and then produced
for commercial production and release by oth¬
ers. Some breeders create true-breeding popu¬
lations, then licence them to other companies
who plant them and expand the seed popula¬
tions by growing out many, many plants and
allowing them all to fully seed. This is called a
seed-increase.

Inbreeding
Inbreeding is nothing more than crossing a
group, family, or variety of plants within them¬
selves with no additions of genetic material
from an outside or unrelated population. The
most severe form of inbreeding is the self-cross,
in which only one individual’s genetic mate¬
rial forms the basis of subsequent generations.
1:1 hybrid populations are only slightly less

Inbreeding consists of crossing a group, family, or
variety of plants with themselves.
narrow, derived from the genetic material of
2 individuals. Such tight or narrow breeding
populations lead to a condition called "inbreed¬
ing depression" upon repeated self-breeding or
inbreeding.
Inbreeding depression is a reduction in vigor
(or any other character) due to prolonged
inbreeding. This can manifest as a reduction
in potency or a decrease in yield or rate of
growth. Progress of depression is dependent,
in part, on the breeding system of the crop.
Earlier, when we discussed dioecy, we said
cannabis is an outcrossing or cross-pollinating
species. Cross-pollinated crops usually exhibit a
higher degree of inbreeding depression when
"selfed," or inbred, than do selfing crops. For
example, tomato (an inbreeding or selfing spe¬
cies) can be selfed for 20 generations with no
apparent loss in vigor or yield, whereas some
experiments have shown that the yield of corn
per acre is decreased quite dramatically when

and health of cannabis germplasm. Sadly, this
is the preferred breeding scheme used today by
the majority of commercial seed banks. These
breeders don't realize that cannabis is naturally
an out-crossing or cross-pollinating species and
existed in wild breeding populations of hun¬
dreds if not thousands of individuals. Within
these many individuals lies a wide range of
versions of different genes. When we select only
one or two plants from this vast array as our
breeding population, we drastically reduce the
genetic variability found in the original popula¬
tion (a genetic bottleneck). This variability is lost
from the populations, and unavailable to future
generations.

inbred for 20 generations.
!n cross-pollinated crops, deleterious genes
remain hidden within populations, and the neg¬
ative attributes of these recessive traits can be
revealed or unmasked via continual inbreeding.
Inbreeding depression can be apparent in SI
populations after a single generation of self-fer¬
tilization. When breeding cannabis using small
populations, as is often the case with continual
1:1 mating schemes, inbreeding depression
typically becomes apparent within three to six
generations. To deal with this problem, breeders
often maintain separate parallel breeding lines,
each of which are selected for similar or identi¬
cal sets of traits. After generations of inbreed¬
ing, when each of the inbred lines, or selfed
populations, begin to show inbreeding depres¬
sion, they are hybridized or outcrossed to each
other to restore vigor and eliminate inbreeding
depression while preserving the genetic stability
of the traits under selection.
The vast majority of texts written to date on
the subject of breeding cannabis have espoused
1:1 mating strategies, much to the detriment

Outbreeding
Outbreeding is the process of crossing or
hybridizing plants or groups of plants with other
plants to which there is no, or only a distant,
relation. Any time a breeder is hybridizing using
plants that reside outside of the family, group,
or variety, hybrid seed is produced. For example,
an FI hybrid seed is the first generation off-

spring resulting from a cross of two distinct
true-breeding plants or populations. Each of the
parent populations were hybridized (outcrossed
to each other) to produce the new generation,
which is now comprised of genetics from both
parental populations. Outcrossing results in the
introduction of new and different genetic mate¬
rial to each of the respective pools.
Filial Breeding - A type of breeding system
where siblings of the same progeny lot and gen¬
eration are intermated to produce new genera¬
tions. The first hybrid generation of two distinct
true-breeding lines is denoted the FI genera¬
tion (F, filial). If two FI siblings are bred, or the
FI population is allowed to be open pollinated,
the resulting generation is labeled F2.
Mating siblings chosen from the F2, results in
the F3 population. F4, F5, F6 generations, etc.,
are obtained in the same manner, by crossing
plants of the same generation and progeny lot.
Note that as long as any number of siblings
of a generation (F[n]) are mated, the resulting
generations is denoted (F[n+1 ]).
Filial inbreeding with selection for specific
traits is the most common method for estab¬
lishing a pure or a true-breeding population,
when breeding cross-pollinated species such
as cannabis.
Backcross Breeding - A type of breeding that
involves repeated crossing of progeny with one
of the original parental genotypes; cannabis
breeders most often cross progeny to the moth¬
er plant. This parent is known as the recurrent
parent. The nonrecurrent parent is called the
donor parent. More widely, any time a genera¬
tion is crossed to a previous generation, it is a
form of backcross breeding. Backcross breeding
has become one of the staple methods clan¬
destine cannabis breeders use, mainly because
it is a simple, rapid method when using green¬
houses or growrooms, and requires only small
populations. The principal goal of backcross
breeding is to create a population of individuals
derived mainly from the genetics of one single
parent (the recurrent parent).
The donor parent is chosen based on a trait

Sprayed with 'Stamen-lt!' from PG-Solutions,
this plant that started out as a female is now
expressing only male flowers.
of interest that the recurrent parent lacks; the
idea is to introgress this trait into the backcross
population, such that the new population is
comprised mainly of genetics from the recurrent
parent, but also contains the genes responsible
for the trait of interest from the donor parent.
The backcross method is a suitable scheme
for adding new desirable traits to a mostly
ideal, relatively true-breeding genotype. When
embarking on a backcross breeding plan, the
recurrent parent should be a highly acceptable
or nearly ideal genotype (for example, an exist¬
ing commercial cultivar or inbred line). The ideal
traits considered for introgression into the new
seed line should be simply inherited and easily
scored for phenotype. The best donor parent
must possess the desired trait, but should not
be seriously deficient in other traits. Backcross
line production is repeatable, if the same par¬
ents are used.
Backcross breeding is best used when adding
simply inherited dominant traits that can easily
be identified in the progeny of each generation
(Example 1). Recessive traits are more difficult
to select for in backcross breeding, since their

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER'S Bl

expression is masked by dominance in each
backcross to the recurrent parent. An additional
round of open pollination or sib-mating is need¬
ed after each backcross generation, to expose
homozygous-recessive plants. Individuals show¬
ing the recessive condition are selected from F2
segregating generations and backcrossed to the
recurrent parent (see Example 2).

Step 2 - Select desirable plants showing

Step 3 - Select plants from BC1 and hybridize
with the recurrent parent; the resulting genera¬
tion is denoted BC2.

ize selected F2-recessive plants to the recurrent
parent. The generation produced is denoted
BC1.
Step 4 - Select plants from BC1, and create

a generation of F2 plants via sib-mating; the
resulting generation can be denoted BC1F2.
Step 5 - Select desirable BC1F2 plants show¬
ing the recessive condition, and hybridize with
the recurrent parent; the resulting generation is
denoted BC2.
Step 6 - Select plants from BC2, and create an
F2 population via sib-mating; denote the result¬
ing generation BC2F2.
Step 7 - Select plants showing the recessive
condition from the BC2F2 generation, and
hybridize to the recurrent parent; the resulting
generation is denoted BC3.
Step 8 - Grow out BC3, select and sib-mate
the most ideal candidates to create an F2
population, where plants showing the recessive
condition are then selected and used as a basis
for a new inbred, or open-pollinated, seed line.
This new generation created from the F2 is a
population that consists of, on average, -93.7%
of genes from the recurrent parent, and only
-6.3% of genes leftover from the donor par¬
ent. Most importantly, one should note that
since only homozygous-recessives were chosen
for mating in the BC3F2 generation, the entire
resulting BC3F3 generation is homozygous for
the recessive trait, and breeds true for this reces¬
sive trait. Our new population meets our breed¬
ing objective. It is a population derived mainly
from the genetics of the recurrent parent, yet
breeds true for our introgressed recessive trait.
Backcross-derived lines are expected to be
well-adapted to the environment in which
they will be grown, which is another reason
backcrossing is often used by cannabis breed¬
ers who operate indoors. Indoor grow rooms
are easily replicated all over the world, so the
grower is able to grow the plants in a similar
environment in which they were bred. Progeny
therefore need less extensive field-testing by the
breeder across a wide range of environments.
If two or more characters are to be intro¬
gressed into a new seed line, these would usu¬
ally be tracked in separate backcross programs,
and the individual products would be combined
in a final set of crosses after the new popula-

ter SIXTEEN
tions have been created by backcrossing.
The backcross scheme has specific drawbacks,
however. When the recurrent parent is not very
true-breeding, the resulting backcross genera¬
tions segregate, and many of the traits deemed
desirable to the line fail to be reproduced reli¬
ably. Another limitation of the backcross is that
the "improved" variety differs only slightly from
the recurrent parent (e.g., one trait). If multiple
traits are to be introgressed into the new popu¬
lation, other techniques such as inbreeding or
recurrent selection, may be more rewarding.

Selfing
Selfing is the process of creating seed by
fertilizing a plant with pollen obtained from
itself. The result of a self-cross is a population of
plants that derive from a single individual. The
first generation population derived from selfing
an individual is called the SI population. If an
individual is chosen from the SI, and again
selfed, the resulting population is denoted the
S2 generation. Subsequent generations derived
in the same manner are denoted S3, S4, etc.
Traits for which the plant is homozygous
remain homozygous upon selfing, whereas het¬
erozygous loci segregate, and may demonstrate
novel expressions of these characters.
We know homozygous loci remain homozy¬
gous in future generations upon selfing, but
what about the heterozygous loci? Each selfed
generation leads to an increase in homozygosity
by 50% for each heterozygous locus, and each
subsequent generation, derived from selfing an
SI individual, is 50% more homozygous than
the parent from which it was derived. Repeated
selfing, or single-seed descent, is the fastest way
to achieve homozygosity within a group or fam¬
ily. Again, the more plants grown from a selfed
population, the better probability a breeder has
of finding selfed progeny that show all of the
desired traits.

Single-seed descent - A plant is self-fertil¬
ized and the resulting seed collected. One
of these seeds is selected and grown, again

BREEDING
self-fertilized, and seed produced. All progeny
and future generations have descended from
a single ancestor, as long as no pollen from an
external family is introduced. Each generation
is the result of selfing one individual from the
previous generation.
After six generations of selfing without selec¬
tion, 98.44% of the genes of an individual are
homozygous-this refers to genes, not the num¬
ber of plants that are homozygous.
Recurrent Selection - Any breeding program
designed to concentrate favorable genes scat¬
tered among a number of individuals by repeat¬
ed cycles of selection for favorable traits.
Step 1- Identify superior genotypes for the trait
under selection.
Step 2 - Intermate the superior genotypes and
select improved progeny.
Step 3 - Repeat steps 1 & 2 over a series of
generations.
Pedigree Selection - A system of breeding in
which individual plants are selected in the seg¬
regating generations from a cross on the basis
of their desirability, judged individually, and on
the basis of a pedigree record.
Ploidy - Cannabis plants are, by nature, dip¬
loids with twenty chromosomes. At meiosis,
each parent's gamete contributes ten chro¬
mosomes to the zygote they have formed.
Cannabis cells may be haploid (have 1 copy of
each chromosome set) as in gametes, or diploid
(2 chromosome sets per cell).
Some researchers have wondered whether
triploid, or tetraploid cannabis (cells with either
3 or 4 chromosome sets respectively) are agronomically important. In some species, polyploid
plants grow bigger, yield more, or outperform
typical diploid members of the same species.
Some early reports touted polyploid cannabis as
being more potent. This research was flimsy and
unscientific at best, and ever since this report,
many cannabis growers have attempted induc¬
ing polyploidy in many varieties, none leading
to agronomic success.
Diploid plants are considered normal and
have one set of chromosomes, which occur
439

in pairs within each plant cell. Polyploid plants
have more than one set of chromosomes per
cell. Polyploid plant chromosomes occur in
groups of 3-4 instead of in pairs. Tetraploid
plants groups occur with four chromosomes in
each cell.
At one time, breeders believed that polyploid
and tetraploid plants would produce a superior
resin-packed plant.
The polyploid characteristic can be induced
with an application of colchicine. Just remem¬
ber, colchicine is a poison, and polyploid plants
do not contain more THC-potent resin.

Mutagenesis-Inducing Variation
If variation does not exist for the trait or traits
of interest, or cannot be found in other popula¬
tions, it is theoretically possible to induce varia¬
tion by exposing seeds or other tissues to radia¬
tion, alkylating agents, or other mutagens such
as colchicine or EMS (ethylmethylsulfonate).
These treatments cause changes at the DNA
level that have the remote potential to result in
desirable, novel phenotypes.
There is much rumour and speculation about
this technique amongst breeders and grow¬
ers. It's a common myth that treating seeds
with colchicine and growing the plants results
in more potent cannabis plants. Let's put this
myth to rest; it is completely untrue. While the
possibility does exist on a theoretical level, no
valid experiments have ever shown this to be
true. Potential breeders would be better off
using their time and space for selecting better
plants than trying this technique as a method
for improving plant stock.
That being said, let's take a look at the theory
behind the concept.
Imagine you have a population of plants
which, when grown from seed and inbred
within the population, consistently produces
high-THC plants. It is theoretically possible to
treat many of these seeds with a mutagen, grow
and inbreed the seeds, and find plants in subse¬
quent generations that produce no THC. These
mutagens can destroy genes along a chromo¬

some, and when copies of this chromosome
are inherited by future generations, a new or
"novel" phenotype can appear. In our example,
the no THC condition is the novel phenotype.
These mutations, however, occur at random
and are extremely unreliable. The probability of
finding plants which have a desired mutation in
the gene of interest is very low. A breeder may
treat many thousands of seeds, grow 100,000
plants, and still not see the desired altered
phenotypes. This technique is costly in both
time and space. It is often used in the breeding
of "legal plants" when growing out thousands
of individuals and searching for these novel
phenotypes is not problematic. Performing such
population screens in cannabis is not practical,
especially for clandestine breeders. The poten¬
tially hazardous nature of these mutagenic
agents is another very good reason to choose
other breeding options. Inducing variability is
likely not the best option, at least for the hobby
breeder.
If you are serious about breeding cannabis,
check out Marijuana Botany, An Advanced
Study: The Propagation and Breeding of
Distinctive Cannabis, by Robert Connell Clarke,
Ronin Press. Using understandable scientific
detail, Clarke discusses genetics and breeding,
chemistry, and much more of interest to the
budding breeder. This book is worth its weight

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER'S BIBLE
For example, if you want 1500 ppm and ambi¬
ent C02 is 350 ppm, you will need to add: 1500
ppm minus 350 ppm =1150 ppm C02.
A poorly sealed grow room can have 20
percent leakage which should be added to the
amount of C02 required.
For example, to get the desired 1500 ppm of
C02 for a grow room with 21.6 cubic meters,
add: 21.4 x 1150 = 24.61 liters x 1.2 = 29.53
liters.
This information tells you to set the flow meter
to 6 liters per minute and run the gas for 5
minutes.
Leave the gas-enriched air for 20 minutes and
exhaust the air from the garden room.
