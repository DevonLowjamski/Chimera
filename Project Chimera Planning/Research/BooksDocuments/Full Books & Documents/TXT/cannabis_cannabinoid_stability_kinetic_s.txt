Abstract
This study was undertaken to quantitatively explore the effect of temperature on the degradation of cannabinoids in dried
cannabis flower. A total of 14 cannabinoids were monitored using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry
in temperature environments from −20 to +40 ◦ C lasting up to 1 year. We find that a network of first-order degradation
reactions is well-suited to model the observed changes for all cannabinoids. While most studies focus on high-temperature
effects on the cannabinoids, this study provides high-precision quantitative assessment of room temperature kinetics with
applications to shelf-life predictions and age estimates of cannabis products.

content, we conducted measurements of 14 cannabinoids
