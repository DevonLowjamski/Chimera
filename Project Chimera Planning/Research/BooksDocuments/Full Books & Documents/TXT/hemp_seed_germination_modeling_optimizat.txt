1. Introduction  
ABSTRACT  
In vitro seed germination of cannabis as the first physiological stage in the plant life cycle is not only important  for studying factors affecting cultivation conditions but also crucial for obtaining juvenile tissue as a potential  explant for different in vitro procedures. On the other hand, in vitro seed germination is a multi-variable biological  process that can be influenced by genetic (genotype) and physical factors (medium composition and environ 
mental conditions). Therefore, a powerful mathematical methodology such as artificial neural networks (ANNs)  is well suited to analyze the data and optimize the conditions this complex system. The current study was aimed  to evaluate the effect of different types and concentrations of carbohydrate sources (sucrose and glucose) as well  as different strengths of DKW (Driver and Kuniyaki Walnut) and mMS (Murashige and Skoog Medium, Van der  Salm modification) media on seed germination indices as well as morphological features of in vitro-grown  cannabis seedlings by using three ANNs including multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF), and  generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The GRNN model displayed higher predictive accuracy (r2>0.70)  in both training and testing sets for all germination indices and morphological traits in comparison to RBF or  MLP. Moreover, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was subjected to the GRNN to find the  optimal type and level of media and carbohydrate source for obtaining the best seed germination indices  (germination rate and mean germination time). According to the optimization process, 0.43 strength mMS  medium supplemented with 2.3 % sucrose would result in the best outcomes. This result showed that a moderate  level of salts existing in culture media (0.43 strength of mMS medium) supplemented with a moderate level of  sucrose (2.3 %) can improve in vitro seed germination of hemp. The results of a validation experiment revealed  that there was a negligible difference between the experimental data and the optimized result. Therefore, GRNN NSGA-II provided an accurate prediction of seed germination and can likely be employed to optimize different  factors involved in in vitro culture of this multi-purpose crop.

Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is cultivated in many parts of the world for  oil, fiber, seeds and its medicinal values (Kovalchuk et al., 2020; Salami  et al., 2020). There is an exponential increase in demanding the products  of cannabis all over the world, including a multi-billion dollar market for  non-psychoactive cannabinoids that can be obtained from industrial  hemp (Monthony et al., 2021). However, studies on this multipurpose  crop are lacking and biotechnological methods are in their infancy due  to the long history of prohibition (Hesami et al., 2020c). Plant tissue  culture is an important agricultural biotechnology that provides the  production of crops with improved food, fuel, fiber, and feed

genomics, and genetic manipulation (Hurgobin et al., 2020). To study in  vitro functional genomics or genetic manipulation and secondary  metabolite production via callus culture, juvenile tissues and organs  such as different parts of in vitro-growing seedling have been recom 
mended as a potential explant material (Deguchi et al., 2020; Ioannidis  et al., 2020; Sorokin et al., 2020). Thus, efficient seed germination  protocol to provide in vitro-grown seedlings can play a conspicuous role  in successful cannabis genetic manipulation and regeneration. More 
over, seed germination can be considered as the first and most important  physiological stage in the plant life cycle (Hu et al., 2018). Therefore,  successful seed germination is not only important for studying factors  affecting cultivation conditions, but also crucial for obtaining juvenile  tissue as a potential explant for different in vitro procedures (e. g. gene  transformation, callus culture, secondary metabolite and biofuel pro 
duction) and for screening stress-tolerant genotypes (Hu et al., 2018;  Sorokin et al., 2021). In an ex vitro study, Hu et al. (2018) investigated  the effect of different concentrations of various salts (NaCl, Na2CO3,  Na2SO4, and NaHCO3) on seed germination of two hemp cultivars and  reported that a low level of salts improved seed germination rate,  resulted in longer hypocotyls and radicles in comparison with a high  concentration of salts. They also showed that the quality of seedlings  was more sensitive to salt concentrations than seed germination rate and  that seed germination indices of hemp could be different with the type  and concentration of salts. These results show the importance of  studying the type and concentration of salts on seed germination, but to  the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive studies exist concerning in  vitro cannabis seed germination where salts are typically included in the  culture medium.  
In vitro seed germination is a multi-variable biological process  (Genze et al., 2020) that can be influenced by genetic (genotype) and  physical factors such as type and concentrations of plant growth regu lators, carbon sources, gelling agent, medium composition, disinfection  procedure, as well as light, pH, and temperature (Fig. 1) (Hesami and  Jones, 2020; Roni et al., 2018). Among these factors, medium  
composition (e.g., type and concentration of salts and vitamins), car bohydrate sources, and their interaction play a pivotal role. Previous  studies showed that the high concentration of media (full strength me dium) can inhibit seed germination in many species (Bozdemir et al.,  2018; Huh et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017). Also, different studies showed  that each plant needs specific medium composition (salts and vitamins)  and carbohydrate source for optimal germination (Roni et al., 2018;  Stewart and Kane, 2010; Sumaryono et al., 2012). For instance, Knudson  (1922) showed that orchid seed requires a specific culture medium  supplemented with sucrose as a simple carbohydrate source for in vitro  germination. In another study, Sumaryono et al. (2012) studied the ef fect of different strengths of MS medium along with different concen trations and types of carbohydrates for in vitro growth of Metroxylon sagu  seedlings. They reported that half-strength MS medium along with 30  g/l sucrose resulted in the highest performance and growth of the  seedlings. Generally, it has been suggested that the type and strength of  media as well as carbohydrate sources should be adjusted for each plant  (Roni et al., 2018; Stewart and Kane, 2010; Sumaryono et al., 2012). As  a non-linear and complex biological process, conventional statistical  approaches such as simple regression is not suitable for studying and  analyzing in vitro seed germination due to the number of treatments that  would be required (Niazian and Niedbała, 2020). New non-linear  computational approaches have great potential to optimize the process  with minimal treatments.  
Machine learning algorithms have been successfully employed for  predicting and optimizing various complex biological systems (Hesami  et al., 2021; Niazian and Niedbała, 2020; Silva et al., 2019; Yoosefzadeh  Najafabadi et al., 2021). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be  considered as the most well-known models among different machine  learning algorithms (Jafari and Shahsavar, 2020; Kusumo et al., 2017;  Sebayang et al., 2017). The usefulness and reliability of ANNs in  studying and predicting different steps of plant tissue culture such as in  vitro sterilization, callogenesis, shoot proliferation, and in vitro produc tion of secondary metabolites have been recently confirmed (Farhadi  et al., 2020; Hesami and Jones, 2020; Salehi et al., 2020, 2021). Genetic  algorithm (GA) is a well-known single objective optimization algorithm  that has been previously been applied for optimizing different in vitro  processes (Hesami and Jones, 2020; Salehi et al., 2020). However, as a  single objective optimization algorithm, it can only find the optimal  level of inputs for each individual target variable separately and cannot  optimize the level of inputs for all target variables simultaneously  (Bozorg-Haddad et al., 2016; Hesami et al., 2020b; Tanabe and Ishi buchi, 2020; Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi et al., 2021). Therefore, a  multi-objective optimization algorithm that can target different outputs  simultaneously may be preferable (Hesami and Jones, 2020; Yilmaz,  2021). In multi-objective optimization algorithms, input variables are  considered as multi-objective optimization problems, whereas the so 
lutions recognize the best possible balance among various functions  (target variables) (Tanabe and Ishibuchi, 2020; Yilmaz, 2021). Recently  non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was used for  optimizing different in vitro culture systems such as in vitro sterilization  (Hesami et al., 2019a), somatic embryogenesis (Hesami et al., 2020a),  and shoot proliferation (Hesami et al., 2019b). Therefore, the hybridi 
zation of ANNs and multi-objective optimization algorithms can be  considered as an accurate and reliable methodology for studying, pre dicting, and optimizing in vitro seed germination.  
The measurement and assessment of morphological characteristics of  in vitro-grown plantlets is a tedious and time-consuming process in in  vitro studies, making protocol optimization a time consuming and  expensive process (Niazian et al., 2019). New methods that incorporates  machine vision approaches have the potential overcome those diffi 
culties and streamline the process (Dutta Gupta and Pattanayak, 2017;  Genze et al., 2020). Image processing is one of the most well-known  machine vision methods and provides detailed information as well as  greater reliability and accuracy than conventional counting and visual

compared the conventional assessment method with hybrid image  processing and ANN for studying ex vitro seed germination of three  different crops including rye (Secale cereale L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and  pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum [L.] R. Br.). They reported that the  machine learning-based method was robust and helped to speed up seed  germination assessment. In another study, Colmer et al. (2020) sug 
gested a hybrid image processing and ANN as a reliable method for  phenotypic analysis of seed germination of Brassica napus L. varieties.  Hence, image processing provides a robust tool for studying morpho logical features of in vitro-grown seedling.  
The main objective of this study is to optimize the medium compo sition (type and concentration of media and carbohydrate sources) for in  vitro seed germination of hemp. Therefore, the current study was per formed to evaluate the effect of different types and concentrations of  carbohydrate sources (sucrose and glucose) as well as different strengths  of DKW (Driver and Kuniyuki, 1984) and mMS (Murashige and Skoog  Medium, Van der Salm modification (Van der Salm et al., 1994)) on in  vitro seed germination indices as well as morphological features of in  vitro-grown seedlings through the image processing in hemp by using  three well-known ANNs including multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial  basis function (RBF), and generalized regression neural network  (GRNN) in combination with NSGA-II. Also, performance of these  models in modeling and forecasting in vitro hemp seed germination was  compared and provides a foundation to optimize other in vitro methods.  
2. Material and methods  
2.1. Plant material, culture medium, and growth conditions  
Industrial hemp seeds (Cannabis sativa cv. Finola) were used for this  study (CSGA No.1 Certified seed, Lot #: 1908-18637-17-KKF-01). First,  the seeds were washed for 15 min with running tap water. Afterward,  the seeds were dipped for 60 s in 70 % ethanol and then washed with  sterilized deionized water for 5 min under a laminar airflow cabinet.  Once in the laminar flow hood and following the wash, seeds were  sterilized using 12 % (v/v) commercial bleach for 12 min, followed by  three, 5-minute deionized water rinses. Different (one-tenth, half, and  full) strengths of DKW medium (D2470, PhytoTech Labs, Kansas, USA)  supplemented with various levels of sucrose (2 % and 5 %) as well as  different (one-tenth, half, and full) strengths of mMS medium (Phyto tech Labs, Kansas, USA) supplemented with various levels of glucose (2  % and 5 %) were used in this study. All media had 0.6 % agar (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the pH of the media was adjusted to  5.8 using 1 M HCl and NaOH before autoclaving for 20 min at 120 ◦C.  For each treatment, 30 ml of media were poured into a Magenta GA7  vessel (Fisher Scientific, NJ, USA). The in vitro seed germination ex 
periments were performed based on a completely randomized design  (CRD) with a factorial arrangement with 14–16 replicates per treatment,  and each replicate consisted of 4–5 seeds. All culture boxes were placed  in the growth chamber at 25 ± 2 ◦C under 16-h photoperiod with 40 ± 5  μmol m− 2 s− 1 light intensity.  
2.2. Germination indices  
Hemp seeds were considered germinated seed upon emergence of the  radicle and germination was recorded every 10 days for 40 days (4 sets  of counting). Different seed germination indices were used for evalu ating the in vitro germination of hemp seed as follow:  
1) Germination index (GI) was computed based on the following  equation.  
2) Mean germination time (MGT) was calculated based on the following  equation.  
MGT = ∑fd /f (2)  where f is the number of germinated seeds on day d.  
3) Germination rate (GR) was calculated using the following equation:  GR = Gn × 100 (3)  
Where G is the number of germinated seeds by the end of the experiment  and n equals the total number of cultivated seeds.  
4) Timson germination index (TGI) is determined based on the based on  the following equation.  
TGI = ∑GP (4)  
where G is the percentage of germinated seeds per period, and P shows  the germination period.  
5) Vigor index (VI) was determined according to the following  equation.  
VI = G × W (5)  
Where G is the number of germinated seeds at the end of the experiment,  and W represents the weight of seedlings. The weights of the seedlings  were weighed on day 40.  
2.3. Morphological traits  
At the end of the experiment (day 40) morphological traits including  seedling fresh weight, leaf number, shoot length, and root length were  assessed. To measure shoot length and root length, an image processing  was used. The images of the in vitro grown seedlings were captured by  iPhone Xs with the auto-focus feature from a vertical distance of 25 cm.  The reliability of smartphones in capturing images to study plant  morphological traits has been approved by different studies (Friedrichs  et al., 2017; Mohan and Gupta, 2019; Vesali et al., 2017). The acquired  images were processed with ImageJ 1.50i software (National Institute of  Mental Health). The steps of the image processing using ImageJ software  consisted of (i) image acquisition and set scale, (ii) red, green, and blue  (RGB) color cropping filtering, (iii) creation of a grayscale image, (iv)  development of a binary image, (v) remove noises from the binary image  and filling holes, and (vi) measuring the image (shoot or root) length  (Fig. 2a).  
The obtained data were used for modeling, predicting, and opti mizing seed germination indices and morphological traits of cannabis  seedlings. The step-by-step procedure of this experiment has been  summarized in Fig. 2. The Pearson correlation of morphological traits  were estimated using corrplot package (Wei et al., 2017) in R software  version 3.6.1.  
2.4. Modeling procedures

Different strengths of DKW and mMS media and different levels of  sucrose and glucose were selected as input variables, while seed  germination indices (GI, MGT, GR, TGI, and VI) and morphological traits  (seedling fresh weight, shoot length, leaf number, and root length) were  considered as target (output) variables (Fig. 2b).  
To evaluate and compare the efficiency and accuracy of the ANNs, r2  (coefficient of determination), mean bias error (MBE), and root mean  square error (RMSE) were employed.  
2.4.1. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) model  
The 3-layer backpropagation MLP is a distributed and parallel model  that employs supervised learning for the training set that minimizes the  error between the output and input variables through the following  function:  
wji represents the weight of the direct relationship of input neuron i to  the hidden neuron j, wj0 shows the bias for node jth, w0 equals the bias  connected to the neuron of output, and g represents the activation  function for the hidden neuron.  
It is crucial to determine the number of neurons in each node and the  number of hidden units because they play a pivotal role in the perfor mance of MLP. In the current study, the optimal neuron number in the  hidden layer was detected based on trial and error. Also, linear function  (purelin) and hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function (tansig) were applied  as the transfer functions of output layer and hidden layer, respectively.  Moreover, bias and weights were adjusted by using a Levenberg Marquardt algorithm.  
2.4.2. Radial basis function (RBF) model  
Error = 1n∑n n=1 
(ys − ̂ys)2 (6)  
Radial basis function is a three-layer (an input, a hidden, and an  output) ANN model. RBF as a basis of radial basis networks makes a  network of artificial neurons. Euclidean distance between the neural

To compute the ̂y in the MLP with p neurons in the hidden layer and k  output variables, following equation is implemented:  
center and the input in RBF provides activation function input for each  neuron. If the input x as an n-dimensional vector connects to each hid den neuron, each output of the hidden neuron will only relate to the  radial distance between the neural center and the x input vector. Then,

the following function is used for computing the output of each neuron  (hj):  
hj = ∅ (‖ x − cj ‖) j = 1, 2, 3,…, m (8)  
where xi is the ith output variable, wj shows the weighted input data into  the jth hidden neuron, f shows activation function for the output neuron,  
where ‖‖ is Euclidean rule, ϕ shows activation function, cj represents the  jth hidden neuron center, and m equals the number of hidden neurons.

3.1. Effect of media and carbohydrate sources on in vitro seed  germination  
Where ϕj(x) shows the reaction of the jth unit and σ equals the width of  the Gaussian function. Afterward, the minimum mean square is used to  obtain the connection between the weights of hidden and output layers.  Finally, the kth output of the model is determined based on the following  equation:  
̂yk = ∑m 
Wjk ∅j(x) + W0 (10)  j=1 
where ̂yk shows the kth output variable, wjk represents connecting  weight between the kth output variable and the jth hidden neuron, and  w0 shows the bias.  
2.4.3. Generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model  Generalized regression neural network as a standard regression  method is another kind of radial basis network including the input layer,  pattern layer, summation layer, and output layer. The input node  completely enters the pattern node. The distance between stored pattern  outputs is considered as the pattern layer output. The output of each  pattern neuron is connected to S-summation and D-summation neurons  in the summation layer. D-summation neuron computes the unweighted  pattern neuron outputs. S-summation neuron sums the weighted pattern  neuron outputs. Finally, the following equation is used for calculating  the output:  
In the current study, the effect of different concentrations (2% and  5%) of two carbohydrate sources (sucrose and glucose) and different  (one-tenth, half, and full) strengths of DKW and mMS media were  investigated on germination indices and seedling morphological traits of  cannabis. Based on our results (Table 1 and Fig. 3), various morpho 
logical responses were observed in different treatments. The highest root  length (8.68 cm) and leaf number (6.67) were obtained from DKW + 2 %  sucrose and 1/2 DKW + 5 % sucrose, respectively (Table 1). The  maximum seedling fresh weight (0.37 g) and shoot length (13.99 cm)  were observed on the half-strength mMS medium along with 5 %  glucose (Table 1). Generally, seedling fresh weight and shoot length  were decreased on both full-strength media (DKW and mMS) and this  could be a result of the increased osmotic stress arising from higher basal  salt concentrations in those media. Based on the correlation coefficient  results (Fig. 4), all morphological traits were in a significant correlation  with each other. The highest correlation was found between weight and  shoot length and the lowest observed between Root length and Leaf  number with the values of 0.62 and 0.25, respectively.  
According to the results of the current study (Table 1), the maximum  values for all germination indices including GI (1.27), MGT (0.67), GR  (73.50 %), TGI (11.57), and VI (2.19) were observed in half-strength  mMS supplemented with 2 % glucose. Generally, increasing the  strength of both media (from half-strength to full-strength) and the level  of carbohydrate sources resulted in decreasing the seed germination

where ̂y represents the average of all the weighted observed output data,  σ equals width parameter, Di2 shows a scalar function which is based on  any xi and yi observed data, and yi represents the ith output variable.  
2.5. Optimization process  
The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) introduced  by Deb et al. (2002) is a multi-objective evolutionary optimization al gorithm with a strong elitism strategy (Fig. 2c). The pseudocode of  NSGA-II has been described in Fig. 7 (Matnei Filho and Vergilio, 2016).  
NSGA-II was used to find the optimized levels of mMS and sucrose,  mMS and glucose, DKW and sucrose, as well as DKW and glucose to  maximize two most important germination indices including GR and  MGT as fitness functions. The crossover rate, generation number, initial  population, and mutation rate were respectively set to 0.7, 1000, 200,  and 0.5 to obtain the best fitness. To choose the elite population for  crossover, a roulette wheel selection approach was employed.  
MATLAB (Matlab, 2010) software was used for writing ANNs and  optimization algorithms codes.  
2.6. Validation experiment  
To confirm the efficiency and reliability of the developed model, the  best predicted-optimized result was experimentally tested with 15 rep licates, and each replicate containing five seeds.  
comprehensive knowledge on in vitro seed germination of cannabis after  training and testing from the experimental dataset. In the current study,  three ANNs (RBF, MLP, and GRNN) were employed to predict seed  germination indices and seedling morphological traits based on the  various strengths of DKW and mMS media supplemented with different  levels of sucrose and glucose. The GRNN model displayed higher pre 
dictive accuracy (r2 > 0.70) in comparison to RBF or MLP in both  training and testing sets for all germination indices and morphological  traits including GI (r2 > 0.72 for GRNN vs. r2 > 0.61 for MLP or r2 > 0.67  for RBF), MGT (r2 > 0.72 for GRNN vs. r2 > 0.67 for MLP or r2 > 0.62 for  RBF), GR (r2 > 0.71 for GRNN vs. r2 > 0.64 for MLP or r2 > 0.64 for RBF),  TGI (r2 > 0.73 for GRNN vs. r2 > 0.69 for MLP or r2 > 0.70 for RBF), VI  (r2 > 0.70 for GRNN vs. r2 > 0.61 for MLP or r2 > 0.64 for RBF), seedling  fresh weight (r2 > 0.71 for GRNN vs. r2 > 0.64 for MLP or r2 > 0.64 for  RBF), root length (r2 > 0.72 for GRNN vs. r2 > 0.63 for MLP or r2 > 0.66  for RBF), shoot length (r2 > 0.73 for GRNN vs. r2 > 0.64 for MLP or r2 > 0.66 for RBF), and leaf number (r2 > 0.73 for GRNN vs. r2 > 0.63 for MLP  or r2 > 0.64 for RBF) (Table 2). Also, the regression lines revealed a good  fit correlation between experimental and predicted values for all the  germination indices and morphological traits in both training (Fig. 5)  and testing (Fig. 6) sets. In addition, model accuracy was evaluated by  RMSE and MBE, which proved the better performance of GRNN in  comparison with RBF and MLP (Table 2).  
3.3. Optimization via non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and  validation experiment  
NSGA-II as an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm  was subjected to the GRNN (the most accurate model in this study) in  order to find the optimal type and level of media and carbohydrate  sources for obtaining the best seed germination indices (GR and MGT).  According to the optimization process (Table 3), 0.43 strength mMS

4. Discussion  
Successful in vitro cannabis seed germination is not only important  for obtaining juvenile tissue as a potential explant for different in vitro  procedures (e. g. gene transformation, callus culture, secondary  metabolite and biofuel production), but also crucial for screening stress 
tolerant genotypes (Deguchi et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2018; Sorokin et al.,  2021). Therefore, it is necessary to study and optimize factors affecting  in vitro seed germination of cannabis such as medium compositions  including macronutrients, micronutrients, vitamins, plant growth reg 
ulators, amino acids, and carbohydrate sources (Boonsnongcheep and  Pongkitwitoon, 2020; Hesami and Jones, 2020). During in vitro seed  germination, seeds are cultured on artificial media containing essential  nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and carbohydrate required for the  successful germination and growth of the seedlings (Hesami et al., 2018;  Utami and Hariyanto, 2019). Consequentially, the success of in vitro seed  germination is significantly affected by culture media composition (Kim  et al., 2019). The carbohydrate type and concentration during in vitro  seed germination not only influences growth and development, but also  seed germination indices such as germination percentage (Bozdemir  et al., 2018; Roni et al., 2018). Several studies have previously  demonstrated that different species and plant tissues need a specific  carbohydrate source in different stages of plant tissue culture (Hesami  et al., 2019c; Roni et al., 2018; Yaseen et al., 2013). Moreover, the effect  of type and strength of the basal medium as a source of nutrients and  vitamins on in vitro seed germination leads to good outcomes for seed ling growth and development without any physiological disorders  (Hesami et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019; Roni et al., 2018). Therefore, the  type and concentration of different elements in the media (e. g.  
macronutrients, micronutrients, vitamins, carbohydrate) should be  selected and optimized based on species and in vitro culture procedure  (Hesami and Jones, 2020; Lin et al., 2017). The current study demon strated the impact of type and concentration of carbohydrate sources  (sucrose and glucose) on in vitro cannabis seed germination using  different strengths of mMS and DKW media.  
However, optimizing in vitro seed germination as a nonlinear,  multivariable, and complex system is a highly tedious, expensive, and  time-consuming process. (Hesami and Jones, 2020; Lin et al., 2017)  Thus, there is a serious need for the application of new computational  approaches such as machine learning algorithms to analyze and opti 
mize this type of system more efficiently using fewer treatments (Nia zian and Niedbała, 2020; Silva et al., 2019). Recently, the reliability and  accuracy of different types of ANNs such as RBF, MLP, and GRNN have  been studied in different stages of plant tissue culture (Hesami and  Jones, 2020). For instance, Zhang et al. (2020) used MLP for modeling  and predicting organogenic callus production based on four input var iables (agar concentration, humidity, light time, and culture tempera ture), and reported that MLP was able to accurately model and predict  the system (r2 > 0.96). In another study, MLP was employed to model  and predict in vitro root formation in grapevine based on the concen tration of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and Exposure time to IBA (Gago  et al., 2010). They reported that r2 of developed model for modeling  roots number was 78.53. In another study, Hesami et al. (2019b)  employed RBF for modeling and predicting in vitro shoot proliferation in  chrysanthemum based on four input variables including 6-benzylamino purine (BAP), IBA, phloroglucinol, and sucrose. They showed that RBF  was able to accurately model and predict shoot proliferation (r2 > 0.98).  Recently, Salehi et al. (2021) used GRNN for modeling and predicting in  vitro paclitaxel biosynthesis in hazel based on four inputs including  culture filtrate levels, cell extract time, elicitor adding day, and cell  harvesting time, and reported that r2 of developed GRNN for modeling  paclitaxel biosynthesis was over 0.88. However, uncertainties regarding  machine learning outcomes represents one of the main problems with

machine learning algorithms (Yang et al., 2020). There are three main  sources of uncertainty in machine learning studies including data  quality, the sample of data collected from the domain, and model fit  (Saltzman and Yung, 2018). To avoid uncertainties, several studies have  suggested using different machine learning algorithms and validating  the predicted results in the lab (Englert et al., 2019; Saltzman and Yung,  2018; Yang et al., 2020). Therefore, in the current study, different ANNs  were used and the results of the most accurate model were tested in a  validation experiment.  
According to our results, GRNN had better performance than RBF  and MLP for modeling and predicting germination indices and  morphological traits of cannabis. Although there are no studies in the  plant tissue culture area to compare these models, several studies in  other fields of agriculture reported that GRNN had better accuracy than  other ANNs such as MLP and RBF. In line with our results, Jafari and  Shahsavar (2020) compared the efficiency of different ANNs for  modeling and forecasting morphological responses of lime under water  deficiency and reported that GRNN had the highest degree of accuracy  in comparison with MLP and RBF. Also, Hosseini-Moghari and Araghi nejad (2015) demonstrated that GRNN had better performance than  MLP and RBF in predicting drought indices and drought classes.  
Moreover, we linked the GRNN models to NSGA-II in order to opti mize morphological traits and germination indices. The efficiency of  
genetic algorithms, both GA and NSGA-II, have been previously  confirmed in different plant tissue culture processes (Hesami and Jones,  2020). In the current study, GR and MGT as the two most important  germination indices were selected as target variables for optimizing  medium composition through the hybrid GRNN-NSGA-II. The results of  the optimization process accurately predicted that 0.43 strength mMS  medium along with 2.3 % sucrose would result in the maximum seed  germination outcomes. This result showed that the moderate level of  sucrose (2.3 %) in 0.43 strength mMS medium improved the seed  germination percentage compared with the higher levels of sucrose in  more or lower strength mMS medium. Similar results have been found in  other species, where moderate levels of sucrose and basal salts were  found to be ideal (Huh et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2011; Roni et al.,  2018). For instance, Roni et al. (2018) reported that a moderate level of  sucrose (3 %) and half-strength MS medium resulted in the maximum  seed germination percentage in Eustoma grandiflorum. In line with our  result, Hu et al. (2018) previously showed that ex vitro seed germination  of hemp is inhibited by high concentrations of salts. Generally, it seems  that seed germination in hemp in both ex vitro and in vitro conditions is  sensitive to a high level of salts, yet moderate levels are useful to provide  the necessary nutrients. Therefore, a moderate level of salts existing in  culture media (0.43 strength of the medium) can improve in vitro seed  germination of hemp.

The results of the validation experiment showed that there was no  considerable difference between predicted optimized results and  experimental results for seed germination in C. sativa cv. ‘Finola’,  demonstrating the accuracy of this algorithm. In contrast with in vitro  seed germination in cannabis, in vitro propagation and regeneration  methods have been well studied and the challenges surrounding recal 
citrance of the species and replicability of many methods has been  reviewed extensively (Monthony et al., 2021). Recently, Page et al.  (2021) assessed the effect of various concentrations of different plant  growth regulators as well as basal media types for shoot growth and  explant multiplication in cannabis. Their study highlighted the necessity  
of media optimization for maximizing shoot proliferation and mini mizing physiological defects. Therefore, the developed models in the  current study can be employed for predicting and optimizing other in  vitro culture procedures in cannabis.  
5. Conclusion  
In vitro seed germination is a complex biological process affecting by  various factors such as type and concentration of macronutrients,  micronutrients, vitamins, gelling agent, carbohydrate, temperature, and  light. Data modeling by ANNs can display a reliable solution to provide

comprehensive knowledge on in vitro seed germination. According to the  results of the current study, GRNN has better accuracy than other  studied ANNs. Also, the hybrid GRNN and NSGA-II as a multi-objective  optimization algorithm could precisely predict and optimize in vitro seed  germination of industrial hemp cultivar ‘Finola’ and future studies  should assess the suitability of this model and the optimized media in  
germination of other commercial drug-type and fiber-type C. sativa. The  results of the current study show that the high seed germination rate of  hemp can be achieved from the moderate level (0.43 strength) of mMS  medium supplemented with a moderate level of sucrose (2.3 %).

the high cost of drug type cannabis. Furthermore, future studies can use  this treatment as a basal medium for studying other factors affecting in  vitro seed germination. While the current model was developed for  predicting and optimizing in vitro seed germination media, we also  suggest that its adaptation in other in vitro culture procedures could  present a forward-thinking aid to predicting and optimizing media  compositions for the micropropagation and regeneration of mature  stage 2 in vitro explants and consequentially overcome many of the  challenges faced currently in cannabis micropropagation. Therefore,  GRNN-NSGA-II can be employed in future tissue culture studies to  optimize different factors involved in in vitro culture of cannabis and  other species.
