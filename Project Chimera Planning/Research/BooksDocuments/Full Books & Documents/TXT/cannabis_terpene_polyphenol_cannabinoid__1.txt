1. Introduction  
ABSTRACT  
In recent years, hemps health and nutritional properties recognition has led to an impressive growth of Cannabis  research, industrial processing, and the related market. Moreover, the demand for natural Cannabis-derived  compounds (i.e. terpenes, polyphenols, and cannabinoids) is constantly growing. In spite of the strict regulation  of some countries, the global market needs suitable technologies for the smart recovery of bioactive Cannabis  metabolites. Conventional extraction procedures can show drawbacks, in terms of environmental impact and  their high energy consumption. Microwaves (MW), a mature technique for extraction-process intensification, is  attracting great amounts of attention in academic-research and industrial-application fields for its technological  advantages. This work aims to design a fast and cost-efficient MW-assisted cascade protocol for bioactive  Cannabis compounds recovery in a pilot-scale reactor. Microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD) can provide  a volatile hydrodistillate that is rich in monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and a small amount of phytocannabinoids.  Using non-canonical protocol of hydrodistillation, the definition of “volatile fraction” is generally considered  more appropriate than “essential oil”.  
The health-promoting activity of this combination has been proposed in literature, and can constitute matter  of further investigations. The optimized MAHD procedure yielded 0.35 ± 0.02 % w/w of hydrodistillate, while  conventional hydrodistillation gave only 0.12 ± 0.01 %, w/w (in relation to dry inflorescence mass). The water  resulting in the vessel after MAHD showed a high total polyphenolic content (5.35 ± 0.23 %, w/w). Two flavones  known for their beneficial effects to health, namely luteolin-7-O-glucoside and apigenin-7-O-glucoside, were  detected and quantified. An attempt to recover phytocannabinoid using the MW-assisted hydrodiffusion and  gravity method (MAHG) was also carried out. Cannabinoids (CBD and THC) content was determined in fresh  Cannabis and in production streams. During MAHD, phytocannabinoid decarboxylation inside the residual matrix  was around 70 % (69.01 ± 0.98 % and 74.32 ± 1.02 % for THC and CBD respectively). Furthermore, the overall  content of these metabolites was not affected by the hydrodistillation, preserving the processed plant material for  subsequent ethanolic extraction.  
in various fields, including in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, paper,  
textile, and construction industries, as food and animal-feed additives,  
Cannabis sativa L. (Cannabaceae family), known as hemp, is a  widespread plant species cultivated for a wide range of industrial  products (Fathordoobady et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2017; Fiorini et al.,  2019). These products are fibres, seed oils, and biomasses that are used  
phytoremediation agents, biofuel, varnishes, and inks (Fiorini et al.,  2019). Hemp has a highly complex chemical composition that includes  carbohydrates, terpenoids, alkaloids, stilbenoids, quinones, flavonoids,  fatty acids, phenols, and cannabinoids (Brighenti et al., 2017;

Brenneisen, 2007; Drini´c et al., 2020). The latter are particular Cannabis  plant metabolites (Brighenti et al., 2017; Lewis-Bakker et al., 2019). The  term phytocannabinoids was proposed for specific Cannabis plant  products due to the occurrence of synthetic cannabinoids and endo 
cannabinoids (Brenneisen, 2007). One of the most interesting phyto cannabinoids in hemp is the non-psychoactive cannabidiol (CBD) (De  Vita et al., 2019) whose global market increased to a value of USD 1.90  billion in 2018, and it is estimated that it will grow by a further 49 % by  2024 (BDS Analytics, 2019). Besides CBD, other notable phytocanna binoids that possess no or low psychotropic activity are cannabigerol,  cannabichromene, cannabinol, cannabicyclol, cannabinodiol, and there  is the psychoactive Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (Fathordoobady  et al., 2019; McAllister et al., 2015).  
In recent years, the popularity of medical Cannabis extracts has  grown rapidly due to extensive reviews of the pharmacological activity  of this plant material (Lewis-Bakker et al., 2019), which is mainly  attributed to the presence of phytocannabinoids. They act as antiepi 
leptic, anticonvulsive, anti-neurodegenerative, antiemetic, and anal gesic agents, and possess antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties  as well (Fathordoobady et al., 2019). Most of these metabolites are  present in fresh hemp and carry a carboxylic acid moiety (De Vita et al.,  2019; Lewis-Bakker et al., 2019). Acid cannabinoids show low potency  for cannabimimetic activity receptor (CAR) binding. However, their  decarboxylated homologues forms, usually called neutral cannabinoids,  display high affinities for CAR and psychological activities. The decar boxylation step is therefore crucial for the strengthening of Cannabis  pharmacological activity (Lewis-Bakker et al., 2019), and easily occurs  when the acid metabolites are exposed to heat and light, due to their  
instability (Brighenti et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016).  The characteristic Cannabis fragrance is attributed to approximately  140 different terpenoids (Brenneisen, 2007). In particular, the volatile  and semi-volatile fractions in hemp are composed of monoterpenes and  sequiterpenes, and some heavier waxes and resins. Additionally,  oxygenated terpenoids can also be found (Leghissa et al., 2018). In  forthcoming years, terpenoids have received great attention because of  their sensorial properties, with peculiar chemical fingerprinting for  various Cannabis cultivars, and investigations concerning their syner gism with phytocannabinoids (Giese et al., 2015). Many studies have  proposed the application of extracts, so-called phytocomplexes, con taining a mixture of phytocannabinoids and terpenoids, rather than pure  synthetic molecules, thus suggesting the existence of complementary or  synergistic interactions, often called entourage effects (De Vita et al.,  2019; Elzinga et al., 2015). Relative evidences are still to be clarified. In  addition, particular terpenoids’ pharmacological and medical properties  as such have been reported (Fiorini et al., 2019; Leghissa et al., 2018).  The recovery of biologically active compounds, such as phyto cannabinoids and terpenes, from hemp is a crucial step for their further  applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries (Fathordoobady  et al., 2019), and it is typically performed under conventional  solid-liquid extractions, such as maceration and percolation. Soxhlet and  hydro/steam distillation, entail high energy consumption, long extrac tion times and can only provide the partial recovery of the desired  compounds (Chemat et al., 2012). Over the last decade, attention has  shifted to the development of innovative enabling extraction techniques,  such as microwave-assisted (MAE), ultrasound (US), pressurized-liquid,  supercritical-fluid extraction and instant controlled pressure-drop, with  the aim of overcoming these shortcomings (Fathordoobady et al., 2019;  Chemat et al., 2019). The use of microwave (MW) technology in  bioactive-compound extraction offers a number of advantages: rapid  heating, shorter process time, reduction in solvent usage, higher  reproducibility, higher extraction rates, and increases in yield (Fathor doobady et al., 2019; Lewis-Bakker et al., 2019; Veggi et al., 2013).  Extraction rates and yields, in particular, can be increased by the  enhancement of heat and mass-transfer phenomena, working in synergy  (Veggi et al., 2013).  
Terpenoid yields usually vary from 0.01 to 1.5 % of the inflorescence  
dry weight (Giese et al., 2015). The hemp volatile fraction, as  mentioned, consists of monoterpenes, such as α-pinene, myrcene and  terpinolene, and bitter-tasting sesquiterpenes, such as E-caryophyllene,  α-humulene, and caryophyllene oxide (Fiorini et al., 2019). These  compounds can be recovered via hydro- or steam distillation using  Clevenger apparatus, which is the conventional extraction technique, or  by means of supercritical CO2 (scCO2) (Brenneisen, 2007; Markle,  2019). As abovementioned, steam and hydro-distillation have numerous  drawbacks and, moreover, their harsh conditions can affect  essential-oils quality (Markle, 2019; Lucchesi et al., 2004; Iriti et al.,  2006; Ferhat et al., 2007). Supercritical CO2 extraction protocols are  well suited for phytocannibinoids recovery, and improved selectivity  can be achieved by varying working pressure by co-solvent additions  (Marzorati et al., 2020; Moreno et al. (2020). Nevertheless, the main  disadvantage of scCO2 extraction is the fact that processing fresh plant  materials is impossible due to the formation of carbonic acid from CO2  and water (Markle, 2019). The required desiccation of the matrix  dramatically affects the whole volatile-composition fingerprint (Fiorini  et al., 2019).  
Microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD), can be an efficient  alternative for Cannabis terpenes recovery. This process is much more  efficient than traditional hydro- and steam distillation as the irradiation  heats the plant material evenly (Markle, 2019; Ciriminna et al., 2017).  Many recently published studies have indicated that MW can even  enhance oil extraction, by reducing process time and boosting produc 
tivity, when compared with conventional extraction methods  (Rezvankhah et al., 2019). Abovementioned advantages of this tech nique opened the way to its application in the extraction of phyto cannabinoids, to date comprehensively reviewed (Brighenti et al., 2017;  Lewis-Bakker et al., 2019; Drini´c et al., 2020). Microwave-assisted  extraction enables phytocannabinoids decarboxylation unlike several  other extraction methodologies, where the occurrence of this phenom enon is quite negligible (Brighenti et al., 2017; Lewis-Bakker et al.,  2019). This feature is of great importance as it leads to high quality  products with measurable pharmacological activity in patients (Lew is-Bakker et al., 2019). In addition to cannabinoids and terpenoids ap plications, several publications have described hemp polyphenols MAE  (Drini´c et al., 2020; Mateˇsi´c et al., 2020; Teh et al., 2014).  
2. Material and methods  
2.1. Materials  
Ethanol (ACS grade, ≥99 %), used for cannabinoid extraction, and  methanol (ACS grade, ≥99 %), used for polyphenol enrichment and  HPLC analysis, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,  USA). Milli-Q H2O was obtained in the laboratory using a Milli-Q  Reference A + System (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, DE, USA). The  standards (Cannabis Terpenes Mix A, Cannabis Terpenes Mix B, can 
nabidiol, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, gallic acid, apigenin-7-O-glucoside,  luteolin-7-O-glucoside, catechin, epicatecthin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic  acid, quercetin-3-O-glucoside), the Folin–Ciocalteau reagent and sodium  carbonate, for total phenolic assays, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich  (St. Louis, MO, USA).  
2.2. Plant material and its inflorescence content  
The plant material studied was Cannabis sativa L. cv. Monoica, and  was kindly provided by the company Egeria s.r.l. (Milano, Italy). The  matrix was collected in the middle of September 2019 at the fields of  Azienda Agricola Prina Pietro (Pavia, Italy, N 45◦13′10.3′′, E 9◦11′22.1′′,  2.7 ha) and was in a 8.7 phenological growth stage (60 % ripe fruit).  After collection, the fresh plant material was vacuum packed and stored  at − 18 ◦C. In all experiments, the plant material was used without  defrosting.  
The collected Cannabis contained inflorescences, leaves, and stalks.

V. Gunjevi´c et al. 
One kg of Cannabis was thoroughly selected and weighed in order to  obtain the ratio between the inflorescence and the other components of  the matrix.  
2.3. Water-content determination in plant material  
The water content in frozen Cannabis was determined using the  gravimetric method. Plant material was sampled in triplicate from 1 kg  frozen bag and dried in a furnace muffler (Gelman Instrument Company,  USA) at 100 ◦C for 24 h.  
2.4. Volatile extraction  
2.4.1. Microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD)  
The terpene fraction from the Cannabis was recovered using MAHD.  It was performed in an ETHOS X (Milestone s.r.l., Italy), a multimode  MW reactor, at a maximum delivered power of 1800 W (Fig. 1A). All  extractions were performed in a 12 L vessel The temperature was  monitored using an infrared sensor. The MW power during the extrac 
tions was set as follows: 500 W for 3 min, 1100 W for 3 min, 1600 W for  14 min, and finally 1500 W for 90 min. The overall time, necessary to  complete volatile compound extraction, was then 1 h and 50 min.  
Twelve tests were performed under different conditions. 2.5–2.8 kg  of matrix were extracted in all tests. The plant material was always  placed evenly in the extraction vessel directly from the freezer.  
Even though the Cannabis was fresh and still hydrated, supplemen tary water was placed in the extraction vessel together with the material  prior to extraction. The extractions were performed with matrix-to liquid ratios of 1/0.5–1/1.5 (kg/L). Moreover, the use of tap water,  deionized water, and a NaCl solution (20 %) was tested.  
Once the vessel was filled with plant material and water, it was  placed into the MW cavity of the reactor. The distillation head was  assembled with a florentine vase and the extraction process was started.  As the terpenes are distilled together with a large amount of liquid, the  water was able to recirculate from the florentine vase back into the  vessel.  
Table 1 reports the mass of extracted Cannabis, the plant-material-to water-ratio and water feed used in every test, as well as the equipment  and method alterations made to the processes. As reported in Table 1,  additional alterations were made for some tests. In Tests 7, 8, and 9, the  plant material was placed in a cotton bag (CB) during extraction. A  polyether ether ketone (PEEK) net was placed above the matrix in Test 6.  Both the CB and net were used to homogenize the re-circulated water  distribution and to enhance overall wetness during extraction, thus  helping to prevent the browning effect and potential degradation. In  Test 4, the plant material was moved every 30 min, temporary removing  
the vessel from the chamber. Hot water (50 ◦C) was added at the  beginning of Test 3 to fasten the onset of terpene distillation. In Test 12,  a fractionating Vigreux column (20 cm length) was assembled to connect  the MW cavity and the distillation head, instead of the regular straight  column, in order to investigate the variation in the volatiles fingerprint.  Finally, in Test 13, the sampling of the recovered terpenes was per 
formed every 15 min to follow changes in terpene profile with extraction  time.  
Once the run was completed, the terpenes fraction was recovered  from the florentine vase of the MW system. The extracted terpenes are  not miscible with water and hence can be found as the lighter oily phase  above the water column. Every run was performed in triplicate and the  mass of the obtained volatile fraction was noted for every extraction and  expressed as average ± S.D. Yield of the volatile fraction was calculated  both in relation to dry matrix and on dry inflorescences. The volatile  fraction was then analyzed using GC-MS. The CBD and THC quantitative  analysis of the extract that was obtained in the optimal MAHD test was  performed using UPLC-MS/MS.  
2.4.2. Conventional hydrodistillation (CHD)  
Conventional hydrodistillation was performed in order to compare  the efficiency of MAHD terpene extraction to a conventionally applied  procedure. It was carried out according to the essential oils extraction  methods described in European Pharmacopoeia 8th Edition (2013) with  few modifications due to the equipment limitations. The Cannabis was  placed in a 2 L round bottom flask and deionized water was added at a  solid/liquid ratio of 1–5. The round bottom flask was placed inside a  heating mantle, whilst a Clevenger-type apparatus and a refrigerant  were assembled. The extraction time was 4 h. The yield of the recovered  hydrodistillate was expressed on dry matrix and only dry inflorescence  mass. The hydrodistillate yield and composition was compared with the  ones obtained in MAHD tests. The extraction was performed in tripli cate, expressing the results as average ± S.D.  
2.5. Hydrodistillate analysis  
The GC-MS qualitative analyses of the volatile fractions obtained in  MAHD and CHD were performed in an Agilent Technologies 6850  Network GC System fitted with a 5973 Network Mass Selective Detector,  7683B Automatic Sampler, and a capillary column Mega 5MS (length 30  m; i.d. 0.25 mm; film thickness 0.25 μm, Mega S.r.l., Italy) according to  the method reported by Gunjevi´c et al. (2020). The identification of the  individual compounds was performed with two approaches: 1) by  comparing the retention time and mass spectrum with standard com 
pounds, 2) by using GC-MS Wiley275 and NIST05 GC libraries from the  acquired chromatograms, considering only matching level over 95 %.  The summed areas of the relevant peaks were normalized to 100 %.  Relative peak areas, calculated as percentages, were used to evaluate  extract composition.  
2.6. Water after MAHD  
Due to the addition of an abundant amount of water to the plant  material before MAHD, there is a significant volume of liquid remaining  in the extraction vessel after the process. The aqueous fraction was  filtered, freeze dried (LyoQuest – 85 lyophilizer, Azbil Telstar Technol 
ogies, Spain), and analysed in terms of dry extract yield and  polyphenols.  
2.6.1. Total phenolic content (TPC) determination  
TPC in the water fraction after MAHD was determined according to  the method described in Hillis and Swain (1959). 250 μL of the extract  solution (1 mg/mL in 50 % EtOH) was placed into the test tube and  diluted with 4 mL of deionized water. A sodium carbonate solution (10  %, w/v) and the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (diluted 1:1 with deionized  
Fig. 1. Cannabis sativa L. storage under vacuum. water) were added sequentially. The resulting solution was mixed

thoroughly. After 25 min, the absorption of the blue complex was  measured at 725 nm, in a 1 cm quartz cuvette, using a Cary 60 UV–vis  spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, USA), against a blank. Gallic  acid was used as the standard. TPC was expressed as gallic acid equiv 
alents (GAE, mg/g) over the dried extract and gallic acid equivalents  (GAE, mg/g) over the dried matrix. All analyses were performed in  triplicate.  
2.6.2. Polyphenol enrichment  
Polyphenols from the water fraction after the optimal MAHD pro tocol were enriched using solid phase extraction (SPE) on a C18 Sep-Pak  cartridge (Waters, USA) for analytical purposes, following the procedure  described by Gunjevi´c et al. (2020). Purified polyphenolic rich fraction  was analysed using HPLC-DAD.  
2.6.3. Polyphenol analysis  
Identification and quantification of polyphenols present in the above  described fraction (paragraph 2.6.2.) were performed using a HPLC  system (Waters Corp., USA) coupled with a diode array detector (UV/  DAD, Waters Corp., USA) and an automatic sampler (Waters Corp.,  USA). In particular, luetolin-7-O-glucoside, apigenin-7-O-glucoside,  catechin, epicatecthin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and quercetin-3-O 
glucoside separation was achieved on a Synergi Hydro RP C18 column  (250 mm, 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Phenomenex, USA) by gradient elution and UV DAD acquisitions as described by Gunjevi´c et al. (2020). Chromatograms  were acquired at 340 nm, performing three injections for each sample.  
2.7. Phytocannabinoid extraction  
Phytocannabinoids were extracted both from the fresh matrix and  from the depleted biomass in the optimal MAHD process. Cannabinoid  extraction from fresh plant material was performed for two purposes.  The first objective was the fresh plant determination of CBD and THC  content. The second target was to provide a control parameter for  cannabinoid decarboxylation after MAHD. Together with the  
conventional benchmark, a MW-assisted protocol was tested on the fresh  plant to investigate the technique’s phytocannabinoid-recovery effi ciency. The Cannabis inflorescence was separated from the rest of the  plant in every extraction.  
2.7.1. Conventional extraction under reflux  
For analytical purposes, conventional reflux cannabinoid extractions  were performed using ethanol (99 %) as the solvent. The extraction time  was 2.5 h and the solid-to-liquid ratio was 1–10. The obtained extract  was filtered and the ethanol was evaporated. Moreover, two extractions  were performed for every sample to evaluate the decarboxylation effi 
ciency of the MAHD extraction method. In one of these extractions, the  Cannabis inflorescence was placed in a furnace muffler for 30 min at 120 ◦C before extraction to promote cannabinoid decarboxylation, while this  step was skipped in the other extraction. For every obtained extract, the  yield was noted and the CBD, CBDA, THC, and THCA contents were  evaluated. Every set of extractions was performed in triplicate and the  contents of CBD, THC and their acid analogues were expressed as  average ± S.D.  
2.7.2. Microwave-assisted hydrodiffusion and gravity (MAHG)  Microwave-assisted hydrodiffusion and gravity was also performed  in the ETHOS X MW reactor, but using a different system configuration  in which the extract was recovered in the flask placed under the reactor  (see Fig. 1B). The frozen Cannabis (200 g) was placed evenly in the 5 L  extraction vessel, which was housed in the MW cavity of the reactor. The  condensation system and the collection flask were assembled from the  bottom of the device. Thanks to the opening on the top of the MW cavity,  steam was introduced into the system. The extraction method provided a  continuous irradiation of 200 W for 60 min. Steam was fed into the  vessel for 30 s every 5 min. The temperature was monitored with an  infrared sensor and never exceeded 100 ◦C.  
During the extraction, the extract was continuously collected in the  receiving flask. Once the process was completed, the collected extract  was freeze-dried and analyzed for its extraction yield, and CBD and THC

content. This extraction was performed 3 times, and the extraction yield,  CBD and THC contents were expressed as average ± S.D.  
2.8. Phytocannabinoid analysis  
Quantitative determination of phytocannabinoids CBD and THC was  carried out on a Waters Acquity TQD UPLC-MS/MS system, Using a  Waters BEH C18 (2.1 × 50, 1.7μ) column. Adopted method and relative  calibrations are reported by Gunjevi´c et al. (2020). Each sample was  divided in two specimens: the first was directly analysed whilst the  second was firstly decarboxylated in oven. THCA and CBDA were  quantified as difference between cannabinoids detected in the two  specimens.  
2.9. Statistical analysis  
Statistical data analysis was performed using software Statistica  (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA), v.10. The measurements were processed  using Tukey’s HSD test and statistical differences (p-value < 0.05) were  indicated by lower-case letters on the Figures.  
3. Results and discussion  
3.1. Inflorescence and water content in plant material  
The collected Cannabis sativa L. cv. Monoica consisted of 73.70 % ± 3.22 % w/w of inflorescence and 36.30 % ± 2.98 % w/w of stalks and  leaves.  
The average water content in Cannabis, determined by thermogra vimetric analysis, amounted in 69.97 ± 2.63 %, w/w. In particular,  71.15 ± 0.98 % was in the inflorescences, while 59.72 ± 0.89 %, w/w in  
separated stalks and leaves.  
3.2. Volatiles extraction  
3.2.1. Microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD)  
By considering the growing demand for Cannabis-derived terpenes  from today’s hemp market, the aim of this work is to present a novel  pilot-scale extraction procedure for their recovery. Extractions were  performed in a multimodal MW reactor and several tests with different  extraction conditions were investigated (see Table 1).  
The terpene-fraction mass was monitored for each test (GC-MS per centage peak area). Moreover, CBD relative area % was registered, as a  control parameter to describe pyhtocannabinoids extraction behaviour.  CBD was conveniently chosen being the most abundant in the matrix.  The hydrodistillate mass and yield, the time of distillation onset, and  CBD are reported for every MAHD test in Table 1.  
First, the quantity of water added to the system to enhance the  stripping power of steam was screened, and its influence on the process  was determined. Water addition can increase terpene yield but, more  importantly, it prevents partial material burning (consequently, me 
tabolites degradation), thus preserving quality and use of the matrix  after MAHD, such as selective phytocannabinoids recovery (Markle,  2019). Moreover, material combustion during distillation can lead to the  release of undesired compounds into the volatile fraction. All sources of  water (added and contained in the plant) were heated during the  extraction, generating steam that allows the release of terpenes from  Cannabis inflorescence and carries them to the distillation head. As re 
ported in Fig. 2A, the intermediate plant/liquid ratio of 1:1 proved to be  the most efficient, as it kept the matrix wet until the end of the extraction  and led to the highest yield. For this reason, the remaining  MAHD-screening tests were carried out using this water amount. Fiorini

et al. (2020) performed MAHD in a similar reactor set-up, and likewise  studied the water addition effect. These authors reported the highest  volatiles yield when 30 % of water was added. Further addition of water  decreased the yield. This consideration differ much from results re 
ported in Fig. 2A, according to which, when expressing the water  addition in percentage, the highest volatile fraction’s yield was achieved  when water content was 50 %, while yields decrease was noted for both  25 % and 75 % water contents.  
Moreover, the effect of having a deionized water (Test 1) or feed with  different quantities of solutes, namely tap water and a 20 % NaClaq so lution (Test 2 and Test 5), was studied. The greatest yield was observed  in Test 2, followed by Test 1 and Test 5, as shown by comparison re ported in Fig. 2B. Yields from Test 1 and Test 2 were not statistically  different. However, since tap water does not require additional treat ments as the deionization, it was selected. A high amount of salts is  usually exploited to enhance MW absorption, hence leading to higher  temperatures and a faster heating ramp. In fact, the onset of distillation  was reduced by 2 min for Test 5. However, the rapid temperature in crease led to the lowest extraction yield observed, instead of increasing  hydrodistillate recovery. Compound degradation, likely due to the  increased boiling point of the system and difficult temperature control,  is assumed to be the reason (Mcgraw et al., 1999; Namdar et al., 2018).  Nevertheless, this peculiar episode requires further study.  
The use of hot water (50 ◦C) as the liquid feed was considered as a  mean to accelerate the distillation onset, while investigating how this  approach could affect the extraction of volatiles. This approach could  allow to speed up the distillation onset, reducing the MW irradiation  time on the plant material. Thus, the matrix can be preserved from  degradation phenomena. As expected, MAHD onset was accelerated  from 16 to 12 min, saving a quarter of the total heating step (see Table 1,  Test 2 vs. Test 3). As depicted in Fig. 2C, both the volatile fraction and  inflorescence yield were slightly affected by the hot-water protocol,  however not statistically significant. It can be assumed that the products  leaked during addition and plant preparation because of the high vola tility of the terpenic compounds. Since no statistical difference was  noted, remaining tests were performed with room- temperature (RT)  water addition.  
To prevent any loss during matrix moisturizing and positioning, the  same screening was studied using a CB, and both RT and a 50 ◦C water  feed were evaluated. At the same time, the use of a CB had the role of  protecting the hemp from overheating, maintaining high wetness, and  avoiding burning phenomena. Generally, as reported in Fig. 2C, the use  of a CB significantly reduced the average yield of the process showing  that the cotton fibres had a quenching effect. Furthermore, the onset of  MAHD was significantly delayed, from 16 to 19 min. A similar approach  was tested with a PEEK net (Test 6), aiming to evenly distribute the  recycled water on the matrix, during the distillation process. Though,  also this system led to a decrease in the volatile fraction and inflores cence yield. Test 4 was performed with the matrix being moved every 30  min during extraction. The initial hypothesis was that this should in 
crease the volatile fraction yield, compensating eventual temperature  inhomogeneity, hence releasing terpenes contained in every spot of the  matrix. On the other hand, the extraction yield was much lower. The  explanation of this obtained result can be related to the necessary  equipment extraction and dissembling, in order to carry out the manual  matrix movement, that lead to a volatile-compound loss.  
Close attention was paid on the state of the vegetal matrix after the  extraction treatment, to evaluate any biomass overheating or burning  effect. This never happened, even when the plant material was placed in  
cannabinoid extraction procedure. Hence, every sample was extracted  according to this approach in duplicate, either with a prior heating step  of the sample at 120 ◦C, or directly. The heating protocol was applied to  promote acidic cannabinoid decarboxylation. Both fresh Cannabis  inflorescence and the spent matrix after MAHD were used. The bench 
mark phytocannabinoid extraction of fresh plant material enabled CBD  quantification by means of UPLC-MS/MS analyses. Similarly, THC was  monitored and quantified on the base of national regulation on psy chotropic substances. According to the most recent regulation in the  Italian legislation (note published by the Ministry of the Interior 20/07/  2018 number of protocol 2018/43586), commercial uses of resins,  concentrates and essences (or inflorescences and plants) with THC  concentrations >0.5 %, are considered illegal substances. Hence,  detention and commercialization are illegal (DPR 309/90). Given the  abovementioned regulations, it is mandatory to have a suitable analyt 
ical method for THC determination to verify the conformity. UPLC-MS/  MS results are summarized in Table 2.  
The final analysis of the matrix after MAHD confirmed that MW  irradiation gave phytocannabinoid decarboxylation of about 70 % of the  total (69.01 ± 0.98 % and 74.32 ± 1.02 % for THC and CBD, respec tively). As already mentioned, MW enables extensive phytocannabi noids decarboxylation, providing more active forms of cannabinoids  (Lewis-Bakker et al., 2019), hence it can be considered for further  investigations.  
Percent area of CBD in the volatile fractions was carefully monitored  using GC-MS, as a control parameter for phytocannabinoids state in the  hydrodistillate, due to their biological activity. Fig. 3 compares the CBD  trend to hydrodistillate yields, as calculated on only dry inflorescence.  MAHD provides efficient hydrodistillate recovery and good phyto 
cannabinoid decarboxylation before residual matrix extraction with  ethanol. Nevertheless, it does not deplete the matrix of phytocannabi noids. Hence, the optimized protocol should maximize terpenoids yield  and preserve CBD for the next step.  
The screening of different plant/water ratios allowed achieving the  lowest CBD relative area at a 1/1 ratio (Test 1), while, unlike what  Fiorini et al. (2020) observed, this significantly increased with liquid  content increase (Test 10, Fig. 4A). Moreover, the liquid content  reduction to 1/0.5 ratio led to a limited but statistically significant in 
crease in CBD area, when compared to the 1/1 ratio.  
An even more pronounced increase in this cannabinoid was detected  using 20 % NaClaq MAHD (Test 5), which yielded in the highest CBD  percent area, with 10.51 % vs. 2.49 % and 1.75 % using deionized and  tap water, respectively (Fig. 4B). This trend can be explained by the  increase in the water boiling point, thus permitting the distillation of  compounds with lower volatility.  
Changing the water-feed temperature did not noticeably alter the  CBD area in GC-MS chromatogram of the hydrodistillate, although there  was a slight decrease at 50 ◦C (Test 1 and Test 3, Fig. 4C). On the other  hand, the cannabinoid area was dramatically lower, namely 0.3, 0.55,

chromatogram was 2.21 %, which is analogous with the result obtained  in Test 1, where a regular straight column was used.  
The analytical data indicate that Test 2 gave the best results,  allowing to the highest volatiles yield when performed with tap water,  which is preferable on pilot and industrial scales. The yield of volatiles  fraction expressed on the whole dry matrix was 0.24 ± 0.02 % (w/w),  which corresponded to 0.35 ± 0.02 % (w/w) calculated in relation to  only dry inflorescence. The effective cannabinoid content of the  hydrodistillate, finally, was evaluated by means of UPLC-MS/MS. Re 
sults are reported in Table 2, and define a negligible depletion of the  plant material from these metabolites, resulting in nearly unaffected  inflorescence.  
3.2.2. Conventional hydrodistillation (CHD)  
Conventional hydrodistillation was performed in order to compare  the volatile fraction yield, and its terpene profile, with the one derived  from a non-conventional extraction procedure, MAHD. The recovered  hydrodistillate yield obtained in this process was 0.12 ± 0.01 %, w/w, as  
and 0.62 % for Tests 7, 8, and 9, when the hemp was placed in a CB. The  other physical barrier used, a PEEK net placed above the matrix (Test 6),  gave higher CBD area on the hydrodistillate GC-MS chromatogram,  more precisely 3.20 %. Plant material movement during the extraction  (Test 4) did not affect the CBD percent area (Test 1). In Test 12, a  fractionating Vigreux column was assembled to connect the extraction  vessel with the distillation head. The Vigreux column permits volatile  compounds to be separated by allowing the vapours to cool, condense,  and vaporize again. Every condensation-vaporization cycle enriches  vapours in a certain component, and the larger surface area of the  Vigreux column allows more cycles to be performed (Zuiderweg and  Harmens, 1958). Therefore, this set-up has the objective of distilling the  low boiling point terpenes and separating them from the high boiling  point cannabinoids. However, CBD area in the obtained volatile fraction  
calculated in relation to the only dry inflorescence, and 0.08 ± 0.01 %,  w/w, when calculated on the whole dry matrix. Production was hence  about 3 times lower than the one obtained in the optimized MAHD, by  applying an extraction time of 4 h, therefore significantly longer.  Moreover, CHD was performed using conventional conductive heating,  which is inefficient and has high energy consumption due to thermal  dispersion and material calorimetric restrictions. The slow conductive  heating means that the onset of terpene extraction was heavily delayed  compared with MAHD. These results confirm that process intensification  occurred when MW was applied.  
As showed by GC-MS analyses, the CBD percent area in the resulting  volatile fraction chromatogram was 23.83 %, ergo about 14 times higher  than in the volatile fraction derived from the optimal MAHD test. Fiorini  et al. (2020) likewise noted higher CBD yield in CHD volatile fraction,

when compared to MAHD. The analysed sample showed traces of THC as  well, proving the harshness of the protocol. Considering the very low  yield in the desired volatile fraction, the residual water was not tested  for polyphenolic content.  
3.3. Volatile fraction analysis  
3.3.1. Volatiles from MAHD  
A qualitative analysis of the terpenes was performed using the GC MS system, matching 93.6 % of the overall composition by the com parison with standard compounds and mass spectra libraries (quality  ≥95 %). The non-assigned compounds show very low area percentages  and poor libraries quality matching (<<95 %). Hence, they were  assumed to be barely significant. The compounds contained in the  sample that was obtained from the optimized MAHD Test 2 are listed in  Table 3, and are expressed as relative peak areas on the GC-MS chro matogram. A detailed report of retention times and mass fragmentations  for every detected compound is reported by Gunjevi´c et al. (2020).  Whereas the relative percent area of CBD has already been reported in  the paragraph 3.3.1., it was not shown in Table 3.  
As can be seen from Table 3, the prevailing terpenoids with highest  peak areas are as follows: monoterpenes: α-pinene, β-myrcene, β-oci mene; and sesquiterpenes: E-caryophyllene, α-humulene, caryophyllene  oxide, and β-selinene. These are the compounds typically present in the  volatile hydrodistillate of European Cannabis sativa L. (Brenneisen,  2007). α-Pinene has a characteristic pine fragrance and exhibits anti septic properties. β-Myrcene is characterized by a musky fragrance as  well as antioxidant and chemo-protective effects. Caryophyllene has a  peppery fragrance, and gastro-protective and anti-inflammatory bio logical activity (Leghissa et al., 2018). Moreover, it is a Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) approved food additive. Caryophyllene oxide is  used as the marker compound for marijuana detection by trained dogs

(Fiorini et al., 2019).  
Fiorini et al. (2020) performed MAHD of Cannabis volatiles,  obtaining a CBD enriched volatile fraction. The main components pre sent in this extract were caryophyllene, CBD, α-humulene, α-pinene,  caryophyllene oxide and myrcene. Therefore, the recovered terpenes  composition is similar to Test 2 extract, even if composition deviations  are observed.  
As already mentioned, the extraction that gave the highest hydro distillate yield (Test 2) was repeated in order to observe how the  composition profile evolves during extraction (Test 13). The terpenic  fraction was sampled six times after the onset of distillation. After  sampling, the florentine vase was thoroughly washed with acetone and  water to avoid the remaining compounds interfering with the following  sample. No significant changes in general terpene trend in relation to  extraction time were noted. However, the trend of the percent areas of  the main monoterpenes (α-pinene, β-myrcene, β-ocimene) and sesqui 
terpenes (E-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and caryophyllene oxide) was  investigated (see Table 4 and Fig. 5) at each sampling time. For the sake  of comparison, percentage areas were normalized exclusively in relation  to the abovementioned compounds.  
On Fig. 5 it can be seen that on average, the monoterpenes relative  area constantly increased according to extraction time, while the E caryophyllene, α-humulene, and caryophyllene oxide area decreased;  during extraction, monoterpene area overtakes the decreasing sesqui terpene percent area. Nevertheless, lighter terpenes were the most  abundant compounds in all of the analysed samples. Subsequently, all of  the fractions were united and analysed by GC-MS to verify the overall  composition in respect to the Test 2. The prevalent terpenes percent  areas were found to be quite comparable with the terpenes from the  volatile fraction that was obtained in the optimal MAHD test.  
The decreasing trend of sesquiterpene relative area during extraction  may be related to the progressive depletion of the matrix, as the lower  quantity of these compounds in hemp inflorescences is well known  (Aizpurua-Olaizola et al., 2016; Booth et al., 2017). Monoterpenes,  which are usually predominant, are even more pronounced in the  extracted matrix, due to the post-harvesting strategies. CBD, whose  percent area trend is shown for every sample in Fig. 5, was found to be  present across all the sampling times, with correlated percent area  changes during extraction. The reported plot shows a gradual increase in  CBD area on GC-MS chromatogram over extraction time. When the  sampled fractions were combined, the CBD percent area was 2.29 %,  which is comparable to the optimal MAHD test.  
3.3.2. Volatiles from CHD  
The Cannabis volatile fraction profile obtained by means of CHD is  reported in Table 5. Since the percent area of CBD in CHD extract’s  chromatogram has already been reported in the paragraph 3.2.2., it was  not shown in this Table. Predominant compounds found in the gas 
chromatographic profile include: E-caryophyllene, caryophyllene  oxide, α-humulene, β-selinene, and α-bisabolol. It is immediately clear  that terpenoid fraction is characterized by a reduced variety, if  compared with MAHD product. More in detail, a much higher contri

Gulluni et al. (2018) analysed Cannabis essential oil belonging to the  same variety studied in this work (Cannabis sativa L. cv. Monoica),  prepared through CHD. The essential oil’s prevalent compounds, in  particular myrcene, terpinolene, caryophyllene, β-humulene, β-oci

3.4. Water after MAHD – analysis  
The water added to the Cannabis plant material before the extraction  
was, in the most cases, around 2.5 L in quantity. As is already known,  
MW solid/liquid extraction is widely used in the field of green extraction  
(Chemat et al., 2019). Polyphenols are some of today’s most interesting  
phytochemicals. They possess several biological effects, including anti 
oxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and chemo-preventive power  
(Cravotto et al., 2018). The MW-assisted extraction of hemp polyphenols  
has been described in several papers. Teh et al. (2014) have investigated  
the use of MW as a prior step to US-assisted polyphenol extraction from  
defatted hemp seed cake. The results have shown that the irradiation of  
this residue can enhance the metabolites extraction, maximizing the  
polyphenols yield. Drini´c et al. (2020) unified the aforementioned ap 
proaches, developing an optimization of hemp MAE for phenols, flavo 
noids, and phytocannabinoids in ethanol. In this case, MAE was found to

be a simple, fast, and efficient extraction method for the cited classes of  metabolites, preserving at the same time the high antioxidant activity of  the extract.  
Therefore, the liquid fraction after the optimized MAHD Test 2 was  analysed in order to evaluate its total polyphenols content (TPC). This  value, estimated using the Folin–Ciocalteu test, was found to be 1.49 ± 0.02 mg polyphenols/g matrix and 53.54 ± 2.35 mg polyphenols/g  extract. Hence, the obtained extract contained 5.35 ± 0.23 %, w/w of  polyphenols.

reported here.  
Similarly to MAHD test, the CBD percent peak area (from GC-MS) has  been exploited to express the selectivity of volatiles extraction by CHD,  surprisingly being 23.83 %. This value indicates a higher amount of  phytocannabinoids in the essential oil in respect to the MAHD volatile  fraction, thus may limit the applicability of the CHD product.  
theless, phenolic acids have also been detected in Cannabis plant (Izzo  et al., 2020). Therefore, HPLC-DAD was used to analyse polyphenols  belonging to the aforesaid classes present in the enriched sample. Two  main peaks were identified, on the basis of standard compounds, as  flavone products, namely luteolin-7-O-glucoside and  apigenin-7-O-glucoside, with an amount of 2.84 ± 0.12 %, w/w and  2.58 ± 0.11 %, w/w, respectively, when calculated in relation to the dry  purified water fraction. Moreover, the absorption spectrum of each  compound detected was thoroughly revised. In particular, six signals,  besides luteolin and apigenin glucosides, were detected at 340 nm and  featured a spectrum that is characteristic for flavones, as reported in  Gunjevi´c et al. (2020). However, the lack of specific standards means  that identification and quantification were impossible. In agreement  with previous investigations the main polyphenols in low-THC Cannabis  cultivars were flavones (Brenneisen, 2007).  
Thanks to their additive nutritional value, flavones have received  
9

V. Gunjevi´c et al. 
increased attention in recent years. Their main activity is their ability to  scavenge oxygen species that contain free radicals that cause oxidative  stress (Jiang et al., 2016). Moreover, their beneficial effects on the  prevention of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and some other chronic  diseases, such as asthma, cataracts, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis,  have been reported (Graf et al., 2005).  
The global polyphenol market was valued at USD 1.28 billion in  2018 and is expected to grow by 7.2 % from 2019 to 2025 (GVR, 2019),  therefore, this by-product of MAHD can be considered as a valuable and  cheap source for the isolation of some of these natural compounds.  
3.5. Cannabinoid MAHG extraction  
Reflux is the conventional extraction method to achieve cannabi noids recovery from Cannabis inflorescence (Baranauskaite et al., 2020;  De Vita et al., 2020). It entails a long extraction time and ineffective  conductive heating. Moreover, it requires ethanol, a widely used but  potentially flammable solvent. A preliminary MAHG test was performed  to evaluate the possibility of overcoming the disadvantages of the  classical extraction approach. Steam was introduced into the MW cavity  to enhance the extraction efficiency by the continuous stripping and to  supply water onto plant material. The fresh inflorescence MAHG gave a  dry extract of 4.65 ± 0.26 % w/w on dry inflorescence, with CBD and  THC content of 0.008 ± 0.001 % and 0.001 ± 0.001 %. These results  correspond to a CBD and THC extraction yield of 0.01 ± 0.001 % and  0.04 ± 0.005 %, respectively, when expressed as matrix depletion ratio.  Therefore, the matrix depletion of cannabinoids is inefficient when  MAHG is applied.  
4. Conclusion  
More than 2.5 kg per cycle of Cannabis plant material was efficiently  processed by MAHD in a 12 L Pyrex® vessel. The hydrodistilled oil was  extremely rich in the characteristic Cannabis terpenes: α-pinene,  β-myrcene, β-ocimene, E-caryophyllene, α-humulene, caryophyllene  oxide, and β-selinene. Furthermore, the absence of solvents strengthens  the sustainability of the whole process, as benign by design. Sampling  collected during MAHD showed a progressive enrichment in mono 
terpenes and a decrease in sesquiterpene during the process. The volatile  fraction yield and profile from MAHD were compared with those ob tained from CHD, for which the oil amount was considerably lower, also  having a different volatiles fingerprint.  
After MAHD the residual biomass still contain most phytocannabi noids, which mainly result decarboxylated. Hence, residual hemp, un altered from MAHD protocol, is suitable for subsequent cannabinoid  recovery. Furthermore, the heating water in the biomass vessel resulted  reach in polyphenols. The two main metabolites, namely luteolin-7-O glucoside and apigenin-7-O-glucoside, were identified and quantified by  means of HPLC-DAD.  
In conclusion, the present investigation using a pilot scale MW  reactor provided terpenes rich hydrodistillate, an enriched polyphenols  fraction from the undistilled water and phytocannabinoids with a high  level of decarboxylation degree.
