Abstract: Greenhouse-grown cannabis (Cannabis sativa L., marijuana) plants with yellowing, crown rot and root-browning symptoms  were sampled from six production facilities during 2019–2020. Among 34 fungal isolates recovered, 28 were identified as Fusarium  solani and six isolates were provisionally identified as Cylindrocarpon sp. based on morphology. These latter isolates produced slow growing colonies with grey-white aerial mycelium and a chestnut-brown colour below. Cylindrical 1–3 septate conidia without  a distinctive foot cell were produced. Microconidia were absent and chlamydospores were produced in culture. Phylogenetic analysis of  three isolates based on the elongation factor (TEF-1 α) and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions identified them as Fusarium lichenicola (formerly  Cylindrocarpon lichenicola), a member of F. solani species complex (FSSC) subclade 16. Pathogenicity tests using a mycelial and spore  suspension were performed on cannabis cuttings and rooted plants. Isolates of F. solani originating from diseased crowns caused  symptoms in 10–14 days, while those of F. lichenicola caused yellowing and wilting after 3 weeks, suggesting that F. lichenicola is less  virulent. Inoculum of F. lichenicola was detected in coco coir samples used for plant propagation. Previous reports of F. lichenicola are  from tropical climates, where the fungus has been associated with dermal and ocular infections of human tissues, with a few reports of it  causing diseases on pomelo fruits, taro corms and tea plants. This study demonstrates the first occurrence worldwide of F. lichenicola on  cannabis plants, on which it is considered a weak introduced tropical pathogen, likely to have originated from coco coir imported into  Canada.

Résumé: Des plants de cannabis (Cannabis sativa L., marijuana) cultivés en serre, provenant de six installations de production et affichant  des symptômes de jaunissement, de pourriture du collet et de pourriture brune des racines, ont été échantillonnés en 2019-2020. Parmi les 34  isolats récupérés, 28 ont été identifiés en tant que Fusarium solani et 6 l’ont été provisoirement, en se basant sur leur morphologie, en tant  que Cylindrocarpon sp. Ces derniers ont produit des colonies à croissance lente dont le mycélium aérien était gris-blanc et le dessous,  
marron. Des conidies cylindriques comportant de 1 à 3 septums, sans cellule basale distincte, ont été produites. Il n’y avait pas de  microconidies et des chlamydospores ont été produits en culture. L’analyse phylogénétique de trois isolats, basée sur le facteur d’élongation  (TEF-1 α) et les régions ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, a permis de les identifier en tant que Fusarium lichenicola (précédemment Cylindrocarpon  lichenicola), un membre du complexe d’espèces de F. solani (FSSC), sous-clade 16. Des tests de pathogénicité utilisant une suspension de  mycélium et de spores ont été menés sur des boutures de cannabis et des plants enracinés. Les isolats de F. solani provenant des collets  infectés ont causé des symptômes en 10 à 14 jours, tandis que F. lichenicola a causé le jaunissement et le flétrissement au bout de trois  semaines, ce qui suggère que ce dernier est moins virulent. L’inoculum de F. lichenicola a été détecté dans des échantillons de fibre de coco  utilisée pour propager les plants. Les rapports antérieurs sur F. lichenicola proviennent de climats tropicaux où le champignon a été associé à  des infections cutanées et oculaires chez l’humain, de même qu’à des maladies chez les pomélos, les cormes de taro et les théiers.

Introduction 
Members of the Fusarium solani species complex  (FSSC), also referred to in this study as F. solani, are  prevalent in diverse environments around the world and  are commonly found in soil as decomposers of plant  materials (Zhang et al. 2006; Nucci and Anaissie  2007). They also include a large group of important  plant, animal and human pathogens (O’Donnell et al.  2008; Coleman 2016). Molecular analyses have demon strated that FSSC comprises up to 60 phylogenetic spe 
cies that are distributed among three major clades  (Schroers et al. 2016). Members of FSSC clade 3 (with  at least 34 distinct species) are the most common group  of fusaria associated with plant diseases and human  infections in North America (O’Donnell et al. 2008).  They include at least 20 clinically relevant phylogeneti 
cally distinct species and account for approximately two thirds of all invasive fusarial infections (Zhang et al.  2006; O’Donnell et al. 2007, 2008). Many of these are  opportunistic causal agents of diseases on humans that  produce symptoms ranging from onychomycoses, to skin  and eye infections, to deep localized and disseminated  infections (fusarioses) (Nucci and Anaissie 2007; van  Diepeningen et al. 2014). The members of the FSSC  which infect plants cause diseases, mostly root and  crown rots and vascular wilts, on a wide range of plants,  including soybeans, potato, cucurbits, peas, sweet potato  and various legumes (Coleman 2016; Summerell 2019). 
On cannabis (Cannabis sativa L., marijuana), several  species of Fusarium are reported to cause root and  crown rots under greenhouse conditions. These include  F. oxysporum (Punja 2021b), F. proliferatum (Punja  2021c), as well as F. solani (Punja and Rodriguez  2018). The diseases caused by the former two species  have been described in detail recently, yet there are no  previous studies showing the extent to which F. solani  (FSSC) is present on cannabis plants and the symptoms  of disease. In this study, 34 isolates of FSSC were  recovered from plant samples originating from six can nabis licenced production facilities during 2019–2020.  The objectives of this research were to characterize these  isolates by conducting growth and pathogenicity studies,  as well as phylogenetic analysis. The majority (28 iso lates) were shown to be F. solani, while six were  
Cylindrocarpon lichenicola and Neocosmospora licheni cola), also a member of the FSSC (Summerbell and  Schroers 2002; Sandoval-Denis and Crous 2018). This  represents the first report worldwide of F. lichenicola  infecting C. sativa. 
Materials and methods 
Plant samples 
Cannabis plants with symptoms of stunted growth,  crown discoloration, yellowing of lower leaves, and  browning and decay of roots (Figs 1, 2), were sampled  from commercial greenhouses in British Columbia (five  licenced facilities) and Ontario (one facility) in accor 
dance with Health Canada requirements. Samples were  obtained from stock (mother) plants, from plants at the  rooting and vegetative growth stages (2–4 weeks of  growth), and at the onset of flowering (week 5 of  growth) (Punja 2021b). A total of 68 symptomatic plants  of 10 strains (genotypes) were included. The sampling  was conducted at various times during February 2019–  June 2020. Plants were propagated in cocofibre (coco  coir) substrate and received the appropriate nutrient  regimes and lighting conditions as recommended for  commercial hydroponic production (Small 2017). The  environmental conditions during sampling were 24–38°C  and relative humidity of 60% to 85%. 
Isolation from plants 
Samples that included crown tissues, root segments, and  stem pieces from plants showing symptoms were used  for pathogen isolation. From each tissue type, small  pieces, ca. 0.5 cm in length for roots or 0.2–0.4 cm2  for cuttings and stem pieces were surface-disinfested by  dipping them in a 10% bleach solution (containing  0.625% NaOCl) for 1 min, followed by 30 s in 70%  EtOH. They were rinsed thrice in sterile water and  blotted on sterile paper towels. Tissue pieces were plated  onto potato dextrose agar (PDA, Sigma Chemicals,  St. Louis, MO) containing 130 mg L−1 streptomycin  sulphate (PDA+S). Dishes containing the tissues were  incubated under ambient laboratory conditions (21–24°C

morphological criteria, including colony colour and size  and microscopic examination of spores; most isolates  were identified as Fusarium and Pythium spp. A few  slow-growing isolates, however, showed a unique colony  morphology and produced white aerial mycelium and

Strains BC-1, BC-2 of F. solani were described in a previous study (Punja and Rodriguez 2018).  
Isolates of Fusarium solani and F. lichenicola in this study were obtained during February 2019 – June 2020 and originated from five cannabis production  facilities in BC (LP-1 to LP-5) and one facility in ON (LP-6). The cannabis strains from which the isolates were obtained, symptoms on the plant, and the  licenced producer (LP) are shown.  
Sequences of isolates shown in bold have been deposited in GenBank with the corresponding accession numbers for TEF-1 α (ITS submission are shown in  brackets): BC-1 = MH844836, BC-2 = MH844837, BC-6 = MN784811, BC-7 = MN784812, BC-9 = MN784800, BC-10 = MT036758, BC 11 = MT036759, BC-12 = (MN852860), BC-13 (MW130737.1), BC-15 = (MN852859), ON-5 = MN784810.  
Molecular identification 
Cultures of all 34 isolates were grown on PDA+S for  2 weeks under ambient laboratory conditions. DNA was  extracted using the QIAGEN DNeasy Plant Mini Kit  (cat. no. 69104) from 10 mg to 50 mg of mycelium  scraped from the colony surface. Species were identified  by PCR using primers for the translation elongation  factor 1α (TEF-1 α) region: TEF- 1 α (5ʹATGGGTA  AGGAGGACAAGAC 3ʹ) and TEF-2 (5ʹ GGAGGTA  CCAGTGATCATGTT 3ʹ) as described by Punja  (2021b). In addition, species-level identification was  also done by conducting PCR of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2  region of ribosomal DNA using 2–50 ng uL−1 DNA.  The ITS region was amplified with the universal eukar yotic primers UN-UP18S42 (5′-  
CGTAACAAGGTTTCCGTAG  
GTGAAC-3′) and UN-LO28S576B (5′-GTTTCTTTTC  CTCCGCTTATTAATATG-3′) as described by Punja  (2021b). PCR products were separated on 1% agarose  gels and bands of the expected size (ca. 700 bp for TEF 
1α and 650 bp for ITS1-ITS2) were cut from the gel and  collected using the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (cat. no.  28604), and 8 uL of DNA was sent to Eurofins Genomics  (Eurofins MWG Operon LLC 2016, Louisville, KY) for  sequencing. The resulting sequences were compared to the  corresponding TEF-1α and ITS1-ITS2 sequences from the  
National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)  GenBank database. Multiple sequence alignment of the  respective isolates was done using the CLUSTAL  W program (http://www.genome.jp/tools/clustalw). Seven  representative isolates were included in a phylogenetic ana 
lysis using the neighbour-joining (NJ) method and  a bootstrap consensus tree was inferred from 1000  replicates as described previously (Punja and  Rodriguez 2018) using MEGA 7.0 (Kumar et al.  2016). The outgroups used were Sclerotinia sclero 
tiorum and Ilyonectria liriodendra. 
Mycelial growth and spore measurements 
To assess the effects of temperature on colony growth, 9-cm  diameter Petri dishes containing 25 mL of PDA were inocu lated with a 5 mm2 mycelial plug taken from 10-day-old  cultures of F. solani originating from crown tissues  (isolate BC-5) and Cylindrocarpon sp. from brown roots  (isolate BC-10). Replicates of 10 Petri dishes were placed  in temperature-controlled incubators maintained at 5, 10, 15,  20, 25, 30 and 35°C. The actual observed temperatures were  within ± 1°C. Colony diameters were measured after  2 weeks of incubation from two perpendicular measure 
ments per colony and averaged. The experiment was con ducted twice and the data averaged and used to calculate  
Z. K. PUNJA et al. 6
standard errors. Spore measurements were made from cul tures grown at 30°C. The length and width of 20 spores were  measured under a compound microscope using  a micrometre and converted to um sizes. 
Pathogenicity studies 
Stem cutting inoculations. For inoculation of stem cut tings, the base of stem segments (15-cm height) from  stock plants of strains ‘Hash Plant’ and ‘White Rhino’  were dipped into a spore suspension of F. solani or  Cylindrocarpon for 5 min and inserted into pre moistened 4 cm2 rockwool cubes (Grodan). The isolate  was previously grown on PDA plates for 7–10 days  under ambient laboratory conditions. The plates were  flooded with 10 mL of sterile distilled water, the colony  surface was rubbed with a glass rod, and the resulting  spore suspension was poured through two layers of  cheesecloth. Water was added as required to achieve  a concentration of 1 × 106 spores mL−1 as quantified in  a haemocytometer. Alternatively, the isolate was grown  in potato dextrose broth shake cultures (each 100 mL)  for 7–10 days at 150 rpm and the mycelial mat from two  flasks was blended with 200 mL of water for 20 s. The  cuttings were dipped into the mycelial + spore suspen 
sion for 3 min. To determine the inoculum level, dilu tions of the mycelial + spore suspension were made in  sterile distilled water (up to 10−5) and 50 uL was spread  onto the surface of PDA+S plates and incubated at  21–24°C for 5 days, at which time colony-forming  units (CFU mL−1) was quantified visually. All rockwool  cubes containing inoculated cuttings were placed inside  a plastic container, a 1 cm layer of water was added, and  covered with a plastic dome to maintain high humidity  and placed in a Conviron incubator set at 24°C with  a 12-hr photoperiod for 2 weeks. Controls consisted of  noninoculated cuttings. For each experimental trial, five  replicate cuttings were used. Symptoms of damping-off  or stem infection of the cuttings was rated weekly over  3 weeks. Re-isolations were made from diseased tissues  following the surface-sterilization procedure described  previously and plating tissues onto PDA+S. The experi ment was conducted twice. 
Rooted plant inoculation. To obtain rooted plants for  pathogenicity testing, stem cuttings (10–15 cm in length)  taken from stock plants of cannabis strains ‘Hash Plant’  and ‘White Rhino’ were placed upright in the polyethy 
lene collar plugs designed to hold them in a TurboKlone  
T24 Turbo mini aeroponic cloning system (Turboklone,  Reno, NV) with a humidity dome. After 3 weeks, the  rooted cuttings were removed from the TurboKlone and  the bottom 10 cm of the root systems were cut with  scissors. The wounded plants were dipped for 5 min  into a spore + mycelial suspension prepared as described  above and then potted in a coco coir: perlite (3:1) potting  medium in 10 cm2 pots. The spore concentration was  determined to be 1.5 × 106 and 1.2 × 106 per mL for  F. solani and Cylindrocarpon, respectively. The pots  were placed in a plastic tray containing a 1 cm layer of  water, covered with a plastic dome to maintain high  humidity, and placed in a Conviron incubator set at 24°  C with a 24-hr photoperiod. Symptoms of yellowing or  stunting of the plants were noted after 1, 2 and 3 weeks.  There were five replicate plants for each pathogen spe cies. The experiment was conducted twice on each of  strains ‘Hash Plant’ and ‘White Rhino’. Re-isolations  were made from diseased tissues following the surface sterilization procedure described previously and tissues  were plated onto PDA+S. 
Results 
Symptoms and pathogen isolation 
Stock (mother) plants from which isolations were made  displayed crown lesions with internal stem browning and  decay (Fig. 1a-c). The development of ‘wet rot’ symptoms  in the stem tissues was observed. Colonies recovered from  diseased stem tissues on PDA+S were whitish-cream in  colour with faint blue streaks (Fig. 1d). Stem tissues origi 
nating from damped-off cuttings (Fig. 1e) and vegetative  plants with yellowing leaves (Fig. 1f) yielded similar colo nies. Based on morphological characteristics (colony  appearance and spore shape), these isolates were identified  as F. solani. From vegetative plants and young flowering  plants with yellowing leaves and dark brown crown lesions  and brown roots (Fig. 2a-c), slow-growing colonies which  produced white aerial mycelium on the surface and were  distinctly reddish-brown to chestnut brown in colour on the  underside were obtained (Fig. 2d-f). These colonies secreted  a brown pigment into the medium. Cylindrical spores pro 
duced in cultures were used to provisionally identify these  colonies as Cylindrocarpon sp. From dilutions made of the  coco growing substrate, similar colonies were recovered  (Fig. 3a); upon subculture, they produced aerial mycelium  on the surface (Fig. 3b) and a distinct pigmentation on the  underside (Fig. 3c) as well as cylindrical multi-septate  spores (Fig. 3d).

Subculture of  the isolate shows typical colony morphology (b, c) and spore production (d). 
Molecular identification 
PCR using the TEF-1 α primers produced a band size of  around 700 bp for all isolates (Fig. 4). The ITS primers  produced a band size of around 650 bp (data not shown).  Sequence comparisons using BLASTn confirmed the iden 
tity of 28 isolates to be F. solani (Table 1); the remaining six  isolates were identified as F. lichenicola. The corresponding  phylogenetic analyses using the TEF-1 sequences showed  that four isolates (BC-7, BC-8, BC-9, ON-5) identified as  F. solani belonged to a large clade of isolates of F. solani  from a wide range of hosts and geographic regions. Three  isolates (BC-6, BC-10, BC-11) identified as F. lichenicola  were clustered with a group of previously reported  F. lichenicola isolates (formerly Cylindrocarpon licheni cola) from diverse sources (Fig. 5). The sequence identity  of isolate BC-6 with F. lichenicola accessions in GenBank  was 99.4% for each of DQ246877 (isolated from human  skin in Thailand), LN827982 (from skin infections in  Colombia) and KP903345.1 (from pomelo fruits in  Thailand). The ITS sequences showed that isolates BC-10  
and BC-11 of F. lichenicola were similarly grouped within  a large clade of isolates of F. lichenicola from diverse  sources and regions worldwide, including human skin tis sues, with sequence identity of 100% (Fig. 6). 
Mycelial growth and spore measurements 
The growth patterns and colony morphologies of  F. lichenicola isolates BC-6, BC-10, and BC-11 on  PDA are shown in Fig. 7. The colony margins were  irregular (Fig. 7a), and when streaked across the agar  surface, the developing colonies produced white aerial  mycelium and had a yellowish-brown pigment with  streaks of violet-blue on the undersurface (Fig. 7d-f).  When a spore suspension was plated onto PDA, distinct  colonies with orange-brown pigmentation were produced  (Fig. 7g, h) compared to those of F. solani in which  pigmentation was absent (Fig. 7i). The effects of tem peratures ranging from 10°C to 40°C on colony growth  of F. solani and F. lichenicola are shown in Fig. 8. There

naturally infected cuttings in the commercial greenhouse  
(Fig. 1e). On rooted plants, the only symptom that  
developed was a yellowing of the leaves on inoculated  
plants compared to the healthy control (Fig. 1f). Stem  
cuttings inoculated with a mycelial + spore suspension of  
F. lichenicola showed yellowing of the leaves after  
2 weeks (Fig. 2g). After 3 weeks, when the cuttings  
were removed from the rockwool block, there was no  
root development compared to the noninoculated control  
(Fig. 2h). Some mycelial growth was evident on the  
stem of the cuttings under high humidity conditions  
(Fig. 2i). On inoculated rooted plants, F. lichenicola  
caused yellowing of the leaves and plants were stunted  
compared to the noninoculated control (Fig. 2j).  
Inoculated plants showed a browning of the root system  
when they were uprooted (Fig. 2k).

was no growth of either species at 10°C or 40°C, and the  optimum temperature for both was 30°C with significant  growth still occurring at 35°C. There was no effect of  temperature on pigmentation of colonies of F. solani but  F. lichenicola developed a brown pigmentation at 30°C  and 35°C (Fig. 8). A comparison of colony growth of  F. solani and F. lichenicola after 1 week and 2 weeks of  incubation at 30°C is shown in Fig. 9a-d. Spores pro duced in cultures grown at 30°C are shown in Fig. 9c, f.  Macroconidia of F. solani were characteristically canoe 
shaped with blunt ends, 1–3 septate and measured 28 –  (32.75) – 35 um in length and 2.8 – (3.27) – 3.5 um in  width. Spores of F. lichenicola were cylindrical, with one  end slightly more tapered, 1–3 septate, and measured  22 – (26.2) −35 um in length and 2 – (2.6) – 3.5 um in  width. When grown in potato dextrose broth, cultures of  F. lichenicola produced a chestnut-brown pigment (Fig.  9g) and abundant spores and chlamydospores were  formed after 2 weeks (Fig. 9h, i). 
Pathogenicity studies 
Stem cutting inoculations. Within 2 weeks of inoculation  with a spore or mycelial + spore suspension of F. solani,  inoculated cuttings developed extensive mycelial growth  on the stem, the leaves began to yellow, and the cuttings  toppled over as the base of the stem was decayed (Fig.  1g). This symptom was identical to that observed in  
Discussion 
The presence of F. solani on decayed roots of cannabis  plants grown hydroponically in indoor controlled envir onments has been previously reported (Punja and  Rodriguez 2018). The pathogen has also been isolated  from the inflorescences of plants at harvest (Punja 2018).  In this study, F. solani was recovered from six cannabis  production facilities located in two provinces by sam pling symptomatic stock plants, rooted cuttings, as well  as plants in the vegetative stage of growth. Since the  symptoms of crown discoloration, damping off, and root  browning overlap with those caused by F. oxysporum  and F. proliferatum reported recently (Punja 2021b,  2021c), fungal isolation and identification was con ducted. Inoculation studies showed that isolates of  F. solani caused root infection, damping-off and yellow ing of plants. The optimal growth in culture was found to  be 30–35°C, which is consistent with other reports (Roy  1997; Daami-Remadi et al. 2006; Yan and Nelson 2020);  some isolates of F. solani are capable of growth at 37°C  (Sugiura et al. 1999). Phylogenetic analyses placed the  isolates of F. solani from cannabis within a large clade of  isolates from a broad range of host species originating  from different countries world-wide. This indicates  a lack of specialization for host preference in the canna bis isolates. 
Among 34 isolates recovered from various cannabis  tissues in this study, 28 were F. solani and six were  F. lichenicola (formerly Cylindrocarpon lichenicola)  based on TEF-1 and ITS sequences. The latter isolates  were very different in colony and spore morphology  from F. solani and were recovered from diseased vege 
tative and flowering plants with symptoms of crown rot

Fig. 6 Phylogenetic analysis of two isolates of Fusarium lichenicola originating from cannabis plants (see Table 1) using ITS-1-ITS2  sequences compared to isolates from other substrates and geographic regions (GenBank numbers are shown).

The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the  branches.

having a conspicuously protuberant, asymmetrical,  truncate base. The isolates were distinct from  Neonectria radicicola (Cylindrocarpon destructans)  based on molecular analysis (Mantiri et al. 2001).  Members of the genus Cylindrocarpon are well-known  plant pathogens that affect a range of woody and her 
baceous plant species worldwide, including in Canada  (Traquair and White 1992; Seifert et al. 2003; Petit  et al. 2011; Úrbez-Torres et al. 2014), and are also  present in soil as saprophytes growing in organic matter  and decaying plant roots (Lawrence et al. 2019). 
Phylogenetic analysis based on sequences of the large  subunit of rDNA of F. lichenicola showed this species is  well placed within a clade mainly consisting of typical  F. solani strains (Summerbell and Schroers 2002). Further  molecular analysis by O’Donnell et al. (2008) placed  F. lichenicola in the FSSC group 16 of clade 3. It is note worthy that FSSC 1, which contains F. solani f. sp. cucurbitae  race 2 (O’Donnell 2000) and FSSC 8 (Neocosmospora vasin 
fecta) were previously the only two species within the FSSC  complex known to be pathogenic on both plants and humans  
(Zhang et al. 2006; Mehl and Epstein 2007). The finding of  F. lichenicola infecting cannabis plants and previous reports  of it causing infections on humans adds a third example.  Members of the FSSC which are able to infect both plants  and humans were placed in the genus Neocomospora by  Sandoval-Denis and Crous (2018); therefore F. lichenicola  has been proposed to be renamed as Neocomospora licheni cola. In this study, the use of F. lichenicola is retained for  consistency. 
Fusarium lichenicola is an opportunistic pathogen of  humans in the tropics, causing chronic cutaneous lesions  through production of keratinolytic enzymes (Mangiaterra  et al. 2001; Kaben et al. 2006). In India, F. lichenicola was  reported to cause localized cutaneous infection on the hands  of an immune-compromised patient which resulted from  contact with infested soil while working in the field  (Champa et al. 2013). The images of the fungal colony and  spores in that study are identical to those presented here. The  spectrum of infections reported to be caused by  F. lichenicola in humans is similar to those caused by  F. solani and includes ocular infections, post-traumatic

keratitis, cutaneous lesions, disseminated infections in  immune-compromised patients, and peritonitis in patients  on peritoneal dialysis (James et al. 1997; Sharma et al.  1998; Summerbell and Schroers 2002; Villalobas et al.  2003; Chazan et al. 2004). 
The discovery of F. lichenicola on diseased cannabis  plants in two production facilities in British Columbia and  its detection in coco coir growing medium suggest it was  likely introduced from a tropical country, which manufac 
tures coco coir for export to Canada. The ability to produce  chlamydospores likely ensures survival of the pathogen for  extended periods. The fungus is most commonly reported  from tropical regions worldwide and is rarely found in  temperate climates (Iwen et al. 2000). The recovery of  F. lichenicola from cannabis plants represents the first  
occurrence worldwide. It is considered to be a weak intro duced pathogen, causing root and crown rot on infected  plants, likely through wounds. Previously, the pathogen  had been isolated from pomelo fruits grown in Vietnam, as  a post-harvest pathogen during shipment, causing water soaking and soft rot symptoms on fruits of Citrus spp.  (Amby et al. 2015). The TEF-1 sequence identity between  this isolate and the one from cannabis was 99.4%. Other  reports of F. lichenicola infecting plant species are from  Papua New Guinea causing root infection on tea (Camellia  sinensis) plants (Shaw 1984) and from India causing corm  rot on taro (Colocasia esculenta) (Usharani and Ramarao  1981). The host range of F. lichenicola beyond these  reported hosts is undetermined. The optimal environmental  conditions for infection have not been studied but disease

development was observed at temperatures of 30–35°C that  are also optimal for pathogen growth; wounding of roots  may predispose plants to infection. 
During commercial cannabis production, the potential  concerns over spread of F. lichenicola to humans should  
be considered in the same context as that for F. solani,  a widely distributed pathogen (Zhang et al. 2006) which  is also found in greenhouses (as shown in this study) and  in controlled environment rooms (Punja and Rodriguez  2018). A majority of affected persons succumbing to

infection by these Fusarium spp. have compromised  immune systems or other underlying health conditions  (Zhang et al. 2006; Altibi et al. 2020). Since the fungus  can cause cutaneous infections on exposed tissues,  appropriate biosecurity measures should be in place  when handling coco coir (or soil) during transplanting.  A recent study (Altibi et al. 2020) described a rare case  of cutaneous onychomycosis infection by a putative  Fusarium sp. in a patient with underlying hyper-IgE  syndrome i.e. Job syndrome, an immunodeficiency syn drome with increased susceptibility to cutaneous fungal  infections (Belcher et al. 2017). The patient, who  admitted to cultivating cannabis plants that were  ‘damaged by mold’, displayed cutaneous infection on  
the lower right knee, suggesting a soil-borne source of  inoculum, likely F. solani. This report, however, was  suggestive and not confirmatory as the causal agent  was not isolated in culture and identified (Altibi et al.  2020). Belcher et al. (2017) reported F. solani to be the  cause of a similar cutaneous infection on the forearm of  a patient with Job syndrome. 
Other potentially harmful fungi, such as species of  Aspergillus and Penicillium (Punja et al. 2019), which  cause respiratory and other health problems in humans  (Vujanovic et al. 2020), can also be found from coco coir  samples originating from tropical countries, if they are  not adequately sterilized. These contaminants can subse 
quently be found on harvested and dried cannabis

inflorescences (Punja 2021a). Fusarium lichenicola  accounted for only 1.3% of all Fusarium spp. recovered  from cannabis plants during 2017–2020. It has not been  detected in air samples or on dried cannabis inflores 
cences sold for medical or recreational purposes sampled  from more than 12 licenced facilities (Punja 2018,  2021a, 2021b). Therefore, F. lichenicola represents an  interesting but rare occurrence of an introduced tropical  pathogen to the cannabis industry in Canada.
