1. Introduction  
ABSTRACT  
Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient required for many central metabolic processes, and is therefore a  major factor governing plant development, structure and function. Cannabis is a short-day plant that its’  development progression involves a vegetative growth phase under long photoperiod, followed by a reproductive  phase under a short photoperiod. The reproductive inflorescence yield potential in cannabis is therefore largely  dependent on the morphology and physiological condition of the plants at the vegetative phase. Due to legal  restrictions, there is lack of science-based knowledge about cannabis plant science, including mineral nutrition.  The present study therefore focused on P nutrition of plants at the vegetative growth phase under long photo period. The plants were cultivated in pots in a controlled environment and subjected to 5 levels of P (5, 15, 30,  60, 90 mg L− 1). We investigated impact on the ionome, physiological and morphological traits, uptake of nu 
trients into the plant, translocation to the shoot, and distribution in the plant organs for 2 medicinal cannabis  genotypes. Plant biomass production, photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and inter cellular CO2 at the vegetative growth phase exceled under 30 mg L− 1 P supply. Uptake and translocation of  nutrients from root to the shoot was highly influenced by the P treatment. Under excess P supply, most of the  plant P accumulated in the roots, and translocation to the shoot was inhibited. Uptake of Mg into the plants, and  its’ translocation to the shoot was inhibited by P deficiency in both cultivars, and was enhanced by increased P  supply. Calcium uptake was increased by P application but translocation to the shoot was inhibited. Zinc  retention in roots under P deficiency was found in both varieties. Our results suggest a wide optimum range for P  in medicinal cannabis at the vegetative growth stage, with a minimum requirement of 15 mg L− 1 P and a rec 
ommended application of 30 mg L− 1. The functional physiology and ionome profiling revealed genotypic vari ability in P sensitivity.

For thousands of years humanity has utilized and cultivated the  Cannabis sativa plant for its therapeutic and nutritional value (Caplan  et al., 2017), psychoactive properties, as a source of fibers (Chandra  et al., 2017) and for spiritual purposes (Small, 2018). Cannabis is an  annual short-day plant originating in Central Asia. Under a long  photoperiod, it undergoes vegetative growth that determines its size,  architecture and the potential for reproductive growth under short  photoperiod. The species contains hundreds of secondary metabolites  that elicit pharmacological effects, including cannabinoids, terpenoids  and flavonoids that are biosynthesized at high concentrations in the  female flower (Flores-Sanches and Verpoorte, 2008; Caplan et al., 2017;  Bernstein et al., 2019a). Though Western medicine has known the

chemical properties (Bernstein et al., 2019b) and horticultural man agement (Caplan et al., 2017). This is due to legal restrictions that  prevented almost all scientific work since the 1950th (Small, 2018).  Until recently, plant-science and agronomical knowledge was confined  to underground communication among clandestine growers (Decorte  and Potter, 2015). Some scientific evidence was obtained in research on  hemp growth; however, since hemp was bred and grown for fiber and  seed production and not for the chemical compounds in the flowers, the  relevance of the accumulated information for the drug-type plant is  limited (Caplan et al., 2017). Lately, owing to an increase in global  demand, C. sativa cultivation has spread throughout the industrialized  world, and there is an increasing need for credible scientific agricultural

expertise of the crop (Decorte and Potter, 2015; Caplan et al., 2017).  In order to harness a plant’s potential, genetic and environmental  factors has to be considered, that together determine plant morphology  (Gottlieb, 1984) and physiology (Sultan, 2000). Abiotic factors such as  mineral nutrition have a considerable effect on plant development,  synthesis of secondary metabolites (Gorelick and Bernstein, 2014) and  yield production (Engels et al., 2012). For more than 2000 years farmers  have been adding minerals to the soil to improve plant growth, and the  benefits of fertilization are well documented (Kirkby, 2012). Phosphorus  (P) is an essential macronutrient that is required for plant metabolism  and growth. Along with its function as a structural element in phos pholipids and nucleic acids, it plays a key role in carbohydrate trans location in-planta as well as in intracellular energy transfer. Due to its  important role as an energy carrier, P takes part in many key biosyn thetic pathways such as fatty acid synthesis, aerobic respiration,  photosynthesis, and glycolysis (White and Hammond, 2008). Under P  deficiency, leaves undergo premature senescence, shoot growth is  inhibited, and the formation of reproductive organs and flower initiation  is delayed. Those limiting factors can cause a decrease in reproductive  development and yield under P deficiency (Hawkesford et al., 2012). In  the medical cannabis industry flowers are the yield, and the lack of in formation pertaining to the response of cannabis to P nutrition at the  vegetative and reproductive stages limit the development of optimal  fertigation practices.  
The little information available on mineral nutrition of medical  cannabis is from forensic studies that aimed to identify illegal growers  by tracing correlations between mineral contents in the plant and the  soil it was grown in, as an effort to identify the origin of the illicit  cultivation sites (Coffman and Gentner, 1977). Coffman and Gentner  (1977) found that P in soil was negatively correlated with K, N, Ca, Mn  and B concentrations in leaves and plant growth was positively corre 
lated with tissue P levels; plants were taller, and their dry weight  increased. The same study identified positive correlation between CBD  and THC production and P accumulation. A recent study from our lab  showed that the addition of P fertilization reduced plant height as well  as inflorescence length by 23.5 % and increased the level of Ca in the  flower along with Zn in all the studied tissues. P supplement did not alter  cannabinoid concentration in the flowers but decreased their concen 
tration in the inflorescence leaves (Bernstein et al., 2019b).  Studies with industrial hemp showed that hemp responses to P  fertilization vary between growing conditions and cultivars. When the  initial P concentration in the soil is relatively high, the addition of P has  a limited effect (Vera et al., 2004, 2010; Aubin et al., 2015). Vera et al.  (2004) found that plant height was impacted by P supply but had no  effect on biomass and yield production. A long term field fertilization  experiment established the optimal P concentration for fiber hemp to be  0.5− 0.6 % P in plant tissues, whereas higher concentrations led to yield  reduction (Ivanyi, ´ 2005; Ivanyi ´ and Izsaki, ´ 2009). The optimum P  application rate was reported to be 85− 95 kg ha− 1 for high fiber yield in  industrial hemp (Deng et al., 2019). Although work on hemp showed  that P application had a limiting impact on the plant, the effects on  medicinal cannabis may vary as they are bred for a different use and  morphological development.  
The present study focused on the interplay between P nutrition and  morpho-physiology in ’drug-type’ medical cannabis under a long  photoperiod. The hypothesis guiding the workplan was that P nutrition  elicit morpho- physiological changes in the plant, inducing develop 
mental modifications that will be linked to changes in the tissue ionome.  To test this hypothesis, we conducted a comparative physiological  functional phenotyping of the response of two medical cannabis geno types to P inputs ranging from 5 to 90 mg L− 1 P, as well as chemical  profiling of the plant ionome. This P concentration range was selected  with the aim to include concentrations from P deficiency to oversupply.  Understanding the factors that influence cannabis morpho-development  at the vegetative growth phase is essential for achieving optimal plant  architecture at the initiation of the reproductive phase.  
2. Materials and methods  
2.1. Plant material and growing conditions  
The plants were propagated from a single mother plant, by cuttings.  Two commercial medicinal cannabis cultivars were studied ‘Desert  Queen’ (DQ) and ‘Royal Medic’ (RM) (Teva Adir LTD, Israel). The  selected cultivars represent a distinct chemotypes; DQ is a high THC  variety, and RM is a ‘balanced’ variety that contains similar concen 
trations of THC and CBD. Coconut fiber plugs were used for propagation  (Jiffy international AS, Kristiansand, Norway) and transplanted in 3 L  plastic pots in perlite (Perlite 2 (1.2), Agrekal, Habonim Israel). The  plants were grown in a controlled growing rooms under long photope 
riod (18/6 h light/dark), 25 ◦C, and irradiated with Metal halide bulbs  (400 μmol m− 2 s− 1; Solis Tek Inc, Carson, California; 25.9 mol m− 2 d− 1).  Carbon dioxide concentration was ~400 ppm. Irrigation was supplied  via 1 L h− 1 discharge-regulated drippers (Netafim, Tel-aviv, Israel); the  volume of irrigation was set to allow 30 % of drainage. Following 7 days  of adjustment to the cultivation setup, when the plants’ height was  11–12 cm they were divided to 5 treatments and were cultivated until  the termination of the experiment 30 days thereafter under increasing P  treatments of 5, 15, 30, 60, 90 mg L-1. The irrigation solution contained  (in mM) 10.42 N-NO3-, 2.07 N-NH4+, 2.56 K+, 2.99 Ca+2, 1.44 Mg+2,  1.47 S-SO4− 2, 0.06 Cl-, 0.021 Fe+2, 0.011 Mn+2, 0.009 B+3, 0.005 Zn+2,  0.0008 Cu+2, 0.0003 Mo+2. Micronutrients were supplied chelated with  EDTA (Barkoret, ICL, Haifa, Israel). The experiment was conducted in a  randomized experimental design, with 5 replicated plants per treatment.  Results of routine monitoring of P concentrations in the irrigation so lutions confirmed that the concentrations followed the target concen trations for the various treatments, and were steady throughout the  experiment. The measurements were conducted with 5 replications,  following the experimental design.  
2.2. Mineral analysis  
The plants were harvested at the termination of the experiment for  inorganic mineral analysis, rinsed in distilled water and separated into  leaves, stems and roots. Dry biomass was determined after drying at 65 ◦C for 72 h. Two extraction methods were used for the analyses of the  mineral concentrations in the plant. For Mg, Ca, Zn, Mn, Cu, and Fe  analysis, the ground dry tissue was digested with HNO3 (65 %) and  HClO4 (70 %). For the extraction of N, P and K, the dry tissue was  digested with H2SO4 (98 %) and H2O2 (70 %). Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu  were analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAnalyst  400 AA Spectrometer, Perkin Elmer, USA). N and P were measured with  an autoanalyzer (Lachat Instruments, WI, USA) and K was measured  with a flame-photometer (410 Flame Photometer Range, Sherwood  Scientific Limited, The Paddocks, UK). Concentrations in leachates and  irrigation solutions were analyzed as is detailed above for the digestion  and extraction solutions.  
In order to estimate the effect of P on uptake into the plant, and root  to shoot translocation, a bioaccumulation coefficient (BC) (L Kg-1), and a  translocation factor (TF) were calculated by Eqs. (1) and (2), respec tively, following Liu et al. (2009).

2.3. Physiological parameters  
Sampling for physiological measures was conducted 26 days  following the initiation of the fertigation treatments.

2.3.1. Determination of carotenoids and chlorophyll content  Five leaf discs, 6 mm in diameter from the youngest mature fan leaf  on the plant main stem were placed in ethanol (80 % (v/v), 0.8 mL) and  kept in − 20 ◦C until further analysis. For extraction of the pigments form  the tissue, the tubes containing the samples were heated for 30 min at 95 ◦C. After collection of the solution, 0.5 mL of 80 % (v/v) ethanol was  added to the remaining tissue, and the tubes were heated again for 30  min. The combined extract was mixed by vortex; 0.4 mL was diluted in 5  mL (v/v) acetone. Absorbance was measured at 663, 664 and 740 nm by  a UV Scanning spectrophotometer (Bernstein et al., 2010) (Genesys 10,  Thermo scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) שד. The photosynthetic  pigments Chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids were calculated following  Lichtenthaler and Welburn (1983).  
2.3.2. Plant structure and development  
The number of nodes on the main stem, stem diameter and plant  height, were measured every week throughout the experiment for 5  replicated plants per treatment. The diameter of the stem was measured  1 cm above the base of the plant with a digital caliper (YT-7201, Signet  tools international co., LTD., Shengang Distric, Taiwan). Biomass of the  vegetative shoot organs was measured by destructive sampling at the  end of the experiment. Fresh weight of leaves, stem and roots was  measured immediately following dissection from the plants, and dry  biomass was measured following desiccation at 65 ◦C for 72 h.  
2.3.3. Photosynthesis and transpiration rate, intercellular CO2  concentration, stomatal conductance, and intrinsic water use efficiency  Gas exchange parameters were analyzed on the youngest-mature leaf  on the main stem (6400 XT, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA), for 5 replicate  plants per treatment. For the measurements, PPFD, temperature and  carbon dioxide concentration were 500 μm m− 2s− 1, 29 ◦C and 400 ppm,  respectively. Intrinsic Water use efficiency (Leaf water use efficiency,  iWUE) was calculated as the ratio between the results obtained for net  photosynthesis and stomatal conductance.  
3. Results  
3.1. Plant growth and development  
Biomass accumulation into leaves, stems and roots increased with  the elevation of P supply up to the concentration of 30 mg L− 1 P (Fig. 1A,  B) and was unaffected by further increase. In both cultivars, the per centage of DW in the plant organs was highest under 5 mg L− 1 P supply  (Fig. 1C, D).  
All measured morphological parameters, stem diameter, number of  nodes on the main stem, plant height and the calculated elongation rate,  had a similar response trend to the increase in P supply. DQ requires  more P for optimal development than RM, and its development was  restricted under both 5 mg L− 1 and 15 mg L− 1 P supply, while for RM  restricted development was observed only under 5 mg L− 1 P (Fig. 2).  Plant height, number of nodes on the main stem and stem diameter were  reduced under low P supply. Plant height did not differ statistically (P > 0.01) at the concentration range of 15− 90 mgL− 1 P in RM, and 30–90 in  DQ. Stem diameter was reduced in both varieties only under 5 mg L− 1 P  supply, by 30 % in RM and 50 % in DQ compared to the 90 mg L− 1  treatment.  
3.2. Gas exchange and photosynthesis  
In both varieties, photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, stomatal  conduction and internal CO2 concentrations were lowest under  restricted P supply, and increased with the increase in concentration up  to 30 mg L− 1 P (Fig. 3). Further increase in P reduced these gas-exchange  parameters, except photosynthesis rate in RM that was not affected.  Unlike DQ, RM plants didn’t show a significant response to an increasing  concentration from 5 mg L− 1 to 15 mg L− 1 in stomatal conductance,  transpiration rate and intercellular CO2 (Fig. 3B, D-E). Water Use Effi ciency (WUEi) was highest under P deficiency and lowest at the 30 mg  L− 1 treatment in both cultivars, and was higher in DQ than in RM  (Fig. 3C).

Asterisk above the means represent significant  differences between the P supply treatments for a given day by Tukey HSD test (α = 0.05).  
P supply affected the concentration of the photosynthetic pigments  differently in the two varieties. In DQ, the concentrations were overall  higher under low P supply compared to the highest supply of 90 mg L− 1.  In RM, the response of chlorophyll a and b to the increase in P supply  followed a maximum curve, with the lowest values under 5 and 90 mg  L− 1 supply (Fig. 4A-B), and the response of the carotenoid concentra tions was similar to DQ, i.e., higher under 5 mg L− 1 P compared to 90 mg  L− 1 supply (Fig. 4C).  
3.3. Macronutrients concentration  
The concentration of the macronutrients varied between the  different organs, and were influenced by the level of P input. In both  cultivars, P concentration in the leaves, stem and the root increased with  the increase in concentration of P in the nutrient solution, and the order  
of concentration was roots > leaves > stems (Figs. 5B, 6 B). In both  cultivars, the increase in root’s P was up to the level of 60 mg L− 1 P  supply, and the stem presented a genotypic specificity, with an increase  in tissue P up to the level of 90 and 30 mg L− 1 P supply, in RM and DQ,  respectively (Figs. 5B, 6 B). Unlike P that showed preferential accumu 
lation in the root (Figs. 5B, 6 B), K, N, Ca, and Mg, presented high level of  translocation to the shoot (Figs. 5 and 6). The order of N and Mg con centrations were leaves > roots > stems while Ca and K accumulated  mainly in the stem and leaves (Figs. 5 and 6).  
Potassium and N accumulation varied between the two cultivars. In  DQ, P supply did not affect the concentrations of K and N in the leaves  and the stems, while in RM the concentrations elevated with the increase  in P input up to the supply level of 30 mg L− 1 P. The effect on K and N  concentration in the root was also genotype specific; in RM, a maximum  trend was apparent for the response to P supply, with the highest value  
4 
Industrial Crops & Products 161 (2021) 113154 
S. Shiponi and N. Bernstein 
under 15 mg L− 1 P supply, while in DQ the concentrations were highest  under 60 and 5 mg L− 1 P supply (Figs. 5 and 6). Ca and Mg accumulated  preferentially in leaves, compare to stems and roots, in both cultivars. In  RM, Ca and Mg in the leaves exhibited a maximum trend with the  highest concentration under 15− 30 mg L− 1 P supply, and the same trend  was apparent also for Ca in DQ. In both varieties, Ca concentration in the  roots increased with the increase in P supply, while Mg concentration  displayed a maximum trend (Figs. 5D-E, 6 D-E).  
In order to estimate whether the influence of P on mineral accu mulation in the plant tissues was governed by translocation, uptake or  an interaction of the two processes, the bioaccumulation coefficient (BC)  and the translocation factor (TF) were calculated (Figs. 7 and 8). Bio accumulation and translocation of more nutrients were affected by P  nutrition in RM then in DQ. With the increase in P supply, the uptake of  N and K increased in RM, Ca and Mg uptake increased and P uptake  decreased in both cultivars (Fig. 7). In both cultivars, the translocation  of P and Ca decreased with the increase in P supply, Mg translocation  increased and K translocation was unaffected, while N translocation  increased only in RM (Fig. 8).  
3.4. Micronutrients concentration  
Interaction between P supply and micronutrient uptake is docu mented and has been researched for years. In this study, we identified  differences in accumulation of micronutrients between plant organs, as

well as effects of P nutrition on micronutrient accumulation. All tested  micronutrients (Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu) accumulated to highest concentration in  the roots, and the order of concentrations in the plant organs was usually  roots > leaves > stems, except for Zn and Mn in one of the cultivars (DQ)  that had similar concentrations in the leaves and stem (Figs. 5 and 6).  
In both cultivars, Zn concentration in the root was higher at the  lowest P input (5 mg L− 1 P) compared with all other treatments, how ever concentrations in the stem and the leaves were not affected (in DQ)  and only marginally affected (in RM) by P supply (Figs. 5G, 6 G). Unlike  uptake into the plant, which wasn’t affected by P supply (Fig. 7), root-to shoot translocation of Zn was lower under low P and retention in roots  was observed (Fig. 8).  
Manganese concentration in the shoot organs had a similar respond  trend to P supply for both cultivars, which differed from the root  response. Leaves’ Mn concentration presented a maximum curve, with  highest accumulation at 15 and 30 mg L− 1 P in RM and DQ, respectively.  In the stem, Mn concentration declined with P supply. In the roots, in  RM the highest accumulation of Mn occurred under high P supply (60,  90 mg L− 1), while in DQ the highest Mn concentration was apparent  under P scarcity, in the 5 mg L− 1 treatment (Figs. 5H, 6 H). P nutrition  influenced Mn translocation only in RM and uptake was not affected in  both cultivars (Figs. 7 and 8).  
Fe concentration in the roots presented a minimum curve, with the  lowest concentration under 60 and 15 mg L− 1 P supply in RM and DQ,  respectively (Figs. 5F, 6 F). Leaves’ and stems’ concentrations were

generally not affected by P input, except in RM leaves, that similar to the  roots exhibited highest accumulation under low P supply. Fe uptake in  RM was higher under P deficiency (Fig. 7). Cu concentration in leaves,  stem and root averaged 0.006, 0.004, 0.011 mg/kg, respectively (data is  not presented). Overall, bioaccumulation of the tested micronutrients,  beside Fe in RM, was not affected by P supply (Fig. 7). Influence on  translocation was only found in Zn in both cultivars and Mn in RM  (Fig. 8).  
3.5. Plant visual characteristics  
The P treatments affected similarly the visual appearance of the  plants from both cultivars (Fig. 9), reflecting the identified effects on  morphological, chemical and physiological characteristics. In the 5 mg  L− 1 P treatment, deficiency symptoms were clearly apparent in both  varieties (Fig. 9). Plants that grew under this P regime were smaller,  shorter, with fewer and smaller leaves. Older leaves of this treatment  were chlorotic and younger leaves had a pale green color. The leaves in  general looked wilted, especially for DQ. 15− 90 mg L− 1 P treatments  resulted in an absence of visible symptoms.  
4. Discussion  
The aim of the current study was to analyze functional-physiology  response of medicinal cannabis plants to P nutrition. Phosphorus is  required in relatively large amount in plants, but in the medicinal  cannabis industry it is conventionally supplied at higher amounts than is  customary for most other crops. This is due to the belief that cannabis  plants require high concentrations of P for optimal function and  increased yield. Mineral nutrition has a considerable impact on plant  morpho-development. The effect may differ between the vegetative and  reproductive stages of plant development and between genotypes  (Clark, ´ 1983). Development of optimal cultivation schemes require  understanding of the plant functional response to mineral nutrients for  their adjustment to the various developmental stages. The cultivars used  in the study suffered from P deficiency under the lowest P application  tested, i.e., 5 mg L− 1 P, which affected plant physiological function,  morphological development and biomass accumulation. The plants’  development was not negatively affected by excess P supply. The only  identified response to excess supply was in the gas exchange parameters,  demonstrating reduced photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal  conductance under P excess.  
4.1. Plant development and function  
Biomass accumulation and plant morphological development were  not significantly affected by concentrations higher than 30 mg L− 1;  response to lower concentrations varied between cultivars and tissues  (Fig. 1). Maximum dry weight was reached under 15 and 30 mg L− 1 P  application in RM and DQ plants, respectively (Fig. 1A-B). Reduction in  shoot biomass under P deficiency is well documented (Fredeen et al.,  1989; Smith et al., 1990; Shane et al., 2004), and in accord with our  results, sensitivity to P scarcity was reported before to vary between  genotypes (Balemi and Schenk, 2009a,b).  
Under P deficiency decrease in root and shoot biomass is common.  Shoot grows is usually more inhibited compared to root growth, resulted  in a decline in shoot/root ratio as a response to P starvation (Hawkesford  et al., 2012). Our results demonstrate a decrease in root and shoot  biomass with no effect on shoot/root ratio (Data is not shown) and in  contrast to the response of the C. sativa genotypes, studies in legumes  demonstrated an increase in root biomass percentage under P shortage  (Fredeen et al., 1989; Smith et al., 1990) probably reflecting an adaptive  trait to increase P uptake potential. The varied responses to P-depriva tion can reflect diverse P requirements and/or adaptive responses of  distinctive species and cultivars.  
P supplement above the optimal requirement did not support a  further increase in plant biomass. This result is similar to prior studies on  hemp (Vera et al., 2010) and support our finding of a wide optimum  range for P in medical cannabis. Indication of P toxicity was not found  and is very rare in plants due to root down regulation of Pi transporters  (Dong et al., 1999). In this study, plants that received the 5 mg L− 1 P  treatment were shorter with a smaller stem diameter and less nodes  (Fig. 2A–F), and the plant morphology was similar for all treatments  higher than 5 mg L− 1 in both cultivars. This is in contrast to our previous  study (Bernstein et al., 2019b) that showed a decrease in plant height as  
6

a result of P addition. The varied response may reflect differences in the  basic composition of the growing media, P source, or genotypic  differences.  
Severe nutrient limitations can cause a visual response in the plants.  Diagnosis of nutrients deficiency and toxicity is often initially based on  visual observation of the plant, although it is a qualitative rather than a  quantitate test. By the time visual symptoms of deficiency or toxicity  appear, plant health and productivity may already be substantially  compromised, and corrective actions may not be fully affective.  Different species and cultivars may differ in response, and variability in  sensitivity between individual plants complicates visual diagnostics  (Wong, 2005; McCauley et al., 2011). Phosphorus is an essential plant  element that is required in large quantities, therefore insufficient P  levels are common. P toxicity symptoms are less common because of the  ability of many plant species to regulate P uptake. Symptoms of P  deficiency usually include reduction of leaf expansion and number of  leaves (Hawkesford et al., 2012). The two cannabis cultivars analyzed in

the current study responded similarly to P scarcity, and the imposed  morphological constrains were in accord with known responses for other  crops. Specifically reduced, leaf area, shoot growth and leaf formation  were induced at an early stage of the deficiency (Fig. 9).  
Physiological traits demonstrated as well sensitivity to P nutrition in  medical cannabis. Gas exchange parameters in the cannabis leaves were  significantly influenced by P nutrition. Photosynthesis rate, stomatal  conductance, transpiration rate and intercellular CO2 levels increased  with P inputs up to a maximum level under 30 mg L− 1 supply in both  cultivars (Fig. 3), demonstrating a P-deficiency induced growth re 
striction under supply of 5 mg L− 1 P (Fig. 1A-B). A similar increase in gas  exchange, by P supplementation was reported for spinach (Brooks,  1986), soybean (Fredeen et al., 1989; Taliman et al., 2019), potato  (Fleisher et al., 2012), wheat (Arshad et al., 2016), cotton (Wang et al.,  2018) and cowpea (Vanies et al., 2018). Unlike studies that showed  amplified photosynthesis and stomatal conductance with unchanged  intercellular CO2 concentration as a response to P addition (brooks,

S. Shiponi and N. Bernstein 
1986; Wong, 2005; Neocleous and Savvas, 2019), in the current study  intercellular CO2 increased, in accord with the stomatal conductance  response curve. Brooks (1986, 1988) suggested that P shortage affects  photosynthesis by a stomatal and nonstomatal mechanisms. Non 
stomatal limitation was explained by an influence of P supply on the  level of RuBisCo carboxylase activation and decreased regeneration of  ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, as a product of a regulatory role over en zymes in the Calvin cycle. In the current study, stomatal limitation was  possibly a major influence on photosynthesis rate because of the effect of  the P treatment on the intercellular CO2 rates. A nonstomatal influence  could be involved and requires further study. Leaf photosynthesis, sto matal conductance, intercellular CO2 and transpiration rates declined  with P addition above 30 mg L− 1 in both cultivars. Decrease in gas ex change parameters as a result of P toxicity has been observed before by  Shane et al. (2004). Although gas exchange parameters decreased with  the increase in P concentration, no effect has been observed on the  plant’s dry weight, however, higher P concentration or a longer growing  period might achieve stronger development inhibition.

The concentrations of the photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll a  and b, decreased under P deficiency in RM (Fig. 4A-B). Similar results  were found in barley (Frydenvang et al., 2015) corn, (Soltangheisi et al.,  2013) and soybeans (Lauer et al., 1989). However, corresponding to the  results we obtained for DQ, chlorophyll concentration is known to be  unaffected or rise under P limitation (Tombesi et al., 1969; Terry and  Ulrich, 1973; Brooks, 1986, 1988; Rao and Terry, 1989; Neocleous and  Savvas, 2019). Our results reflect that the effect of P on chlorophyll  concentration can vary not just between species, but also between cul tivars. The reduction in chlorophyll concentration can be linked to the  reduction of N in leaves in the low P treatments as an indirect effect of P  on chlorophyll production (Kerwin et al., 2017; Saloner et al., 2019). It  was suggested that the inhibition of photosynthesis under low P results  from effects on the photosynthesis reaction site rather than on stomatal  conductivity or chlorophyll content (Neocleous and Savvas, 2019). The  results of the current study suggest that the altered photosynthesis rate is  related to chlorophyll content in the leaves and stomatal conductivity.

4.2. Interplay between P nutrition and the cannabis plant ionome  
The increase in the plant tissue’s P concentration, reflects a stimu lation of P uptake upon exposure of the plants to an increase in P con centration in the nutrient solution. Most of the plant P accumulated in  the roots, and only a small portion was translocated to the shoot. The  small increase in P concentration in the leaves and stem of RM plants  and the lack of change in DQ, demonstrate a defense mechanism against  P toxicity in the shoot (Hawkesford et al., 2012), preventing shoot  cellular exposure to damaging concentrations. Compartmentation of P  under excessive P supply was found to be a key mechanism for pre venting accumulation of toxic levels of cyt-Pi. Under adequate P nutri tion, around 70–95 % of the intercellular Pi is stored in the vacuole.  Thus, transporter regulation under varying P conditions enables main taining the Pi cellular homeostasis (Liu et al., 2016).  
Beside N, P and Ca, concentrations of all other nutrients in leaves at  the optimal P range were similar to the range described as satisfactory  for plant growth in hemp. N and P concentrations were lower than the  recommended levels for hemp, and Ca concentration was slightly higher  (Iv´anyi and Izsaki, ´ 2009). The similarity between the sufficient leaf  concentrations in hemp and in medical cannabis is not unexpected  because they are genetically similar. Though, it is surprising because of  the different growth morphology, vigor and uses they were breed for.  The reason for the deviation of the concentrations of N, P and Ca from  the documented satisfactory concentrations for hemp, may result also  from difference in the tissue selected for analysis. In the hemp experi ment the leaf analyzed was the youngest mature leaf on the plant. Due to  the restricted in planta mobility of Ca in the phloem, and the high  translocation of N and P in both the xylem and the phloem (Iwahashi  et al., 2012; White, 2012b), lower concentrations of Ca and higher

concentrations of N and P then the shoot leaf average that was analyzed  in the current study is indeed expected.  
Phosphorus nutrition had a considerable effect on Mg uptake into the  plants, and translocation to the shoot (Figs. 7 and 8). Mg uptake was  lower under P deficiency in both cultivars as is evident by the lower  Bioaccumulation factor. The increase in the Translocation Factor with  the increase in P supply establish that Mg translocation to the shoot was  also compromised under low P and was enhanced by P supplement. This  is demonstrated in both cultivars by the increase in Mg concentration in  leaves and roots up to 30 mg L− 1 P and the concomitant decrease in root Mg only above this concentration (Figs. 5 and 6). In RM, stem-Mg  increased up to 15− 30 mg L− 1 P without a decline above 30 mg L− 1  P. DQ stem-Mg wasn’t affected by P, despite the change in the leaves and  
the root. The response curve of Ca concentration in leaves and stem to P  supply presented a similar trend to Mg, with a significant increase from 5  to 15 mg L− 1 P supply but a decrease in both cultivar with P addition  above 30 mg L− 1. Unlike the maximum response trend in the shoot  tissues, root Ca concentration increased with the increase in P supply  throughout the P concentration tested. This demonstrates restriction of  root-to-shoot transport of Ca under high P supply, which results in root localization as can be seen by the decrease in the Translocation Factor  (Fig. 8). Influence of P on Mg and Ca uptake and translocation, and Ca  and Mg deficiency under low P availability is documented for several  plant species (Reneau et al., 1983; Skinner and Matthews, 1990; Rein 
bott and Blevins, 1991, 1994). Reduced competition with K was sug gested as a mechanism for P influence on Mg and Ca translocation

(Reneau et al., 1983). Our results show that such indirect P influence on  Ca and Mg through K is unlikely in the current study, due to the het erogeneous effect of the P treatments on K concentration in the plant  organs between the varieties, unlike the results for Ca and Mg that  presented similar trends for both cultivars. Because of the increase in K  uptake into the plant in RM with the increase in P supply (Fig. 7), an  enhanced Mg application as a substitute for K for maintaining  cation-anion balance is also excluded. Lower pH in the rhizosphere of P  deficient plants can limit cation uptake because of H+ binding to the  cation exchange sites and a resulting decrease in the effective cation  exchange capacity (White, 2012a). Thus, root acidification may involve  in the reduced Ca, Mg and K concentration. The leachate solution from  the pots was sampled regularly and the pH was steady over time, at the  range of 6.0–6.5, with no significant differences between treatments.  However, the spatial gradient of acidification in the root rhizosphere can  change dramatically within mm from the root surface and the reduced  cation uptake may be caused by local acidification due to low P supply  (Nye, 1981; Hinsinger et al., 2003).  
In the current study, we identified that uptake of K and N into the  plants (Fig. 7) and their concentrations in the plant (Figs. 5 and 6) varied  between the cannabis varieties studied, demonstrating a genetic vari ability. RM’s 5 and 15 mg L− 1 P treatments had lower N concentration in  
the leaves than the identified concentration under optimal N-nutrition  by a previous study from our lab on medicinal cannabis (Saloner and  Bernstein, 2020). The decrease in N concentration under low P supply in  the medical cannabis plants, likely contributed to the growth restriction  under P-deficiency (i.e., reduced plant hight, and restricted biomass  accumulation: Fig. 1) (Hawkesford et al., 2012; Aubin et al., 2015).  Numerous previous studies documented genotypic variability in uptake  and distribution of mineral elements in plants. Differences in N accu 
mulation and distribution between genotypes were found in wheat,  sorghum and maize (Clark, ´ 1983). Potassium uptake and allocation, and  K use efficiency varied between varieties in barley, bean, soybean and  tomato (Clark, ´ 1983). Unlike the bioaccumulation factor, the trans 
location factor value for K in RM was not affected by the P treatments,  implying that the P treatments effected K uptake into the plants in RM,  but not root-shoot translocation (Figs. 7 and 8). We believe that the  observed chlorosis of older leaves under P deficiency can be an indirect  response to low N in the shoot. The data presented here demonstrate an  interplay between P and other macronutrients uptake into the plant,  in-planta translocation and accumulation, and variability between  cultivars.  
As we have demonstrated here for P (Fig. 5B), and previously also for  K (Saloner et al., 2019) and N (Saloner and Bernstein, 2020) uptake of  
11

nutrients into cannabis plants is affected by their concentration in the  root medium. It should therefore be considered that tissue concentra tions of other nutrients in cannabis could diverge from our reported  values under different supply rates.  
Micronutrients have a tremendous effect on plant growth and  physiology (Broadley et al., 2012). Thus, understanding the effect of P  on microelements’ nutrition can help understand the plant response to P  supply even when symptoms of deficiency or toxicity aren’t visibly  apparent. Our results revealed significant effects of P supply on micro 
nutrient concentrations in the plant organs of both medical cannabis  genotypes.  
Zn root’s concentration increased under P deficiency in both culti vars but decreased in RM’s leaves and stem. Supply of P above the  threshold optimum concentration for plant development (30 mg L− 1 P;  Figs. 5 and 6) didn’t alter Zn concentration in the root but decreased Zn  concentration in RM’s stems and leaves. P interaction with other  microelement, and particularly with Zn, was reported for numerous  plants (Safaya, 1976; Haldar and Mandal, 1981; Parker et al., 1992;  Khan et al., 2014; Prasad et al., 2016) and commonly referred to as “P  induced Zn deficiency” (Loneragan et al., 1982; Cakmak and Marschner,  1986).  
Plants developed homeostasis mechanisms for Zn and P. Over accumulation of P in a response to Zn starvation was found to result from  a specific induction of the activity and expression of P transporter in  A. thaliana (Gupta et al., 2016) and barley (Huang et al., 2000). Phos phorus deficiency was found to repress genes induced by Zn deficiency  in A. thaliana (Van De Mortel et al., 2006; Khan et al., 2014). The  antagonistic effect of P on Zn is mostly believed to occur within the plant  in the form of dilution effect due to P promotion of leaf area and regu lation of translocation from root to shoot (Youngdahl et al., 1977; Sol tangheisi et al., 2013). Our results partially match previous reports for  P-Zn negative interaction (Loneragan et al., 1982; Cakmak and  Marschner, 1986; Khan et al., 2014; Prasad et al., 2016) and demon strate a decrease in Zn concentration with increased P supply only in  roots. However, in the shoot organs, a maximum curve is apparent and  the negative effect of P on Zn concentrations is visible only above 30 mg  L− 1 P in RM. The retention of Zn in roots under P deficiency was also  found by Loneragan et al. (1982) in okra and is in contrast to the results  found by Cakmak and Marschner (1986) and Singh et al. (1988) in  which an increase in root was found under high P level. Zn deficiency in  the shoot under high P supply was explained by a possible increase in Zn  binding to the root cell wall and by the formation of Zn-phytate (Sol tangheisi et al., 2013). This explanation is less likely to be applicable to  our results with C. sativa that demonstrate Zn accumulate in roots under  low P, rather than high P concentration. The data presented here show a  small influence of high P nutrition on Zn concentration in the plant, yet  the effect on root-to-shoot translocation and on the accumulation in the  root under P starvation is significant (Figs. 5, 6 and 8). Zn uptake into  the plants was not affected by P supply in both cultivars (Fig. 7).  
Mn concentration in the leaves presented a maximum concentration  response trend to P supply, with the highest concentrations at 15 mg L− 1  for RM and 30 mg L− 1 in DQ (Figs. 5 and 6). Mn accumulated in root to  highest concentrations under 5 and 60 mg L− 1 P in DQ and RM,  respectively, demonstrating a genetic variability. Root to shoot trans location of Mn was significantly affected by P supply only in RM (Fig. 8).  [The observed changes were not significantly different in DQ]. However,  DQ translocation in the plant was also altered as is visible from the in 
crease in stem and root concentration in spite of the concomitant  decrease in leaves’ concentration under P deficiency (Fig. 6). The in fluence on leaves Mn’s accumulation was masked in the translocation  factor results by the increase in stem Mn concentration. Corresponding  with the Mn results, Fe concentrations in the roots also varied between  the 2 cultivars, with minimum accumulation under 60 and 15 mg L− 1 in  RM and DQ, respectively.  
Taken together, these results suggest that P has a higher effect on the  translocation of the microelements from the root to the shoot than on  
root uptake (Figs. 7 and 8).  
Industrial hemp plants are well known as heavy metal accumulators  and are therefore considered potential plants for bio-remediation  (Ahmad et al., 2016). Furthermore, fibers and seeds of hemp are  capable of sorbing heavy metal in large quantities, and are therefore  being tested for the use as bioabsorbents and for the safety of the seed-oil  extracts (Linger et al., 2002; Pejic et al., 2009; Mihoc et al., 2012; Ahmad  et al., 2015). Unlike its hemp relative, our results for the ‘drug-type’  medical cannabis, present low accumulation of metal ion in the plants as  is supported also by a previous report by Saloner et al. (2019). The  difference in metal uptake characteristics between hemp and the me dicinal cannabis cultivars can source from genetic variability in accu 
mulation potential, chemical properties of the cultivation media (soilless  culture vs. soil) or the different stage of growth studied (vegetative vs.  reproductive). This issue is currently under investigation in our  laboratory.  
In summary, our results demonstrate a wide optimum range for P  nutrition in medicinal cannabis, at the vegetative growth phase.  Although visual symptoms of deficiency and toxicity were not apparent  under the supply range of 15–90 mg L− 1 P, integration with the gas  exchange results bring us to the conclusion that 30 mg L− 1 P supply is  optimal for plant function. Uptake of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and root to  shoot translocation of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn and Mn were affected by P  supply.
