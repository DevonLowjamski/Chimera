ABSTRACT 
In 2019, an air emissions field sampling study was conducted by the Colorado Department of  Public Health and Environment’s Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) at four commercial cannabis  cultivation facilities. Measurements of ambient biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOC) con centrations were collected from various growing stages of cannabis (vegetative and flowering) and  during post-harvest activities (drying and trimming). These data were then used to determine  room-specific biogenic VOC emission rates for three of the facilities from the vegetative stage of  the life cycle through post-harvest activities. This study shows that the magnitude of biogenic VOC  emissions within a cannabis cultivation facility varies widely with the highest emission rates of up  to 7.18E–1 kg/hr found during mechanical trimming and up to 2.33E–1 kg/hr in the drying rooms.  These were up to an order of magnitude higher than emission rates found in the cultivation rooms.  For example, Facility A vegetative room had an emissions rate of 1.46E–2 kg/hr. Normalized by the  amount of biomass present, the drying rooms had the highest VOC emissions rates, with  a maximum rate of 1.6E–3 kg/hr/kg biomass. The flowering room rates were found to be up to  3.25E–4 kg/hr/kg biomass and drying rooms up to 1.16E–3 kg/hr/kg biomass. When normalized by  plant count, emission rates in the flower rooms ranged from 8.11E–6 to 3.62E–4 kg/hr/plant. The  dominant monoterpenes from sampling were β-myrcene, terpinolene, and D-limonene. These data  suggest that the variability in emission rates across cannabis production will create a challenge in  establishing a generalized emission factor for all facilities. Across the industry, cannabis cultivation  conditions and strategies can vary widely impacting the amount and type of VOC emissions.  Minimizing uncertainties for VOC emission from cannabis facilities requires site-specific informa tion on air exchange rates, plant counts, cannabis strains, biomass, and if hand or mechanical  processing is used. 
Implications: This study found that the magnitude of biogenic VOC emissions within a cannabis  cultivation varies widely throughout rooms found in the facility, with the highest emissions found  during post-harvest activities (i.e. trimming) and the lowest rates in the vegetative room. These  data suggest that the large emission sources of VOCs are found post-harvest and emission  inventories based solely on cultivation emissions will underestimate total biogenic VOC emissions  from indoor cannabis cultivation facilities. The dominant measured terpenes throughout all facil ities from cultivation to post harvest were: β-myrcene, terpinolene, and D-limonene.

Introduction 
Colorado legalized the medical and recreational use of  cannabis in 2000 and 2012, respectively. Since Colorado  began implementing cannabis licensing, the cannabis  industry has grown rapidly. In Colorado, large-scale  commercial cannabis cultivation occurs primarily  indoors, allowing for greater compliance and process  control along with optimizing crop-yield and  permitting year-round harvesting. Due to the infra structure requirements of these indoor cultivation facil 
ities, and zoning restrictions, most of these cannabis  
cultivation and cannabis infused product manufactur ing facilities are located in dense urban and industrial  areas within retrofitted warehouses, according to the  
Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division. As cannabis plants grow, they naturally emit biogenic  volatile organic compounds (VOC), primarily as mono terpenes, with species found in many other plants and  trees (Fischedick et al. 2010; Fuentes et al. 2000;  Marchini et al. 2014; Ross and ElSohly 1996;  Samburova et al. 2019; Sharkey, Wiberley, and  Donohue 2008; Turner et al. 1979; Urso et al. 2022;  Wang et al. 2019a). VOCs are an important precursor

for ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM) and could  raise concerns related to worker safety when exposed to  high concentrations indoors. This could be important  for indoor settings, where concentrations can be many  times higher than outdoor settings. Understanding the  potential air quality impacts of cannabis cultivation is  complicated by a lack of understanding about the types  and magnitude of VOCs emitted from cannabis along  with the correlation with light and temperature. Each  strain of cannabis has unique biochemical processes in  its metabolism that results in a unique composition of  terpenes (Fischedick et al. 2010). Studies that have  examined the emissions profile of terpenes in the can nabis bud and cannabis-derived oils find a high concen tration of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and  cannabinoids, with monoterpenes typically dominating  the terpene profile (Fischedick et al. 2010; Marchini  et al. 2014; Ross and ElSohly 1996; Samburova et al.  2019; Turner et al. 1979; Urso et al. 2022). A study  estimated the basal emission rate (BER) of VOCs from  four strains of cannabis in an enclosure experiment with  a limited number of plants (not representative of  a commercial cultivation) and found a range of 4.3 to  8.6 µg C g−1 hr−1 BERs between different strains of  cannabis and that the emissions are dependent on envir onmental conditions (Wang et al. 2019a). These data  suggest emission profiles from cannabis cultivation  could vary widely across facilities due to cultivation  strategies, the cannabis strains grown, and the type of  indoor environmental control methodologies that are  applied. These factors present a challenge in efforts to  develop industry-wide emission inventories. 
Plants at indoor cannabis facilities are generally cul tivated within 2–5 months, with three primary stages of  plant growth (clone, vegetative, and flowering) that are  segregated into different rooms of varying light and  environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and  humidity) to optimize plant growth. Due to the high  intensity lighting and plant transpiration, cultivation  facilities have high the heating, ventilation, and air con ditioning (HVAC) loads to remove heat and moisture. It  is important to note that one of the biggest advantages  of indoor cultivation is the full plant life cycle is con densed from 4 to 7 months when grown outside down  to 2–5 months of cultivation inside a building. This  means the VOC emissions rate could potentially be  higher for indoor plants compared to outdoor grown  plants due to the condensed life cycle. 
Given the limited number of observed emission factor  data, and the large variety of strains of cannabis, there still  exists large uncertainties for VOC emission inventories for  cannabis cultivation. These cultivation emissions, however,  only represent part of the total potential emissions from  
activities in a facility. After the plants have fully developed  flowers, they are harvested, dried, and processed. In the  harvesting process, excess stalks, stems, and fan leaves are  cut and discarded and the flowers and sugar leaves are  dried in separate areas in a controlled process before the  sellable flowers are trimmed, cured, and packaged. The  trimming process can vary and can be multi-stage from  hand-trimming to utilizing high-speed mechanical trim ming to remove the excess leaves off the flowers before  sale. The excess plant material and some flowers typically  go to an extraction process to make various cannabis  products (e.g., concentrates, edibles, and topicals). Some  extraction processes utilize VOC-based solvents like pro pane, butane, and ethanol in closed-loop systems  (Samburova et al. 2019; Valizadehderakhshan et al. 2021).  In addition to solvent VOCs, there could be wound 
compound (pentene and hexane alcohols and aldehydes)  VOC emissions from the harvesting, trimming and drying  procedures which also add to the total VOC profile.  (Ameye et al. 2018) After the flowers are trimmed for  sale, they are dried and cured. Curing is an additional  drying and aging stage where the flowers are sealed for  various amounts of time before they are vented in  a repeating process to slowly dry the flowers before packa ging and sale; this process is similar to aging cheese. 
Quantifying VOC emissions from commercial indoor  cannabis cultivation facilities is critical to predict the  impact on air quality (Samburova et al. 2019; Urso et al.  2022; Wang et al. 2019b). Further, specifically for indoor  facilities, the VOC emissions from the plant cultivation  process could have implications on worker health for  individuals who work in the facility, but more research is  needed. There is, however, a data gap on emission rates  from post-harvest activities meaning that any quantifica tion of cultivation facility emissions must include all emis 
sions from seed to sale to reduce uncertainties. The  following describes a collaborative field study with the  cannabis cultivation industry and Colorado Department  of Public Health and Environment’s (CDPHE) Air  Pollution Control Division (APCD) to quantitatively esti 
mate biogenic VOC emissions rates and speciation profiles  for various stages of plant growth and during post-harvest  activities within commercial indoor cannabis cultivation  facilities. All study-related data is included within the tables  (in manuscript and supplemental documents) besides the  PID data are available on request from CDPHE as it is in  multiple very large files. 
Methods 
CDPHE APCD’s staff conducted sample collection at  four indoor cannabis cultivation facilities in Colorado,  laboratory analysis of samples was conducted by Desert  
Research Institute (DRI), and indoor air quality model ing was conducted by the University of North  Carolina – Chapel Hill. The laboratory analyses for  samples were limited to biogenic terpenes and did not  include measurements of solvent emissions. 
Cultivation facility selection and details 
In 2019, there were 1,167 licensed cannabis cultivation  facilities in Colorado according to the Colorado  Department of Revenue’s Marijuana Enforcement  Division. Study participation was elicited by reaching  out to cannabis industry stakeholders about the study  and doing preliminary site evaluations at interested  cultivation facilities to select representative facilities to  sample. Facility selection criteria included diversity in  strains grown, facility size, and location. As shown in  Table 1, four cultivation facilities volunteered to anon ymously participate in this study: two large (>100,000  harvested plants per year) facilities (Facility A and B),  one medium (Facility D) (>20,000 harvested plants  per year), and one small (Facility C) (<1,000 harvested  plants per year). 
Facility A has an infrastructure that was explicitly  designed for precise climate-controlled cannabis culti vation with two main exhaust points (north and  south). There are currently 64 carbon filters in the  north exhaust and 48 carbon filters in the south  exhaust, for a total of 112 carbon filters at Facility  A. The filters are changed when cannabis odor is  detected at the perimeter of the parking lot which is  monitored on a bi-weekly basis. Exhaust filtration  reduces the likelihood that a significant fraction of  released VOCs are recycled back to into the building  through HVAC intakes. 
Facility B has 60 20-ton rooftop HVAC units that  recirculate recycled-air within the facility and only one  dedicated exhaust point for air to leave the building that  is located on the side of the building away from the  rooftop HVAC units. This single exhaust point and  other recirculation points do not have any installed

filtration but are in different locations so mixing of  inlet and exhaust is minimized. 
Facility C has a unique HVAC system that utilizes  a “lung room.” Intake air is pulled from the lung room  and exhaust air is pumped into the lung room, creating  a challenge for air sampling. Unfortunately, it was not  possible to calculate any emission rates or an air  exchange rate for Facility C due to the complex HVAC  system causing unpredictable mixing of inlet, ambient,  and exhaust air. 
Facility D has a combination of evaporative cooling  and traditional rooftop HVAC units. Additionally  Facility D has at least two exhaust points per room  with plant activity (growing, flowering/harvesting, dry 
ing/curing) that maintain negative pressure within the  facility. Each exhaust port is equipped with a carbon  filter that is changed annually. Exhaust filtration reduces  the likelihood that a significant fraction of released  VOCs are recycled back to into the building through  HVAC intakes. Based on our evaluation of HVAC sys 
tems in facilities A, B, and D, we assume a clean back ground for calculations. 
Supplementary Table S1 in the supplemental docu ments lists the cannabis strain types grown at each  facility by the percent of the total number of plants  harvested in 2019. Note that in supplementary Table  S1, strains that individually represent less than 1% of  the total harvest are grouped together at the bottom of  each column to condense reporting to the more signifi cant strains grown. Supplementary Table S2 and sup plementary Table S3 in the supplemental documents  show the plant count and strain type for the flowering  rooms and weight of product by strain types in the  drying room for facilities A, B, and D on the day of  sample collection.

polymer adsorbent (Tenax TA) filled glass tubes at  a constant flow rate of approximately 25–40 ml/min  for durations ranging from 5 to 20 minutes per sample,  based on the expected concentrations determined from  preliminary photoionization detector (PID) monitor 
ing. Indoor samples were collected in areas that were  generally the middle of the rooms, at points that were  considered to be well mixed from the various ventilation  points. Duplicate (parallel) tube samples were also taken  at each facility, to compare parallel sample results to  ensure accuracy in laboratory analysis. To collect the  duplicate samples, a second identical tube sampling  setup was added with the two tube inlets placed as  close as possible to one another during the sampling.  The pumps were operated in identical manners for the  same amount of time to ensure comparability of the  samples. After sampling, all tubes were immediately  sealed with brass end-caps and placed on ice for storage,  then overnight cold-pack shipped to DRI in Reno, NV  for analysis. Laboratory blanks were run to determine  any bias from the analytical processes. No blank car tridge samples were taken during the indoor study in an  effort to efficiently make use of the small number of  samples we had the budget to collect. The uncertainties  in the instruments used for the study are listed in sup plementary Table S4 of the supplemental documents. 
Two ppbRAE 3000 PID units calibrated to 10 ppm  isobutylene and set to a flow rate of 400 ml/min were  used to monitor total VOC concentrations for about  a week at each sample collection point at each facility  to determine an optimal sampling time for subsequent  Tenax tube sample collection. Periods of maximum and  minimum concentrations were targeted for sampling,  within the operating hours of the volunteering facilities  for sampling access. PID sampling details are in supple mentary Table S5 of the supplemental documents. PID  data are available on request from CDPHE as the data  files are very large. 
As an example of how CDPHE used the PID data to  determine tube sampling times representative of mini mum and maximum concentrations, Figure 1 shows the  1-s interval PID concentrations in ppb that were mon itored within the Facility B drying room for an 8-day  period from 7/25/19 to 8/1/19. The Facility put a fresh  batch of cannabis in the drying room the day the PID  monitoring started and the downward trend in Figure 1  represents the overall concentration dropping as the  cannabis dries out. The intermittent concentration  spikes during staff operating hours are from the curing  operation of venting air out of sealed containers of aging  cannabis stored within the drying room, releasing addi tional terpenes within the drying room. The graph

shows the VOC concentrations are influenced by staff  operations but do not drop completely outside of oper ating hours in the evenings and over the weekend as the  cannabis continues to dry in the room. After evaluating  the data in Figure 1, the Facility B Tenax tube samples  were collected in the drying room on Wednesday 8/14/  2019 in the morning to represent a low VOC concen tration and then in the afternoon after fresh batch of  cannabis was loaded into the drying room to represent  a high VOC concentration. Note that sample collection  times were restricted to facility operating hours for  security purposes. The average total VOC concentration  from the Tenax tube sample collected in the Facility  B drying room was 4.59E +03 µg/m3. 
This sampling methodology was applied to analyzing  all the PID data at the various sampling locations to  determine optimal tube sample collection times that  represent low and high VOC concentrations at each  location within the constraints of sampling within oper 
ating hours. For example, only one sample was collected  in a vegetative room at Facility A after the PID Data  showed consistently low VOC concentrations, compar able with the findings in other cannabis cultivation  emissions studies (Samburova et al. 2019; Wang et al.  2019a). With the vegetative room being a low contribu tor to the overall cannabis cultivation emissions profile  the limited tube sampling budget was utilized to capture  the larger VOC emissions contributors like the flower ing, drying and trimming rooms.

Figure 1; from 7/25/19 to 8/1/19. The graph shows the  VOC concentrations drop outside of operating hours in  the evenings and over the weekend when staff are not  actively trimming. In Figure 2 there are spikes in the  VOC concentrations on weekday afternoons, this is  when facility staff clean the trimming room with sol 
vent-based cleaner after the mechanical trimming is  done for the day. The tube sampling only captures  terpenes emissions, the focus of the study, and not  solvent emissions. The Facility B Tenax tube samples  were collected in the trimming room on Wednesday 8/  14/2019 in the morning to capture hand trimming  representative of a low VOC concentration and in the  afternoon during mechanical trimming to represent the  high VOC concentrations seen in Figure 2. The average  total VOC concentration from the Tenax tube sampling  in the Facility B trimming room was 3.14E +03 µg/m3. 
Tube sample collection times were based on the high  and low concentration times captured by the PID units as  discussed above. Tube samples were collected using con stant flow sampling pumps made by Markes  International and calibrated to an optimal sample flow  rate (informed by PID results) using a reference flow meter. Sampling times were limited to 5–15-min periods,  dependent upon the concentrations seen in the data  collected from the PIDs at the sampling points, to avoid  saturation and/or breakthrough of the Tenax media.  When room size and contents allowed, sample tubes  were placed in approximately the center of the room  being sampled, about halfway between the floor and the  ceiling in an effort to be at a well-mixed point in the  room based on the placement of exhaust vents, the entry/

exit points of the room, and maintaining a safe working  environment for the cannabis industry employees. Tube  sampling details and results are in supplementary Tables  S6 and S7, respectively, in the supplemental documents. 
Sample analysis methods 
After the Tenax tube samples were collected, they were  sealed, kept cold, and shipped overnight to the DRI  laboratory. At the DRI laboratory, biogenic VOCs (ter penes) were desorbed from the Tenax tubes using an  automated thermal desorber (TurboMatrix 650), fol lowed by gas chromatographic separation on Clarus  680 and analysis by mass spectrometry on Clarus SQ8  (all equipment by PerkinElmer, CT, USA). An Elite-5  MS (30 m × 0.25 mm I.D. × 0.25 μm) column  (PerkinElmer) was used in the gas chromatograph  (GC). The thermal desorber was operated such that  10% of the sample was transferred to the GC, while  the remaining part was collected on a clean Tenax  tube in case a reanalysis was required. VOCs were  identified by their retention time and mass spectra.  The target biogenic VOC compounds and sample  results are listed in supplementary Table S7 of the sup plemental documents. These target compounds were  quantified using calibration with analytical standards  [Restek Cannabis Terpenes standard (Restek Co.,  Bellefonte, PA)] that were transferred to Tenax tubes  that were subsequently desorbed and analyzed. The  average R2 value for calibration curves was 0.966 (the  median value was 0.995) and the calibration range was  20 ng to 1 μg. Minimum detection limits (MDL) were  measured by exposing pre-cleaned Tenax tubes to small  amounts of terpenes. MDLs for individual compounds  ranged between 0.6 and 1.8 ng per sample.  Reproducibility of the analysis results was assessed  using field-collected replicate samples, which on average  was 21% (median reproducibility was 7%). The Tenax  tube sampling data obtained from DRI was blank cor rected by taking the average concentration for each  compound in the blank samples and subtracting them  from the corresponding compound concentration  values reported by the laboratory. This correction did  not amount to significant changes in the concentrations  of the compounds detected. 
Emissions rate calculation 
Each room within each facility is modeled as  a completely mixed flow reactor at steady state.  A dynamic mass balance on BVOCs is therefore  given by:  
Fin  Fout ¼ R  ER þ L (1)  
where Fin is the mass flow rate into the room (kg/hr),  Fout is the mass flow rate out of the room (kg/hr), R is  the loss due to chemistry (kg/hr), ER is the emission rate  (kg/hr), and L is the loss due to dry deposition. 
Equation (1) is simplified by assuming that the rate  mass transport into the room, Fin, is zero (i.e., outdoor  concentrations are very low). For dry deposition, it was  assumed that VOCs would equilibrate rapidly with  room surfaces, i.e., that the rates of deposition to, and  re-emission from, indoor surfaces are equal and there 
fore would have a negligible impact on emission rates  (Won 2001). Thus, L was assumed to be zero. It is  important to note that this assumption of rapid equili brium is only valid if the facilities did not clean indoor  surfaces frequently. Considering these assumptions, the  mass balance simplifies to Equation (2).  
ER ¼ Fout þ R (2)  
The mass flowrate out of the building is given by the  measured biogenic VOC concentration, CBVOC (kg/m3),  times the air exchange rate, ë, (1/h) and building  volume, V (m3), both provided by the facility.  
Fout ¼ CBVOC � €e � V (3)  
For emission rates reported in the results, we assume the  biogenic VOC removal by reaction, R, is zero resulting  in Equation (6) 
ER ¼ CBVOC � €e � V (4)  
The uncertainty in the emission rate is dependent on the  uncertainty in the concentration values, air exchange  rate, and volume. The uncertainty and detection limits  for the concentration are described in the Sample  Analysis Section. 
The largest source of uncertainty is the air exchange  rate, ë, or ventilation rate, (ë × V). These were reported  by the facility but were not measured onsite. We discuss  the implications of that uncertainty in the results, noting  that we do not have a basis for estimating the magnitude  of the uncertainty in ventilation or air exchange rates for  all but one facility. The VOC signal, as measured by  PID, cannot be considered a conserved species for tracer  decay determination of air exchange rates (e.g. ASTM  method E741–11(2017)). VOCs adsorb and desorb from  surfaces, causing decay rates to change over time.  However, sharp VOC peaks due to facility cleaning in  the trimming room of Facility B rose well above back ground VOC levels and rapidly decayed in a way that  may be used to roughly estimate the air exchange rate.  Therefore, the PID results for Facility B during time  periods indicated by the arrows in Figure 2 were used  
to roughly estimate air change rates, recognizing that  these values are only approximations for comparison  with the facility reported values. 
Because chemistry may meaningfully reduce the  apparent emission rate, we evaluated this assumption  by estimating an upper bound on the losses due to  chemistry. To do this, it was assumed that BVOCs  react primarily with O3 and the hydroxyl radical, OH  as shown in Equation (6)  
R ¼ kOHCOHCBVOCV þ kO3CO3CBVOCV (5)  
where kOH and kO3 (m3 kg−1 s−1) are the second-order  rate constants for the reaction of OH and O3 with the  biogenic VOC, COH is the hydroxyl radical concentra tion, CO3 is the O3 concentration and V is the volume of  the room in which sampling occurred. 
Since OH can be generated by photolysis and by O3  chemistry inside the facility, it was assumed that  a steady OH concentration develops and can be esti mated from prior literature (Alvarez et al. 2013). The  term kOHCOH can be compared directly with the air  exchange rate to evaluate the relative importance of  this chemistry in reducing the concentrations of bio genic VOCs. We make this comparison with air  exchange for OH chemistry by assuming a high  indoor value for COH from prior literature (Alvarez  et al. 2013) and report the mass rate of chemical  removal by OH as shown Equation (6) (kOHCOH  CBVOCV). 
For O3, we use a different method to determine the  loss due to O3. The indoor O3 concentration may vary  from a maximum of that outdoors to zero, depending  on the air exchange rate and concentration of reactive  monoterpenes. The monoterpenes emitted by cannabis  plants are reactive with O3, and concentrations are high;  given enough residence time, much of the O3 that enters  the building could be titrated out by the monoterpenes  present (Weschler 2000). Rather than use the removal  rate method applied for OH, we estimate the upper bound removal rate of biogenic VOCs, by assuming  that all infiltrated O3 has been titrated by reaction with  monoterpenes. For a 1:1 stoichiometric reaction  between O3 and a monoterpene, the mass removal rate  is simply the infiltration rate of O3 from outside, multi plied by the appropriate molecular weight conversion as  shown in Equation (6)  
Rmax;O3 ¼ CO3;outdoor€eV �MWBVOC

where MWBVOC and MWO3 are the molecular weights of  a typical monoterpene (136 g/mol) and O3 (48 g/mol). Speciated monoterpene concentration sample results  from the Tenax Tube samples are listed in

supplementary Table S7 of the supplemental docu ments. As shown in supplementary Table S7, there  were 23 compounds that were identified across all facil ities and rooms. The highest VOC concentrations were  in the mechanical trimming room where β-myrcene  concentrations reached 2.31E4 μg/m3. In contrast, the  concentration of β-myrcene in the hand trimming  rooms was an order of magnitude lower. It is important  to note that the mechanical method is also able to trim  a larger volume of product when compared to hand  trimming. The drying room also had significant con centrations of β-myrcene reaching a maximum concen tration of 1.5E4 μg/m3 in Facility D. Only one vegetative  room sample was available and was from Facility A’s  vegetative room with the highest measured concentra tion, also being β-myrcene, at 4.8E2 μg/m3. The VOC  concentrations in the vegetative room are an order of  magnitude less than found in the other rooms in Facility  A and that is why only one vegetative room sample was  collected in this study with a limited sampling budget.  The rest of the Tenax tube sampling budget was focused  on capturing the rooms with higher emission rates (i.e.,  flower, drying, and trimming rooms). 
As shown in supplementary Table S7 of the supple mental documents, when averaged across all rooms and  facilities, β-myrcene had the largest concentration with  6.41E4 μg/m3 followed by terpinolene with 2.92E3 μg/  m3 and D-Limonene with 1.72E3 μg/m3. Table 2 pro vides the average measured concentration data for each  room across all facilities for the top five biogenic VOC  compounds. As shown in Table 2, β-myrcene was the  top measured compound in all rooms, with the highest  concentrations in the trimming rooms (average of  8.35E3 μg/m3). The top five biogenic VOC compounds  are consistent among the rooms, except for a lack of  terpinolene in all the trimming rooms and within the  Facility A vegetative room. This sampling study also  found notable amounts of ã-terpinene emissions from  the drying rooms in Facility C and Facility D but only  trace levels at Facility A and B, which is most likely  attributed to the unique strains grown at the facility.  Eucalyptol was relatively low in all samples collected in  this study. The similarity in dominant monoterpene  species across facilities is surprising given the large  variety of unique cannabis strains present in the flower  and drying rooms at each facility. Supplementary Table  S1 of the supplemental documents shows the number  and type of cannabis strains for each facility in 2019 and  supplementary Tables S2 and S3 in the supplemental  documents show the strains specifically in the flowering  and drying rooms during sampling. It is evident from  these supplementary tables that there are a large number  of reported cannabis strains where each facility has its

trimming is completed, which has a direct impact on  emission rates. For example, Facilities A and B utilize high speed mechanical trimmers that resulted in higher emis sions versus Facilities C and D that relied on hand trimming as shown in Table 3. Based on this facility specific data, a total biogenic VOC emission rate (kg/hr)  for each room was calculated and is shown in Table 3  (except for Facility C). The largest emission rate was  7.18E–1 kg/hr in the mechanical trimming room in  Facility A. In contrast, the biogenic VOC emission rates  in hand trimming rooms were an order of magnitude  smaller. The flower rooms also had significant emission  rates of up to 3.25E–1 kg/hr. 
Each of the four facilities sampled had different strains  of cannabis (supplementary Table S1), varied in the weight  of plants at harvest (Table 1), and the 2019 annual number  of plants grown by each facility (Table 1). Using these  average values, the emission rates in the flowering rooms  were normalized by biomass as shown in Table 3. Based on  these normalized values, Facility A’s flower room had the  highest rates of 3.14e-4 kg/hr per kg of biomass. It is  important to note that the emission rates varied by five  orders of magnitude suggesting that the large variety in  strains and varying growing strategies at each facility influ ences the emission rates of the flowering rooms. These  large variations suggest large uncertainties in any attempt  to build flower room emission inventories on average or on  limited strain-specific emission rate data. 
The facilities also reported the amount of biomass pre sent in the sampled drying rooms in Table S6 of the  supplemental documents. Based on these values, normal ized emission rates for the drying rooms are shown in  Table 3. The largest emission rate of 1.16E–3 kg/hr/kg  was measured in the drying room of Facility A. The emis sions in the drying room were higher than those found in  the flower rooms. The highest emission rate in the flower  rooms was 3.14E–4 kg/hr/kg in Facility A. Since the facil ities provided plant counts for the flowering and vegetative  rooms, an emission rate per plant was also calculated and is  shown in Table 3. As expected, the younger plants found in  the vegetative room had the lowest emission rates of 8.11E–  6 kg/hr/plant. The emission rates in the flowering rooms,  however, were 1–2 orders of magnitude higher with the  largest rate found in Facility D’s flower room with a value of  3.62E–4 kg/hr/plant. 
A sensitivity analysis was completed to estimate the  magnitude of loss rates due to chemical losses and uncer tainties in the AER. For loss of VOCs by chemical reac tions, we consider reactions with O3 and the OH radical.  Many of the primary monoterpenes emitted are very reac tive with O3. We assume that O3 can only enter the space  by ventilation of outdoor air (i.e., there are no O3 generat ing devices in use in the buildings). Therefore, we can put  
JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION 329
an upper bound on the fraction of monoterpenes lost by  assuming that all O3 that enters is titrated by monoter penes and that one molecule of O3 removes one mono terpene molecule. For example, the summed concentration  of monoterpenes in the flower room of Facility B was  1.05E13 molecules/cm3 and a typical background (out door) O3 mixing ratio is 50 ppb (1.23E12 molecules/cm3)  (Pfister et al. 2019). Therefore, the total monoterpene  concentration could have been as high as 1.17E13  molecules/cm3 (11% higher) in the absence of O3 chem istry. Across all facilities, the summed concentration of  monoterpenes ranged from 1E13 to 1E14, suggesting that  the upper bound loss of monoterpenes by reaction with O3  is in the range of 1–10%. An estimate of mass removal rate  of biogenic VOCs by full titration of O3 by room and  facility is shown in Table 3. To estimate the removal rate  by reaction with OH, the median of reported values for  kOH, 1.0E–10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, was chosen (Atkinson  1997). A high value of the measured indoor concentration  for COH of 1.8E6 molecules cm−3 was assumed (Gomez  Alvarez et al. 2013). Therefore, the removal rate of a typical  monoterpene is approximately 0.6/h. For Facility B, this is  about 1/10 the air change rate (5.5/h) and therefore would  be responsible for up to a ~ 10% underprediction of emis sion rates, compared with assuming no chemistry occurs.  For Facility A, with an air change rate of 30/h, the under 
prediction is <0.5%. The estimated mass removal rate of  total biogenic VOCs by reaction with OH (Equation (6)) is  provided in Table 3. To improve the estimates of removal  by reaction with O3 and OH, a more detailed indoor  chemistry model would need to be applied (Carslaw 2007). 
Although the AERs were reported by each facility, they  were not directly measured at the time of sampling.  Further, AERs can vary widely among facilities based on  their HVAC method. Given this uncertainty, AERs could  be substantially higher or lower than reported. Emission  rates as determined by Equation (6) are proportional to  air exchange rates. For example, if air exchange rates are  25% higher or lower than reported, then actual emission  rates will be 25% higher or lower. Although the air  exchange rate is among the largest sources of uncertainty,  estimates of the air exchange rate by decay of PID signals  in the trimming room of Facility B (~4/h-6/h) were con sistent with the reported value of 5.5/h. 
Discussion and conclusion 
This study found that the magnitude of biogenic VOC  emissions for cannabis cultivation varies widely through out rooms within a facility, with the highest emissions  found during post-harvest activities (i.e., trimming), and  the lowest rates in the vegetative room. Plant harvesting  also generates green leaf volatiles (Ameye et al. 2018) not

measured in the targeted Tenax tube analysis that will  contribute to the PID signal data and increase overall  biogenic VOC emission rates. The higher emissions during  post-harvest activities were likely due to the physical dis 
turbance of the harvested plants in trimming and were  further enhanced with the vigorous movement caused by  mechanical methods. This is consistent with findings from  other studies that have found that surfaces of female flowers  contain storage of resins rich in terpenoids which are likely  being disturbed by these physical disturbances (Zager et al.  2019). These data suggest that the largest emission sources  of VOCs are found post-harvest and emission inventories  based solely on cultivation emissions will underestimate  total biogenic VOC emissions. Biogenic VOC emission  rates were also determined in a 2019 study at four cannabis  growing facilities located in California and Nevada.  Researchers reported the biogenic VOC emission rate for  the grow room of one facility, with a value of 7.4E–4 kg/  day/plant (Samburova et al. 2019). A 2018 leaf enclosure  study in Denver found a maximum VOC emission rate of  2.4E–4 kg/day/kg biomass (Wang et al. 2019a). For this  study, rates were found to be higher than the previous  studies, but within the same order of magnitude. There  are no comparable studies for emission rates found in post harvest activities. This is significant as this study showed  the highest emissions were from these post-cultivation  activities. 
In this study, the dominant measured monoter penes throughout all facilities from cultivation to  post harvest were: β-myrcene, terpinolene, and  D-limonene. These top monoterpenes were also pre sent at the exhaust points at each of the cannabis  cultivation facilities where this study occurred (Urso  et al. 2022). These same species were measured from  a 2019 sampling of facilities in California and  Nevada (Samburova et al. 2019). This study also  reported a similar finding that eucalyptol was not  a dominant species (Samburova et al. 2019). In  2019, an ambient field campaign completed in  Denver also observed that β-myrcene and  D-limonene were the dominant monoterpenes  (Wang et al. 2020). Despite the diversity of cannabis  strains grown at each facility, operational parameters,  facility design, and sampling methodology, the domi nant biogenic VOCs remain consistent. 
Biogenic VOC emissions within indoor cannabis  cultivation facilities could have potential impacts on  both indoor and outdoor air quality via the chemi cal production of O3 and PM (Urso et al. 2022;  Wang et al. 2019b). The data provided here is an  important first step in building a cannabis facility  emissions inventory of biogenic VOCs that could be  
used to inform on potential worker safety exposures  and outdoor air quality impacts. Furthermore, these  inventories could provide help in the design of  HVAC and the sizing of mitigation technology.  Our data suggest that the large variability in emis 
sion rates across facilities introduces uncertainty in  current biogenic emission inventories used for  modeling studies (Urso et al. 2022; Wang et al.  2019b). It is also important to note that this study  had a small sample size, and given the large varia 
bility found in the industry, more sampling across  different kinds of facilities is needed to understand  the range of possible emission rates. This should  also include the measurement of VOCs used in the  extraction of concentrates with industrial solvents  (Valizadehderakhshan et al. 2021). For example,  a 2019 study found that concentrate manufacturing  produced concentrations up to 43,000 μg/m3 of  butane (Samburova et al. 2019). To minimize these  uncertainties in emission inventories will require  site-specific information on AER, plant counts, can nabis strains, biomass, and types of hand or  mechanical processing. All these activities and  industrial solvents must be considered in the devel 
opment of a cannabis emission inventory.
