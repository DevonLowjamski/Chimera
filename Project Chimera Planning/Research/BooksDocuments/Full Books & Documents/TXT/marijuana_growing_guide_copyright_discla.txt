Introduction 
Welcome, I'm so stoked for you! You now have access to the sum total of over 18 plus years of intense research and practice involving attempts at figuring out the most effective way to cultivate the best cannabis on Earth. I have taught, learned from, and helped many medicinal marijuana growers discover the 
absolute best way biologically possible to grow the most elite, top-caliber 
sparkling THC rich potent sticky dank buds as fast as possible - And now I'm passing this awesome information on to you so that you can grow your own incredible bud. In only a short time after finishing up reading this book, you will be smoking a seemingly bottomless supply of some of the most sensational, best tasting, highly potent euphoric-inducing bud you have ever experienced.  
If you are an absolute beginner, then I suggest you use this guide as an A to Z complete walk-through encompassing virtually everything you need to know to learn how to grow some killer weed. No worries - I have specifically designed this book in a way that is clear, concise, and easy to follow along. Feel free to grab a notebook and a pen, you're going to learn a lot! I hope you're excited!!! 
I want to congratulate you on taking this massive step for your own personal cannabis cultivation career. You now have access to one of the most newest up to-date detailed guides that will shave literally years off of your learning curve; in other words – you're starting off on a very good foot. If you apply half of the information I will be presenting to you here, I am confident you will be ecstatic with the results you will achieve with your treasured buds. If you're intermediate or advanced feel free to skip ahead to any chapter that you need to study up on and use the book as an encyclopedia reference in order to suit your individual growing needs, as I'm certain you will learn a lot of really cool tricks, tips & other marijuana grower gems along the way! 
Over the last few years I've have seen a sharp increase in the cost of street cannabis, and a rapid decline in its already sketchy quality. My father used to always say, “The greatest problem mankind faces today is the classic conflict between the artist and the producer. It's a basic Tug-O-War between quality vs. distribution. Just look at movies, they're literally developed on an assembly line nowadays. Rushed processing. Cinemas are not an art form anymore, it's a dirty

business! Market value mass appeal butchers the authentic message the 
creators want to get across...” As you will soon discover, one of the greatest benefits to growing your own cannabis is the unbeatable quality of your very own grown herb. It is rare to find something in life as good as your own supply of herb grown by yourself. Never again will you have to worry about dodgy sources or wasting cash on toxic, overpriced, impotent buds. The days of 
unknown bud (that may or may not be packed filled with chemicals and other health hazards that disrupt the taste, potency, and aroma in order to increase profit) are over. Growing your own green means you get to ditch the dealer.  
Marijuana growing is a lot of fun! The more you know, the more tricks you will invent by yourself to get the most out of your yields. Some of the best cannabis growers are very exotic with their grow methods. A number of people have invented so many amazing methods to grow bigger and better cannabis plants. I sincerely hope with the help of this guide you will learn a lot of awesome growing methods and strategies and hopefully develop some of your very own. 
A word of caution: Don't become discouraged if your first growing attempts are a total disaster. One of the cool things about this book is that I'm going to be outlining the most common growing errors. I can't promise you that you wont make mistakes, as you most likely will at first while learning, but I have clearly described many of them here so you'll have a game plan and know exactly what to avoid. The chances of you messing up your precious plants will be greatly reduced by following this guide properly. No worries, you're in good hands.  
This book is massive. It contains virtually everything you need to know to grow elite bud successfully. At first glance you may become overwhelmed at all the wealth of information. Relax, I recommend you use this book like a 
walkthrough. It's like my dad always used to say; “How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time of course!” Reference back to sections as your grow 
progresses, as needed. Feel free to skip ahead to research any particular section that interests you. If you are a first time grower just follow along, I'm going to take you by the hand and show you step-by-step how to grow your very own awesome bud supply. So without further ado... let's grow! 
And remember, always keep it GREEN, LOVING and full of LIGHT.

Growing Marijuana 
Growing your own marijuana is exciting and fun! Homegrown cannabis is not only ideal for the small-time closet enthusiast, but also serves as a lucrative career in the realm of industrial weed farmers. It is great for those looking to generate an income ranging from part-time extra pocket cash to a full booming business, and even better for those looking to ditch dealers with ridiculous top shelf prices so they can grow their own amazing bud. Marijuana growers can grow their own unlimited supply of A-Grade ganja practically for free! 
Whether cultivated indoors or outdoors, with hydroponics or with soil, in order for marijuana to grow well it needs six essential foundational things: 
1. Light. (Must be the proper spectrum, intensity, and duration). 
2. Water. (Must be abundant but NOT excessive). 
3. Air. (Must be ideal temperature, flowing great, and rich in CO2). 
4. Nutrients. (Must contain the right amounts). 
5. A Growing Medium. (Has to have the right texture and ingredients). 
6. Optimal environmental conditions. (heat, humidity, etc). 
Growing marijuana today is exploding exponentially in popularity. Many 
authorities are referring to this sudden spike of interest as the “green rush”. We're on a rising wave of green that's sweeping the globe. Now more than ever is an exciting time to jump right in and learn how to grow your own crops.  
A great benefit of growing your own cannabis is that most of the stuff out there that is commercially grown is grown based on factors of the buds overall look, and the plant's yield amount. Often the quality of the high is entirely neglected as it tends not to be a selling point. The highs you can experience when 
growing your own plants is phenomenal!!!  
Many agree the best reason for growing your own is the enjoyment you will get out of watching those tiny little seeds you picked out of your stash sprout and become some of the most lovely and lush of all house plants, and not to 
mention the incredible dank buds you will produce for a lifetime supply of 
delicious greens to enjoy.

Marijuana 
Marijuana, the Indian hemp plant, Cannabis Sativa(cannabis), is a drug 
composed of leaves and flowers. It is usually dried and crushed and put into pipes or formed into cigarettes(“joints” or “blunts”) for smoking. The drug, known by a variety of other names, including pot, trees, grass, bud, and weed, can also be added to foods and beverages. Marijuana varies in potency, 
depending on where and how it is grown, prepared for use, or stored.  
  

Cannabis is the only plant that produces chemicals known as Cannabinoids. These cannabinoids are psychoactive and are responsible for the various effects of marijuana. Not all, but many cannabinoids get you high. 
  

6 
  

The most important cannabinoid and active ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is present in all parts of both the male and female plants but is most concentrated in the resin(cannabin) in the flowering tops of the female. Hashish, a more powerful form of the drug, is made by collecting and drying this resin and is about eight times as strong as the marijuana typically smoked in the United States. Dried flower tops (buds) of potent marijuana can contain up to 25% THC.  
Mentioned in a Chinese herbal documents dating from 2700 BC, marijuana long 
has been considered valuable as an analgesic, an anesthetic, an antidepressant, an antibiotic, and a sedative. Although it was usually used externally(e.g., as a balm or smoked), in the 19th century its tips were sometimes administered internally to treat gonorrhea and angina pectoris.  
The effect that cannabis has on the user depends on the strength, how often it's smoked, how recently it was smoked and how the body naturally reacts to the drug. 
  

7 
Positive Effects of Marijuana: 
  
Mood lift 
  
Relaxation, stress reduction, calming 
  
Creative, philosophical or deep thinking...ideas flow more easily and 
tends to be more creative when under the influence 
  
Increased appreciation of music 
Increased awareness of senses(tasting, feeling, smell) 
Change in experience of muscle fatigue. Pleasant body feel. Increase in body/mind connection 
Pain relief(headaches, cramps, and various others) 
Reduced nausea(also used medically for this purpose) 
Much more.... :) 
Neutral Effects of Marijuana: 
Increased appetite; “munchies” 
General change in consciousness(as with many psychoactives). 
Sleepiness 
Blood shot red eyes(more common with certain varieties of cannabis and inexperienced users) 
Mouth dryness aka “Cotton mouth” 
Temporarily interrupts linear memory 
Difficulty following a train of thought, can be slightly A.D.D. 
Cheek, jaw, facial tension(less commonly reported)

8 
Negative Effects of Marijuana: 
Nausea 
Coughing, asthma, upper respiratory problems 
Difficulty with short-term memory during effects and during periods of 
heavy frequent use 
Slowness and delayed reactions, especially dangerous when driving or 
operating machinery 
Racing heart, agitation, and tenseness 
Mild to severe anxiety 
Panic attacks at very high doses(usually oral) or in sensitive users 
Headaches 
Dizziness, confusion, vomiting 
Possible psychological dependence development on cannabis 
"Mild" withdrawal symptoms occur after daily use in some users. These may last for 1-6 weeks after cessation of use and can include anxiety, 
anhedonia(reduced experience of pleasure), headaches, general 
unease/discomfort, difficulty sleeping, and a strong desire to smoke pot. 
Using Marijuana 
There are various ways to make use of marijuana... 
Smoking/Inhaling: Burning or vaporizing cannabis and inhaling the smoke into the lungs is the fastest route to the blood stream. Conventional wisdom is that holding in the smoke increases the effects felt. Recent research shows the opposite; it causes more harm to the lungs without increasing the amount of THC absorbed. Studies done in Australia indicate that 95% of the THC in 
cannabis is absorbed in the first few seconds of inhaling. Holding in the smoke longer just allows more tar and other noxious chemicals to be absorbed. Take

9 
small, shallow puff s rather than deep inhalations. Irritation of the throat and lungs is one of the most obvious adverse effects to the marijuana smoker as is the inevitable cough upon inhaling. The cough is the body's reaction to the irritation of the numerous constituents of the smoke. Prolonged and repeated exposure to these irritants can lower resistance to, and aggravate infections from viruses, bacteria, or fungi. The lesser coughing, the safer the smoke. The fewer puff s the better; the more potent the cannabis used is the fewer puff s required. For these reasons, it is preferable to use only the more potent flower tops, or high grade hash for smoking use. 
Despite the obvious dangers of inhaling hot smoke, there is evidence that in some cases(ie. asthma) smoking could be a beneficial medical use of cannabis. Another advantage of smoking is that it allows the user to control their dosage better as the effects are almost immediate, unlike when eating, or using THC in pill or spray form. 
In general however, smoking is not the best way to take cannabis, especially for pain, being a less efficient use of the herb than eating. However, many medical users find they appreciate the immediate and pleasurable effects of smoking cannabis and the harm of smoking can be reduced in various ways. One 
alternative to inhaling smoke is to release the THC through Vaporization; 
inhaling vapor rather than smoke, see vaporization. 
Pipes and Bongs: Many ingeniously designed products are on the market that claim to offer a cooler smoke but they are not all safe or efficient to use. Avoid wood, aluminum or plastic materials. Use glass, stainless steel or brass pipes and bongs. 
Joints: Smoking cannabis in ‘joints’ is one of the least harmful ways of 
smoking. A loose, fat joint is preferable to a thin one because the temperature of the smoke is lower in a thick joint. Mixing cannabis with tobacco counteracts the positive effects of THC. Some research suggests that Cannabis may actually off set some of the harmful effects of tobacco but there is also evidence that the relaxing effects of cannabis on the lungs allows the toxins in tobacco to get in deeper. There is evidence that a thin joint gives a more stimulating ‘high’, while a fat joint has a more sedative effect(due to different burn temp in ‘fat’ or ‘thin’

10 
joints). Avoid rolling papers with 'strawberry' tasting chemicals and the like, 'rainbows' and any use of colored inks. 
Water Pipes: Recent research suggests that water pipes are the most harmful and least efficient methods of smoking cannabis. The water absorbs a great deal of the THC in the smoke(up to 50%!), increasing the amount of tar the smoker must ingest to get the desired result. Using a water pipe with a 
mouthpiece less than 20cm from the water level can allow water vapor and water drops to enter the lungs. 
Vaporization: Using a vaporizer which heats but does not burn the cannabis, is an alternative to smoking. The process involves releasing the THC as vapor which is inhaled rather than smoke. The effect is ‘clearer’ and it is far 
more economical and reduces the exposure of the throat and lungs to products of burning. Vaporization works because THC, the active ingredient of cannabis, is a resin that vaporizes at a lower combustion(burning) point than cellulose. 
You can make your own vaporizer very cheaply or buy various types starting at around £35 up to £300+ for the 'hospital standard' 'Volcano’. High heat destroys some of the THC in smoked cannabis(estimates vary). Vaporizers heat it more gently; the THC molecules decarboxylate and evaporate in a whitish vapor. A problem with vaporizers is with correct use. Many users tend to overheat and consequently burn the stuff. They are now 'smoking' not 'vaporizing' the 
cannabis, often without realizing - and just as many toxic tars are released as smoking in a pipe.  
Vaporizers sometimes fail to satisfy longtime recreational smokers who associate burning lungs with getting high. They distrust the incredibly smooth taste of the vapors, and they don't like waiting 20 seconds to 1 minute for each hit. 
However they always like the fact that their supply seems to last up to four times as long because vaporization wastes so little of the active ingredients lost through smoking. Some regular users of vaporizers have complained that they produce a fine dust along with the vapor. This can't be good and they should maybe be fitted with a filter system but vaporizers are still the safest way to consume cannabis using heat.

11 
Eating or Drinking: Simply sucking a small piece of hashish or eating cannabis prepared as a cake, drink or other food is a very effective and economical 
method of using cannabis. The effects take up to an hour and last 4-12 
hours. Over dose is possible by eating too much. This could result in an 
unpleasant ‘whirlingpit’ feeling but no lasting physical damage. If in doubt 
slowly sample the dose; experiment with a little, and then a little more. More worrying are the dangers of adulteration and infection encouraged by the 
unregulated trade in cannabis. These include smuggling methods and 
profiteering practices which can make eating the resulting product totally 
undesirable. In general avoid eating most hash especially ‘Soap Bar’ and ‘Manali’ or 'Squiggie' black. Eating Hemp seeds or their oil(which have no THC content) is a very valuable source of nutrition; a quality which can have considerable medical value and contribute to general well 
being. 
Tinctures: The active ingredients of the plant are extracted as oil and can then be used either as drops taken orally, or the ingredient for creams and lotions to be rubbed on the skin to relieve pain and other symptoms. 
Creams and Lotions: Applied on the skin to treat complaints ranging from muscle pain and/or tremors to ache. You can make these your self. The simplest way to do this is to put leaves and buds of cannabis into a bottle filled with surgical alcohol available in any chemist. Leave in a dark place for 1-3 weeks, shaking every day or as often as possible, then use to rub on area suffering from pain. 
What Gets You High 
The main factors in determining the quality and intensity of the high are the amount, and the ratio of cannabinoids present in your bud. Cannabinoids are what are responsible for getting that sensational soaring high out of your buds. Currently there are more than 40 known cannabinoids, but most of these occur in very tiny amounts and aren't important to the quality of the high. The 
cannabinoids that are found in the greatest quantity and have the most 
influence on your bud's high are THC, CBN THCV, and CBC. 

12 
THC(tetrahydrocannabinol) is the main psychoactive ingredient In marijuana. It accounts for most of the high. THC occurs in all varieties of cannabis. 
CBD(cannabidiol) occurs in almost all cannabis varieties in quantities that range from trace amounts to 95 percent of all cannabinoids present. In its pure form CBD is not psychoactive, but it does have sedative, antibiotic, and analgesic qualities. CBD contributes to the high by interacting with THC to potentiate or antagonize certain qualities of the high. In general, it potentiates the depressant effects and antagonizes the euphoric effects. CBD is also known for delaying the onset of the high, but makes it last much longer. So THC-CBD ratios are very important when considering the effects of your high. Keep in mind that the ratios of cannabinoids found in different varieties of cannabis plants also tend to vary greatly.  
THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) 

THC is the active psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that gets a user high. Without it, or in extremely low amounts – you don't get high. All plant's THC levels vary greatly. Some plants can have THC levels of 100%, yet the quantity of the THC isn't high so it's less potent. On the other hand, some plants may only have 50% THC, but the levels will be very high. A good potent plant(one we intend to teach you how to grow using this book) will have both high levels and quantities of THC. 

13 
The key difference between THC levels and THC quantities is that THC levels are genetically predetermined. This means that they are not under the influence of the grower. THC quantities though are in fact controllable by the grower. When growing weed, the THC quantities are basically bud mass and how much resin can be generated.  
To determine how potent a plant is when examining strains check for the THC levels to determine the potential potency of the plant. Nowadays many 
seedbanks clearly accurately state their strains' legitimate THC levels, but there are also a lot of shady seed dealers out there too who over-exaggerate their THC levels(read on to find out about some recommended reputable suppliers).  
CBD (Cannabidiol) 

CBD is what amplifies certain effects of THC and depresses others. CBD is an isomer of THC, which means they share the same molecular formula, but have different structural formulas. Basically they are made up of the exact same molecules, except that the molecules are connected in different orders.  
CBD by itself has no psychoactive properties(CBD by itself does not get you high), however it does regulate the euphoric effect of THC and gives it more of a sedative effect(more of a "chill" high). Cannabis often has a high CBD content (as much or more than 40% CBD in most Cannabis extracts). 
High THC and low CBD produce a strong clear headed, more energetic high. Low THC and high CBD produces a stoned lethargic feeling, a heavy sluggish tired body and a dull feeling mind. High levels of both THC and CBD produces a

14 
strong, almost dreamlike high.  
To sum things up, if you want a more energetic high, you want more THC and less CBD. Usually Sativa and Sativa-dominant hybrids have more THC and less CBD. If you want a more relaxed high, then of course your want more CBD, usually found in Indica and Indica-dominant hybrids. But remember CBD on its own does nothing; it only regulates effects of the THC high. So regardless if you want a high THC content, the difference is the ratio of CBD to THC.  
Marijuana is just like any other plant that is grown. It needs a combination of proper abundant light, warm CO2 rich air, clean water, and sufficient nutrients in the grow medium to ensure vigorous growth. When these conditions are 
optimum, your harvest is optimum. Of course there are more factors to take into consideration, but for right now, these are the basics you need to understand. 
The end goal is to grow a non-pollinated female plant(known as “Sinsemilla”), that is flowering and producing lots and lots of buds with resin glands(that contain high levels and amounts of THC) aka “dank potent big frosty buds” that provide a sensational smoke. Weed is always grown from the female plant. Another crucial part of growing is to properly clean, cure, and process the plants so that enables you to enjoy the full flavor, smell, potency, and taste of the plant.  
First you must decide whether or not you want to grow indoors or outdoors. Why Grow Indoors? 
Growing indoors is very popular. The benefits of growing marijuana indoors is that you have 100% full control of the environment that you simply cannot regulate outdoors - that means you are guaranteed to get a good quality plant virtually every time and be able to keep your plants safe during their delicate growth cycles. Growing indoors can make way for some seriously wicked bud. Indoor growing means you have complete control over the humidity, optimal temperature, nutrients, lighting, and so many other crucial factors that are essential for the plants thriving growth. In addition you also have full control over when and how to flower your plants by illuminating them, as you do not

15 
when growing outdoors. It is also much safer to grow indoors.  
Therefore it is of the opinion of many growers that the quality of marijuana grown indoors is far superior to marijuana grown outdoors, which is essential if you are going to be selling to picky clientele.


16 

There are of course disadvantages to growing marijuana indoors. Natural sunlight is the best source of lighting for any Earthly crop. Indoor lighting is powerful, but nothing comes close to the solar orb. Also, ventilation issues are often a big concern for indoor growers. An enclosed area often generates heat and lacks sufficient fresh air. Both of these problems can be easily remedied with a proper ventilation system though(discussed in detail later). Also before deciding, keep in mind growing indoors, depending on the space you choose, 
will generally tend to produce smaller crops. Depending on the space you decide to grow in, the crops usually will not reach the height they normally would outdoors. 


17 
Why Grow Outdoors? 
Growing outdoors can save you lots of money when it comes to lighting. 
Outdoor cannabis plants will use the greatest source of light, the sun, which is free! But, keep in mind when growing outdoors the photoperiod tends to be much more gradual so it takes longer for the plants to fully bloom out during flowering. One great benefit of growing outdoors is that you do not have to worry about changing your air supply regularly and constantly, as outdoors this occurs naturally with an abundance of fresh air all the time being supplied to your plants. 

18 
Now let's talk numbers. If you grow 10 plants indoors with a 400 watt metal halide grow light, each plant will yield about ½ to 1 ounce of marijuana. (Don't worry, we have some tips later that will show you how to increase yield, but for now these are average guidelines.) A single plant grown outdoors will yield about a pound(16 ounces) of marijuana, or sometimes even more!  
There are also downsides to growing outdoors. You have no control over light cycles and must grow on the natural annual harvest cycle, you have absolutely no privacy and some areas require you to take privacy precautions in order to grow for medical use. Outdoors you have open ventilation which means your plants could be pollinated by wild pollen messing up your attempts to breed seed of a certain strain or avoid seed. You are also mostly limited to soil grows outdoors unless you have a greenhouse which is sort of a hybrid of indoor and outdoor growing. 
So remember that generally outdoors = massive yields, lower quality due to lack of environmental control. Indoors = lower yields, much higher quality.  
What is better - hydroponics or soil?  
Indoor growers are initially faced with a very important choice. Do they go with a hydroponic system, or soil? On one hand you have soil, the traditional growth medium that has been used for thousands of years to grow plants, and on the other you've got hydroponics, a more recent practice of growing plants with water and nutrients but no soil.  
For a first time grower it is popular opinion that the "better", more convenient setup is soil. Hydroponics makes plants grow faster, but when starting out, unless you learn extremely quickly it generally won't make your buds more potent than soil(at first). Hydroponics should be attempted after you have a few successful soil crops under your belt, or if you feel you will be able to jump right in successfully without becoming overwhelmed. If you are starting from seed and growing for personal use, soil is the practical growing medium. If the crop is started with clones and is commercial, a hydroponics setup is then definitely more practical.

19 
It is of popular opinion that soil is far superior in terms of quality factors such as bud taste and flavor. People pay fortunes for the best quality, so soil is ideal for this reason. It is also cheaper on your wallet. Many growers also find that soil is more forgiving. If you make a mistake with hydroponics the damage can be drastic and irreversible. 
A hydroponics garden's nutrient and root setup aids in faster plant development, but it takes a lot of monitoring. Hydroponic gardens benefit the overall growth of the plant in terms of size - root systems are spread throughout soil in order to increase surface area and the chance that the plant will absorb minerals and water that permeate through the grow medium.  
With hydroponically grown plants, the nutrients are present all throughout the liquid mixture. That way, the root system does not have to be as extensive as with soil-based plants. This means that the plant can devote more nutrients and energy to growth above the root system, which is the kind of growth that leads to potent big buds.  
As plants grown in soil begin to grow larger their root systems begin to cramp. They then must be placed in a larger container, or transplanted. Hydroponically grown cannabis does not need to be transplanted. This saves time and 
increases growing efficiency greatly(hydroponically grown plants do not have to deal with problems such as “transplant shock”). 

20 
Hydroponic grow mediums are definitely an improvement over traditional soil 
when it comes to speed of production and overall yield, but it is much easier to grow marijuana in soil. 
It is not that difficult to set up and operate a hydroponic system, but one detail like a faulty irrigation timer can cause devastation if not immediately corrected. 
The hydroponic solution must be monitored closely and kept balanced, while a well prepared soil solution may not need any additional fertilizers for the entire life of the plant. As long as you water the soil when it gets dry the plant will thrive and be happy. 
Soil-grown pot is considered by many to have a more palatable taste than 
hydroponically grown herb, but there are always exceptions to such rules. Some growers get the best of both worlds by experimenting with organic hydroponics, but most use basic stock solutions that contain fertilizer salts in a readily 
available form.

21 
These salts are easy to administer in tried-and-true formulas, but the problem is that these stock solutions tend to leave a metallic taste in the precious produce. Experienced growers know to leach their plants before harvest to remove 
residual salts from the buds, but it appears that few bother to leach sufficiently for a truly clean, pure taste. 
A milder feed solution will prevent the build-up of excess fertilizer salts in the bud. Leaching time varies from grower to grower, from two days to two weeks. Some use plain or distilled water, others simply use a very diluted feed solution. 
For the newbie grower, soil is definitely a great choice. A Hydroponics setup takes up more room, is less stealthy(along with the noise), plus the care and monitoring of the system, and high costs are often too much for a newbie first starting out. But, as cannabis cultivation gains widespread popularity, easy to use inexpensive all-in-one hydroponic grow systems are available for 
purchasing.  
(For tips on choosing the right hydroponic system for you, please refer to the hydroponic section.)


22 
Strains 
The first step for growing your own buds is to obtain some good marijuana seed strains. This first crucial step to reaping the highest quality and quantity yields is starting off on the right foot with with the best Cannabis strain seeds you can get. Genetics determine the quality of the maturing plants, so what you want to look for are strains with favorable genetics. Potency, aroma, fast growth, early maturation, and resistance to fungus & pests are a good start. The best seeds come from the best plants, and vice versa.  

Each variety is either a “pure” species type(taking two plants in the same 
species and crossing them) or a “crossbreed” of two or more species(taking two plants from different species and crossing them). Examples are Pure Sativa, Sativa(mostly sativa species with indica), Pure Indica, Indica(mostly Indica with some Sativa),and Indica/Sativa Hybrid(this is a 50/50 cross between a Sativa and Indica species). 
If you are serious about producing marijuana, don't settle for any available seed you can get, go for the best.  
(Later I will show you my top recommended reliable seed banks who offer quality seed strains at low prices with stealth discrete shipping near the end of this section, so slow your wheels Turbo.)

23 
So first things first, what exactly does the term “strain” 
mean?  
Well, a marijuana strain is simply what sets the marijuana apart. It offers unique characteristics. Veteran growers can recognize these specific on-the-market strains just by mere observation.  
Most strains of marijuana are derived from two species of cannabis, they are Cannabis Indica and Cannabis Sativa. Both species have very unique 
characteristics that affect the user differently. If you are a complete beginner than we highly suggest you start your first batch off with Indica in order to learn how to grow properly. As you gain more experience you can craft an 
Indica/Sativa “hybrid” mix, and then eventually a complete Sativa strain. 
An Indica/Sativa mix will yield a larger crop that is not as tall as a pure Sativa, but THC level will be lower and CBD levels will be higher. If you are growing indoors this Inidca/Sativa hybrid is strongly recommended due to it having the best high and best indoor growth characteristics. Sativas are hard to grow 
indoors due to specific height requirements and late flowering tendencies, so a hybrid can be bred that will have the energetic cerebral high of the Sativa and the early maturation & “easy-to-grow” characteristics of the Indica plant.


24 
Cannabis Indica 
Physical Characteristics: 
Height – Squat and dense with heavy, compact buds. 
Nodes – Has long internodes between branches, averaging 3-6 inches. 
Leaf – Broad pointy leaves with no markings or patterns, rounded on the sides. Indica leaves are wide with short fingers.  

Indica's originally come from the hash producing countries of the world like Afghanistan, Tibet, and Morocco. They are short dense plants, with broad leaves and often grow a darker green. After flowering starts they will be mature in 6 to 8 weeks. The buds will be thick and dense, with flavors and aromas ranging from pungent skunk to sweet and fruity.  
Indica has higher CBD and lower THC levels than Sativa. In laymens terms this means marijuana from a pure Cannabis Indica strain will produce a heavy, 
stony, tiresome sleepy type of stone in the user. As far as the yield of Cannabis Indica plants goes, it is usually higher than Cannabis Sativa plants, and they take a little bit less time to mature. Indica buds tend to be smelly - they smell like a pungent bad body odor. Their smoke is thick, even a small toke will often induce fits of coughing! A Pure Indica high has the properties of a body stone / couch potato feel. The smoke from an Indica is generally a body type stone, relaxing and laid back. The best Indicas have a relaxing social high, which 
allows the person to sense and feel the environment, but does not lead to 
thinking or over-analyzing the experience. Poor quality Indica marijuana and hashish contain high quantities of CBD. This is where the toker becomes lead headed and sleepy.

25 
Note: For desirable medical marijuana you should grow a plant low in THC and rich in CBD. Let the plant vegetate for a longer period of time and harvest when all pistils have attained their color, i.e. as late as possible. More on this later. 
Cannabis Indica strains are easier to grow and don't get as tall as Cannabis Sativa strains, but they tend to be bushier and have to be grown further apart. They tend to be thick and strong, they can take more cold than the sativa - overall they are just a tougher plant. This is why the Indica strain is best for newbies and when growing in an area where height is a consideration, like a small closet or cabinet. (If you have your heart set on growing sativa as a 
beginner, then we recommend a Northern Lights cross, as this is a very easy to grow Sativa strain indoors).  
So the great thing about growing an Indica strain is that it produces a higher yield, is much easier to grow, it's shorter in height, and it grows and matures faster. At maturity, the leaves start to turn a dark purple. It has short branches laden with thick, dense buds, which mature early. Indica plants tend to be short, bushy, mature early, have more chlorophyll and less accessory pigments 
(accessory pigments protect the plant from excessive sunlight). As Indica strains have more chlorophyll than Sativa they grow and mature faster. 
The only downside is that Indica tends to be less potent, and usually doesn't taste as good. Under artificial light an Indica plant will mature faster than a Sativa. Approximately four weeks of extra light is required to bring a Sativa plant to maturity, and even then its' weight is often much lower. Therefore, Indica tends to be a favorite among industrial weed farmers. More Indica strains are grown for sales-specific goals, making the dealer/grower richer.

26 
Cannabis Sativa  
Physical Characteristics: 
Height – Tall and hardy with fluffy buds. 
Nodes – Has short internodes between branches, averaging 3 inches or less. Leaf – Narrow finger-like rounded leaves with marble-like patterns. Slender, with long fingers. 

Sativa has higher THC content and lower CBD levels than Indica. This means that marijuana from a pure Sativa strain produces a more cognitive(in the 
brain), “floating” type of high that tends to be more energetic when compared with pure Indica. Sativa buds smell sweet, fruity and perfumed, and their smoke is usually smooth and easily inhaled. Once flowering has begun, they can take anywhere from 10 to 16 weeks to fully mature. Flavors range from earthy to sweet and fruity. 
They grow very quickly and can reach heights of 20 feet in a single season. They originally come from Colombia, Mexico, Thailand and Southeast Asia. The buds are long and thin(makes for much fluffier lighter bud), far less densely populated than the Indica, although longer in length(sometimes stretching 3ft. in or more along the branch). The stomas of the flowering bud may be tinged slightly purple in a cool climate but in a warmer environment will turn dark orange or even red. Maturation time varies considerably. 
Sativa plants are taller, take longer to mature, have less chlorophyll and more accessory pigments(accessory pigments protect the plant from excessive 
sunlight). As Sativa strains have less chlorophyll than Indica and they take

27 
longer to grow, mature, and require more light. Sativas have a huge root 
system. They are much more drought tolerant than the Indica plant. The yield generally tends to be lower than indica, but the plants are way more potent. The Sativa plants tend to also grow taller, and take longer to mature... so they are best suited for outdoor growing. 
But don't worry, there are certain strains you can get specifically designed for growing indoors. 
The good thing about growing Cannabis Sativa buds is that they are more 
potent and taste really really good. Typically, pure sativas have a high THC/CBD ratio (that is to say, not much CBD), and so they tend to provide clear, buzzy, “up” highs. When smoking a sativa the high is very Cerebral, you have a rush of energy, a buzz in the body and a great way of getting the housework done without vegging out on the couch. On the other hand, pure indicas tend to have much more CBD present. Commercial hash is usually manufactured using the resin of Indicas, explaining its stony, drowsy high.  
The downside? Lower yield, takes longer to mature, and generally harder to grow.  
Note: If your seed has a ratio such as 40% Sativa, 60% Indica then you can 
imagine what the high will be like. It has 40% of the “head high”, and 60% of the “body stone”. 
So remember, Indica plants have a heavy, stony high that is relaxing and can help different medical problems.  
Sativa plants have an energetic, cerebral high which can stimulate brain activity and may produce hallucinations.  
Hybrid strains have a combination of both Indica and Sativa highs which are relative to strain ratio. The leaves of a hybrid tend to be thinner than an Indica, but much broader than a Sativa. Once you get good it is possible to recognize a good hybrid solely by the leaves once you know what to look for.

28 
Choosing Your Variety 
Choosing your cannabis variety is extremely important. 
It really depends on your growing goals. There are 
several key factors to consider when deciding what 
varieties of cannabis you want to grow - the type of 
high, the maturation time, and the shape of the plant 
all are very important. Once you have chosen your 
quality seedbank supplier and have a good idea of  
what type of plant you want to grow, it is now time to 
choose your seeds wisely. 
Many newer growers make the mistake of choosing 
cannabis varieties that favor a high potency thinking 
this is what they want. The quality of high is just as, if 
not more of an important selection factor. 
Note: Be sure to choose the BEST possible seed you can 
get your hands on because later you can produce your 
own seeds and clones from that strain! 
Make sure your seed strains have good genetics. This  
is CRUCIAL. Bad genetics can lead to mutations, 
warping, flowering problems, poor germination 
success rates, ad nauseum. Sometimes even 
problematic nutrient symptoms will appear even though 
your nutrients are fine and you know for a fact a 
nutrient problem does not exist. It is very important to 
find a reputable supplier for top-shelf quality strains 
that are bred with great genetics. 
If you are a first time medicinal grower I would 
recommend Big Bud, Top 44, Northern Lights, or Skunk 
#1. All of these are great – they are the easiest, most 
durable, with great yields. 

29 
Another very important factor to take into consideration when choosing a 
cannabis variety is the plant's yield. Some plants will bud heavily and produce very very thick top colas and others simply wont. A heavy-yielding plant can be worth easily twice as much as a lesser-yielding one. (Remember Indica varieties are great for commercial growing as they produce heavy yields and mature early.) 
If you're commercially growing, in general the type of high does not seem to be an important marketing factor at all. The yield, taste, aroma, and the overall bud appearance are important in determining the final price amount.  
For some, the type of high may be more important to them than their yield amount, and that's OK and very common.  
Note: Feminized seeds produce a higher % of female seeds, but 100% female is never guaranteed 
So again, it all really depends on your individual goals as a grower... 
Don't feel frustrated when at first trying to decide. Because there is large 
selection of strains in the internet, this can sometimes get overwhelming when trying to decide which one to order. Choosing is not as difficult as you may think. There are really only two sides of the marijuana family - Indica's and Sativa's.  
Combining different Indicas, different Sativas or a combination thereof creates hybrids. The resulting hybrid strains will grow, mature and smoke in relationship to the Indica/Sativa percentages they end up containing.

30 
Indoor vs Outdoor Cannabis Seed Varieties 
The next thing to check for is if they are meant for indoor or outdoor 
growing. A lot of new growers argue saying you can use indoor-bred seeds outdoors and vice versa but they will find that trying the opposite does not produce satisfactory results. Outdoor growers want plants that mature early before the arrival of frost, thieves, or pests. Indoor growers generally are 
looking for compact plants that ripen quickly and uniformly(so that light and space are used in the most efficient predictable manner possible).  
So for outdoor marijuana cultivation choose among outdoor intended cannabis seeds strains. Modern marijuana seeds varieties are bred with high level of specialization, take advantage of that and use an outdoor genetics of marijuana seeds for best acclimatization, pest resistance and high natural sunlight 
absorption. 
Whether or not a strain can be grown outdoors also depends on the length of season you have. Take note of listed approximate flowering time. This is most important feature to consider and is completely influenced by the Indica/Sativa ratio. 
Typically you will want plants that will mature before the danger of frost or bad weather comes along. The more Sativa that is in the mix, the longer it takes to finish up. If you have a very long growing season, most strains can be grown outdoors. These flowering periods are approximate and will vary depending on conditions. From this foundational starting point you can then go back to what you like and the descriptions of the plants. 
Plan to grow indoors? Pick a good seedbank and you can browse through a broad range of indoor cannabis seeds strains. Since modern marijuana seeds varieties are bred with high level of specialization, you can get a customized indoor marijuana strain that has genetics favoring shorter plants, higher yields, and quicker growing & flowering.

31 
Height 
When growing cannabis indoors, you have complete control over how tall your plants get. You control this by how long you grow them before initiating 
flowering. Artificial lights do not efficiently penetrate more than 3 feet down into the garden, so it makes little sense to grow them any bigger than that. 
After the light schedule is changed to 12 hours on and 12 hours off, flowering will begin in about 7 to 14 days. During this time the plants will continue to grow another 6 to 14 inches and then stop. How much they will grow depends on the Indica-Sativa ratio of the strain. Sativas will stretch the most. Depending on this ratio, flowering should be initiated at around 18 to 24 inches to achieve the end height of 36 inches. How long it will take to get this tall depends on the strain and the conditions in the garden. 
Potency 
Nearly all of the strains available today are pretty potent. The success of the eventual potency outcome will depend on your personal tastes and the 
conditions in which they are grown. Most seedbanks do not test the THC 
percentages of strains and no one is really sure what the numbers mean when they do. 
Yields 
Yield is primarily determined by the conditions in which the cannabis is grown. But in regards to end yield amount genetics does come into play. All of the yields listed in your seedbank for the strains are approximate and depends a lot on how they are grown and the quality of the environment. Think of it like an average. You can probably get more. (I'm confident you will if you follow the powerful techniques correctly inside this eBook!)  
Indoor lights don't penetrate down very far so it is better to grow a larger 
number of smaller plants to achieve the highest yield of top quality bud. 
Maximum yields indoors are primarily coming from Indicas and mostly Indica hybrids - the more Sativa in the mix, the lower the yields tend to be.

32 
Typically, your indoor yield is really limited only by the amount of light you have, not the strain you choose. It is up to you as a grower to maximize your plant's potential inside your grow space. Experiment to find out how each strain will respond best. 
Flowering Times 
Flowering times are an indication of how long it will take the plant to mature indoor after flowering has been induced by changing the lights to a 12/12 on off light cycle. This will also be affected by the environment to a certain degree, but is pretty much fixed in the plant. 
Indica's are faster flowering than Sativas and hybrids are in relationship to the percentage of each they contain. Sativa's grow very quickly and if you wait too long to flower them they will outgrow the limits of the space and will not fill out. On the other hand, if an Indica is not grown for long enough, the yield can be greatly reduced. 
Growing Near The Equator 
If you live near the Equator the South  
Indian varieties from Tamil and Madya 
Pradish would do very well. These plants  
are very vigorous and flower abundantly  
in India's hot, dry summers. 

33 
Great Choices for Growing Near The Equator: 
Master Kush 
Master Kush x Northern Light 
Shiva 
Northern Light x Shiva 
Hindu Kush 
These varieties are adapted to flower in November and December in India, but with the slightly shorter days in other regions, they will flower a little earlier, maturing in November. Other varieties that you also might grow are landraces from Thailand, Cambodia, Jamaica and Brazil and some of the central African countries. 
Afghani 
4 Way (Four way) 
Swazi x Skunk 
Thai x Skunk 
Maroc x Skunk 
You could try some of the mostly Sativa commercial varieties. These are 
adapted for higher latitudes so they will flower several months earlier where you are, ripening in September and October. The Haze varieties may also be of some use. However, your best program might be to use well-adapted Sativas and to make your own crosses with Indicas or Indica-Sativa hybrids. 
Purple Power 
Durban Poison 
Haze 
Haze 19 x Skunk 
Silver Haze

34 
Backcrossing tropical hybrids with Indicas or Sativa-Indica hybrids produce shorter, more controlled plants than the two to three-meter Sativa giants. With 25% Indica heritage, these plants will begin flowering and will mature in 
October, one to one and a half months earlier than the purebreds.

Seeds 
Seeds are the result of sexual propagation of marijuana plants. They contain the genes of both the male and female parent plants. Some plants known as 
hermaphrodites, produce both male and female flower's on the same plant. The genetics code contained within the tiny seed will determine the plant's size, pest resistance, root stem leaf and flower production, cannabinoid level and many other vital factors. Strong seeds produce healthy plants, and heavy 
harvest. And you can only get strong seeds from a strong healthy parent.  

Selecting Viable Seeds 
One of The most important decisions a grower makes when growing marijuana is choosing a starting Grade-A Quality seed. Seeds vary in size and coloring according to their individual cannabis variety. Bunk seeds = dirt weed. A good seed will not be cracked or deformed. The seed should not be green - a green seed is not fully mature. When selecting your seeds make sure they are not shiny, or excessively dark. These seeds will most likely not germinate. You want your seeds to be hard and dark. 

38 
Indica seeds tend to be larger than Sativa seeds. Indica seeds often have what appears to be “zebra” stripes. This helps you determine the origin and strain of the seeds. For example, if a seed vendor says a particular seed will grow out as Sativa, but the seed is very large, you can bet that the seed is an Indica and 
that the vendor isn't giving you accurate information. Growers select seeds that are plump, oily and healthy-looking. Whitish, light tan, weak, pale, green 
immature or cracked seeds are usually not viable. A seeds viability is determined by pressing it against your fingers or against a hard surface. Bad seeds will crumble.  

Mature seeds that are hard, beige, dark brown and spotted or mottled have the highest germination rate. Soft, pale, or green seeds are usually immature and should be avoided. Keep in mind seed color and pattern are also affected 
naturally by the need for camouflage.  
WARNING: It is very important you choose seeds from plants that are suited to the growing conditions in your garden. You do not want to buy a plant that will grows 10 ft tall when growing inside a cabinet! Following these proper guidelines you can ensure a successful, potent, satisfying grow.  
Weak permeable seeds can allow disease and pests to move in. Stay away from soft, pale, immature, white, fragile seeds that crush easily in between your finger and thumb.

39 
Look for mature seeds that are strong, hard, & beige to a dark-brown. If it's spotted or mottled you can bet it has the highest germination rate. 

Selecting The Proper Genetics 
Since humans have been cultivating cannabis for thousands of years, virtually hundreds of varieties are available to the modern day grower. There are many commercial seedbanks that sell an assortment of award winning time-tested strains. Be sure to select a plant that will survive in the climate it is to be grown in. For example, a plant native to Jamaica, where the growing season is longer, will not be able to complete flowering in Canada. Know the date of the first expected frost and choose a variety that will be ready for harvest before then. If you are growing commercially then the yield per plant is also important. 
Different varieties have different yields. The biggest yielding plants are grown near the equator where the sun is much more intense and the growing season is longer. If these plants are chosen they may have to be finished in a 
greenhouse in the northern US and Canada.

Where To Get Seeds? 
Buying seeds is tricky. If you can't find a friend willing to hook you up with some quality seeds then your next best bet is grabbing your seeds online. There are a lot of sketchy companies out there nowadays. We've heard countless horror stories about online seedbank companies where lots people have payed top dollar for their seeds and never received them. Then the company mysteriously disappeared, with a disconnected phone line and complete with a missing 
website. What a way to blow $200! You need to be extremely careful when buying seeds nowadays. Do not risk it - get them only from a reputable 
company on the internet, from magazines, or any local coffee shops around your town(if available). Stick with a reputable reliable company. You may wish to buy more than you think you will need due to germination failures.  
Note: Marijuana seeds are still illegal in many parts of the world, including the United States. Please check local laws before ordering and always use a safe address. Never order the marijuana seeds directly to your grow area.  
Please be careful! Over the years, I have tried various companies and after speaking with hundreds of growers as well as investing in countless of hours of personal research and money to seek them out & test them; I have determined the following list to be the current best seed banks in the world. If you are going to purchase your seeds from a different vendor, please be safe - google them first in order to make sure they are reliable and no one has been ripped off in the past, as this happens a lot. Make sure they are reputable and carry the most important foundational aspect of your entire grow – a quality seed.  
As promised, here is my highly recommended list of seed banks with reviews. The following list of seedbanks are the most reliable today with the greatest quality and outstanding selection. They take every precaution to ensure that your package is delivered in a stealthy, timely, secure manner. These vendors have been in the seed business for many years and have successfully shipped countless packages to many satisfied customers worldwide. You can find them recommended on many review sites. Discreet packaging and efficient customer service guarantees these companies will continue to thrive for many years to come.

Storing Seeds 

Typically, marijuana seeds produced by a female plant will be good for about two years. If kept in a cool, dark place(the ideal storing location) the seeds may be good for even up to 5 years!  
Many growers favor storing seeds in a cold environment for optimal germination rates. Since a seed is a living thing, when it is placed in a cold environment its life cycle slows down. This slows the seeds natural degradation significantly, meaning seeds stored in cold environments last longer. The favored seed storing method among many commercial growers is to get a black film canister(blocks out the light) and place a small amount of either uncooked rice or loose/bagged silica crystals in the bottom. These desiccants soak up any surrounding moisture and humidity. Put them in either your fridge or freezer. 
Note: You can also use specifically designed seed envelopes sold at most grow shops or online.  
Make sure to label the container/envelopes with strain, quantity and date received to make sorting easier.  
Remember when storing seeds that incorrect moisture(humidity), temperature, and light levels are the number one enemies. 
Many growers agree - temperature and humidity are the most important factors affecting seed quality during storage(humidity being the more important of these). Marijuana seeds absorb moisture from wet atmospheres and dry out when placed in dry atmospheres. Seed storage life is doubled for each 1% decrease in moisture content. The problems of maintaining seed germination

45 
increase with seed moisture content. 
Seed moisture above: 
• 40-60% - germination occurs. 
• 18-20% - heating may occur. 
• 12-14% - fungi grown on and in seed. 
• 8-9% - insects become active and reproduce. 
Heating is caused by the natural respiration of cannabis seeds, of fungi and bacteria in and on the seed which may build up rapidly in a moist 
environment. High moisture levels and high temperature will kill cannabis seeds as quickly as and invasion of microorganisms and insects.  
Stored seed life is doubled for each 41°F(5°C) reduction in storage environment temperature. 
Refrigeration to at least 41°F(5°C) is recommended(yes, this is slightly warmer than regular fridges). The cooler the temperature the more slowly seed vitality declines. This rule apparently continues to apply even at temperatures below freezing. At 41°F(5°C) and below, insects become inactive. Ever see someone freeze a fly and then blow warm air on it to heat it up(“revive” it) and then it flies away? A pretty cool magic trick if ya' ask me. 
If the above storing conditions are met, storing cannabis for five years with high germination success rates is entirely do-able. 


47 
Cannabis 

Cannabis plants begin as tiny little sprouts and eventually, toward the end of their flowering cycle, they fill out into a Christmas tree-like shape. There are primarily three parts to a cannabis plant. The top cola, the mid-section, and the base. The top cola is where a lot of the bud is grown and flowered. The mid section contains some bud, stems, and a lot of leaves. The buds in the mid section tend to be smaller than top cola buds, but the potency remains the same caliber. The bottom part of your cannabis plant well contain large fan leaves and a very tiny amount of bud. 

48 
Parts of the Plant 
There are many parts that make up a cannabis plant. The entire crop contains the psychoactive ingredients which include Delta-9 THC and various other 
cannabinoids that give each plant its own unique profile of properties and 
effects. However, not all parts contain them in the same concentrations. 

Flowers: The flowers or Buds of the plant contain the highest concentrations of plant resin which in turn contains the highest concentration of active 
ingredients. The unpollinated flowers of the female plants are the part of the plant that is used by recreational users because they produce copious amounts of potent plant resin in order to try to catch pollen from a male plant. 

49 

Marijuana is one of the few plants today that actually is split by gender and has distinct separate male and female plants. Female plants do not pollinate 
themselves in the absence of males but do contain the genetic capability to produce male flowers and may do so under stress. There are also 
hermaphrodite plants that produce both male and female flowers. Male plants and male flowers are not very potent and are generally not used for recreational purposes.

50 
Leaves: When leaves are smoked they provide a headache rather than get you high. There are however ways to extract the active ingredients from leaves and the different types of leaves have different potency levels. 
Large Shade Leaves: These are the large classically shaped leaves on the plant and are the least potent. There are extraction methods that can be 
performed to get something useful out of these but the result won't be very pure and many growers just throw them away. 
Grow Tips: These clusters of small tender leaves are the point on the plant where new growth sprouts from during vegetation. They are more potent than shade leaves but less potent than trim leaves or bud. 
Trim Leaves: These are the sugar coated leaves that are trimmed from around the buds during harvest. The sugar coating of trichomes can make these quite potent and they can be as potent as low quality flowers with seeds. 
Stems: The stems are not really useful for psychoactive purposes but they are a great source of plant fiber for rope, paper, durable clothing, etc.


51 
Seeds: The seeds generally contain only trace amounts of psychoactive 
ingredients but they are one of the most nutritious foods currently known to man. They are one of only a handful of substances that man can sustain off indefinitely with no other food and provide a complete amino acid profile. 

Trichomes: Trichomes are the oil glands of the plant and contain the highest concentration of active ingredients of any part of the plant. The flowers are sought out because they contain the highest concentration of trichomes. Hash is made from collected and pressed trichomes. Trichomes are very useful for 
determining the maturity of a plant during the flowering stage. 

Roots: Roots serve the plant through nutrient uptake. They have no 
psychoactive ingredients and aren't typically eaten.

52 
Sexing 
Sexing is an important aspect of the overall growing process for marijuana; cannabis plants normally come in two sexes, male or female. Each sex has its own very distinct flowers. The female flowers are more potent then the male flowers. Growers typically remove and destroy the males from their garden because of their very low levels of cannabinoids such as THC and CBD. Both male and female plants can turn into hermaphrodites. 

The reason you will want to sex your plants right away is so that you can 
identify and remove males - it is the flowers of the female that you will want to cultivate if you are interested in psychoactive effects. Without chemical 
extractions the flower of the female is the only part of the plant that is can be used for medicinal and recreational use. 

53 
A female plant that is not pollinated will direct the bulk of its energy later in its growth phase into developing the flower buds and swelling them with the resin that carries the bulk of marijuana's potency. The plant does this so that the large sticky flowers are more likely to catch pollen.  

If the flower is pollinated it will instead direct the bulk of its energy to seed production. This is where low quality dirt weed comes from. If you have seedy pot, it is dirt weed. The more seeds contained in the pot the lower the quality. Seeds add dramatically to the weight(they weigh more than the bud itself), this is contrasted with stems that are mostly water weight and have a negligible weight compared to the actual bud.  
Plants generally should demonstrate their sex one to two weeks into flowering. During the first ten days of flowering there is very little need for concern about males pollinating your crop. Additionally, if you reproduce by cloning you will only have to worry about males once.

54 
Pre-Flowers 
Preflowers, as opposed to full blown flowers, generally appear after the fourth week of vegetative growth from seed. Pre-flowering typically lasts about 1-2 weeks. Pre-flowering is the stage in which your plant begins to fill out nicely and its sex becomes apparent. At the start of your plant's growth you will not know whether your plant is male or female. At this time new growth regions begin to appear and change shape depending on your plant's sex, which then becomes obvious to the grower.  

Pre-flowering begins when your plant's height stops growing. Also, looking 
closely at your plant reveals small new growths are beginning to form at the nodes between the stem and the branches. Check carefully above the fourth node. These small new growths will become leaves, branches and flowers!  
Note: Preflowers are very small and and almost impossible to differentiate 
without magnification. A photographer's 10x loupe or a magnification lens is handy when examining preflowers.  
Many times preflowers will appear at the fourth or fifth node, whereas the plant is on the 7th or 8th node. These preflowers usually don't develop into full 
flowers, but are only an indicator of the plants sex. 

55 
Pre-flowering is the stage when you cross your fingers for as many females as possible. It is early in this stage that you can make an accurate guess about your plant's sex. 
If you plan to move any male plants out of your garden, you will do it a week or two into this phase. A male plant will produce little balls that are clustered 
together(much like grapes). The male plant produces these pollen sacks that, when the time is just right, will burst and spread pollen to the female plants. A female plant produces little milky white pistils that look like hairs in a pod. These hairs(pistils) will begin to curl slightly and grow longer and thicker. These hairs are also very sticky, but do not touch them as they contain your much valued THC! The hairs also will begin to cover in resin during the Flowering period(this is for catching the male's falling pollen). If the female is not pollinated then she will feel unloved and begin to produce and grow even MORE sticky THC-rich areas all over her flowers... hence the resulting development of a Sinsemilla crop, which means higher quality frosty incredible buds! 
Male or Female? 
So marijuana seeds grow into cannabis plants that are either male or female, but how can you tell? 
Male: Males can be identified by looking at the inter-nodes where leaf and branch stems connect with the main stalk. Males are often, but not always, tall with stout stems, sporadic branching, and few leaves. When a male enters the stage of flower development, the tips of the branches where a bud would 
develop will start to grow what looks like a little bud(little balls) but it will have no white hairs coming out of it.  
Male flowers will contain balls somewhere between the size of a marijuana seed and a popcorn seed. One ball is not definitive since female pistils sometimes split from a small single ball that opens. But two or three balls in a cluster is sure confirmation that you have a male. Males should be removed and 
destroyed to prevent them from releasing pollen into your garden. The pollen transports easily so the males can not be safely grown anywhere that shares an a/c or ventilation system unless special precautions are taken beforehand.

56 
The male preflower may be described as a "ball on a stick." However, its most recognizable feature is its absence of pistils. Sometimes, a male plant will 
develop mature staminate flowers after prolonged periods of vegetative growth. These appear in clusters around the nodes.  
The following image shows a male plant in early flowering. Staminate flowers are located at the node between the stipule and emerging branch.

57 
The male plant will have balls of pollen which in nature produce pollen and showers & pollinates the receptive hairs of the female plant, which once 
pollinated will produce seeds. If the female plant isn't pollinated(by keeping the male plants away), she becomes very annoyed and will begin to continuously produce thousands and thousands of hairs in the hope to catch male pollen. So the flowers/buds will continue to grow, develop, and produce lots of rich THC.  
Note: Female plants that are pollinated will use life energy for producing seeds instead of THC. This results in lower potency marijuana, and high seed yields. Male plants in general will be less potent and produce less THC than a female plant.

Female: Female plants produce tear-drop shaped balls called “calyxes” at the nodes between leaf and stem. Each sprouting two white hairs or, “pistils.” 
Another identifier is that the female plant's leaves will grow closer together forming a strong stem which will hold the clusters of flowers and later the 
ripening seed. Females will have no balls and will have small white hairs.  
As the images below demonstrate, the female preflower is pear shaped and produces a pair of pistils. Frequently, the female preflowers do not show pistils until well after the preflowers have emerged. Thus, don't yank a plant because it has no pistils. Pistillate preflowers are located at the node between the stipule and emerging branch.  
Also, some female preflowers never produce pistils. A female preflower without pistils is difficult to distinguish from a male preflower. Thus, hermaphodite issues should not be resolved by the appearance of preflowers, without pistils, on a plant otherwise believed to be a female.

Hermaphrodite 
A hermaphrodite, or “hermie”, is a plant of one sex that develops the sexual organs of the other sex. Most commonly, a flowering female plant will develop staminate flowers, though the reverse is also true. Primarily male 
hermaphrodites are not as well recognized only because few growers let their males reach a point of flowering where the pistillate would be expressed.  

Hermaphrodites are generally viewed with disfavor. First, they will release pollen and ruin a sinsemellia crop, pollinating themselves and all of the other females in the room. Second, the resulting seeds are worthless, because hermaphrodite parents tend to pass on the genetic tendency to their offspring.  
Note: Occasionally specious staminate flowers will appear in the last days of flowering of a female plant. These do not drop pollen and their appearance is not considered evidence of hermaphroditism.

Methods to Determine Sex 
If your plant didn’t show any pre-flowers or they showed preflowers but  
you want to be really sure what sex your plants have, you will have to wait for the real flowers to mature. Indica tends to flower earlier then  
Sativa dominant strains. By looking at the flowers and identifying males or 
females you find out the sex of the plant. Remember if the plant has both males and females flowers it’s a dreaded hermaphrodite. 
It is possible to induce flowering in plants with 12/12, identify the males,  
then to re-veg by going to 24 hr. light. The males will show their sex  
within 2 weeks of 12/12. They will then revert to vegetating after a couple weeks of 24 hrs. However sending back plants into the vegetative  
phase cause unnecessary stress and stretch. Therefore it better to force  
flowering on clones. Since you are only interested in the sex and not in the  yield of the clone almost any type of lamp will do. Also if you are  
flowering clones just to figure out the sex, you do not have to root the 
clone, you can just let it stay in a glass of water.  
If you are flowering clones just to check the sex you can increase the  
period of darkness. This will speed up the flowering process – however  
it will also decrease the yield so it’s not a method to use if you’re  
seriously interested in the yield. 
Determining Plant Sex 
Plant Height + Pre-Flower Timing: If your using the same seed strains with all your plants, it can be a safe assumption to make that the taller plants are males and the shorter plants are females. Also note that male plants tend to begin pre-flowering much earlier than female plants.  
Calyx Method: Another method is to take a magnifying glass or microscope to the plant's calyx. If the calyx is raised on a stem then it is most likely a male plant. If the calyx is NOT raised on a stem then it is probably a female plant.

64 
Forcing Cloning: This method is a 100% accurate way of determining your plant's sex. Begin by taking a cutting(two is best, just in case one dies), from each parent plant whose sex is unknown. It is advisable to somehow place a 
label or piece of colored tape on the cuttings to identify sets of clones from their corresponding parents. Next give your rooting clones a 12-hour light/dark 
photoperiod. After a 12-hour day, place the clones in a completely dark area (such as placing a box over them). This will induce flowering. Clones typically tend to show their sex within two weeks.  

Paper Bag Method: This is an easy one. To do this, take a piece of a black plastic garbage bag and be secure it to the end of a branch using twist ties. Apply the bag so that the branch receives 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness(i.e. on at 6 P.M. off at 6 A.M.). Within three weeks you will see the male plants will have what look like little balls forming on the branch. The 
females will have two tiny white hairs emerging from an immature calyx. The males can now be removed and you are guaranteed a crop of all females. 
Remove the plastic from the branch of the female and she will begin growing again.

65 
Cull out all the males(unless you are using them for breeding purposes). Keep the mother growing in vegetative mode under 18-24 hours of light. 
Stages of Growth 
As with most plants in nature, marijuana goes through several distinct phases of growth. It is an annual plant and completes its life cycle in one full season. A seed that is planted in the spring will grow vigorously through the summer and flower in the fall, producing more seeds. The new seeds will sprout the next year, continuing the annual process. The three basic stages of development are Seedling(also called “germination” or “pre-vegetative”), Vegetative, and lastly Flowering(or “budding”). 

66 
Marijuana Grows In Stages 
The order is as follows: 
Germination -> Seedling -> Vegetative -> Pre-Flowering -> Flowering 
Germination 
This is what will need to happen to your seeds to get your plant started! During germination moisture, heat, and air activate hormones within the durable outer coating of the seeds. Soon, the seeds outer protective coating will crack and the root(a tiny white sprout) is pushed downward outside. Next seed leaves emerge 
out from within the shell as they search upward in search of light. Soon after a seedling is formed.  

Seedling Phase 
After 3-8 days of germination, plants will enter into their seedling phase of growth that lasts about a month. First a seed that has been germinated and sprouted a root, or a clone, is placed in the hydroponic garden(or soil container) and given food(nutrients) and lighting. After this, the plant will form its' root system, stem and a couple leaves. Typically during this seedling phase time the plants are given 16-18 hours of light each day to ensure strong healthy growth. The seedling growth stage lasts for about two to three weeks after seeds have germinated.

67 
Vegetative Growth 
After seedlings have established a strong root system and foliage growth 
increases rapidly, your plants enter what is known as the vegetative growth phase. This begins the moment a seedling or clone takes root and ends as soon as the plant is ready to mature and produce buds.  

During this phase of growth your plant will begin to quickly develop and begin growing thick branches, stems, and start producing leaves. As long as plenty of sufficient light, nutrients, CO2, water and other optimal environmental 
conditions are met you can expect your plant to grow from ½ – 2 inches per day! This is also the stage in which the plant's root system strengthens and matures. The stem also grows thicker. It's cool to see your plant begin to look like a real marijuana plant! This is the stage where this happens. Effects you will observe is a thicker stem & branches, and more fingers forming on the leaves. 

68 
A very key biological process known as Photosynthesis will begin to occur during the Vegetative Growth Phase. This begins once the leaves grow and expand. Chlorophyll converts CO2 from the air, light energy, and water into carbohydrate food and oxygen. In order for this process to occur, leaves must be kept moist. Stomata(tiny breathing pores located on the underside of the leaf) open and close to regulate moisture preventing dehydration. The stomata also allows waste and water flow to flow outwards. Keep your plant's stomata clean! This means no dust or nasty buildup, your plant's need to breath in order to 
maximize photosynthesis and other critical growth enhancing processes.  

During vegetative growth the plant will be photosynthesizing as much as 
possible to grow tall and start many grow tips at each pair of leaves. A grow tip is the part that can be cloned or propagated asexually. They are located at the top of the plant, and at ever major internode. If you “top” the plant, then it has two grow tips at the top. If you top each of these, you will have 4 grow tips at the top of the plant(since it takes time for the plant to heal and recover from the trauma of being pruned, it is faster to grow 4 smaller plants and not top them at all. Or grow 2 plants, and “train” them to fill the same space). 
The key to a strong vigorous vegetative growth phase that will reap a heavy,
