In Memoriam:

Dedication

Steven McWilliams

This book is dedicated to Sebastain Orfali;
Roger Watanabe; my mother, father, wife and
family; all cannabis medical patients; and all
the people who have suffered the effects of
the War on (prohibited cannabis) Drugs. We
share a common affliction. Some law enforcement and political agents have shared our
pain; others are in different stages of denial.
May the Christian God, Buddah, Alai, Sheeba,
and the God you worship, bless you all.

Scared of possible jail time, in constant pain
and tired of battling for medical marijuana
patients' rights, Steven McWilliams committed
suicide in San Diego on Monday July II, 2005
on his 51st birthday.
Mr. McWilliams was famous nation-wide for
his efforts and the legitimacy he lent to the medical marijuana movement Not taken seriously at
first, McWilliams did not give up, working for the
movement since as early as 1996 when
California state voters approved Proposition
21 5, allowing patients to use marijuana for
medical purposes when prescribed by a doctor.
Steven McWilliams worked to implement
Proposition 215 locally in San Diego. Showing
up weekly for City Council meetings carrying a
marijuana plant, he urged the local politicians to
come up with a plan for the distribution of mar·
ijuana. As a result the city came up with standards for the number of plants allowed by users.
Mr. McWilliams served on a city-organized committee for a time that dealt with these issues. He
ran for city council a few times, when he wasn't
alternately suing the city.
In spite of all this, he was convicted in 2003 for
illegal cultivation, and sentenced to a six-month
federal prison term. Still out on appeal at the
time of his suicide, he was in chronic and serious pain, the judge had ordered that he not use
marijuana. Mr. McWilliams suffered severe side

effects from the use of standard prescription
painkillers. He left a note saying that the pain
was too much to bear, and he hoped his suicide
would help change the government's position
towards marijuana as a medicine.
Memorial services were held in San Diego at
City Hall, white roses were passed to the attendees.
Steph Sherer, executive director of Americans
for Safe Access said, "Steve McWilliams was tortured by the federal government because of the
medication he needed."

.. •
The Native Suns Dispensary opened in San Diego on June 6, 2005, in defiance of the Supreme Court's ruling
agoinst individuol states' medical marijuanolaws. In " 6·3 split-decision, Justice Paul Stevens soid that congress
has a moral responsibility to change the nation's laws regarding cannabis use for medical patients. In writing
the decision Justice Stevens did find that the federal government did not exceed its authority under law when
federal officers raided medical marijuana patients with California state prescriptions.

The War on Drugs
The War on Drugs in "Ameri ca, Land of the
Free" is out of control. This War on American citizens and many other unfortunate souls around
the world continues to be driven by fear and
misinformation that is spun by numerous US
and foreign government agencies.
The War on Drugs concentrates on encarcerating cannabis users and is headed by a drug a ar.
Czar is defined by Webster's Dictionary, as I . A
former Russian emporeror. 2. An autocrat. 3.
Informal. One in authority: Leader. From these
definitioins we know that a Drug Czar is not one
to listen to any opposition. Is this the basis of
democracy?
The most infamous American Drug Czars
include: William Bennet (a tobacco smoker,
alcohol drinker and compulsive gambler)
General Barry McCaffrey (the most decorated
US General and instigator of failed "anticannabis media propaganda"), and John Walters
(a career bureaucrat who labels peaceful
cannabis consumers as terrori sts). All past and
present Drug Czars profess "high moral standards."
Many official Government and private reports
have recommended legalization or decriminalization of cannabis including:
1928: Le Dain Commission (Canada) recommended to decriminalize or legalize small
amounts of marijuana.
1972: the Safer Commission, appointed by
President Nixon, reported that laws regarding
marijuana should be decriminalized. Nixon
rejected that recommendation, and instead
endorsed the creation of the US Drug
Enforcement Agency (DEA).
1990: California Advisory Panel (appointed by
the State of California) recommended that
California legalize marijuana. State Attorney
General John Van de l<amp refused to publish
the report.
2005: The Budgetary Implications of Marijuana
Prohibition report is released. The Harvard
University report by 500 US economists head7d
by economist Milton Friedman endorses legalizing and taxing cannabis.
v :. -· :t;_W

Cannabis has been used medicinally for more
than 10,000 years. Cannabis is being legally dispensed medicinally in I 0 US states, Canada, the
Netherlands and Spain. Still the US Government
classifies cannabis as a Schedule I drug along
with heroin as having no medical value.
The July 30, 2004 editon of the Seattle Times
reported "Marijuana smuggling case first loc~l
use of Patriot Act provision. The US attorney 111
Seattle, WA charged 15 people in a marijuana
smuggling operation. n, e undercover snitch, a
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
agent, posed as a middle man who actually
smuggled money from the US to Canada.
The alleged cannabis and money smugglers
were charged under the Patriot Act. The Patriot
Act was passed into law in the US in order to
thwart international terrorism after the
September 11 attacl<s on the World Trade ~enter
towers in New York City. However accord1ng to
US attorney Todd Greenberg in Seatt le, "there is
no indication these defendants are connected to
terrorism."

88.6 percent of arrests in 2001 were for possession only.
With ever increasing prohibition we are growing more cannabis around the world than ever
before. Most of the photographs and much of
the information was collected outside of the
USA. The cannabis laws in the "Land of the Free"
are some of the most horrifying and repressive

in the world. However, with the artificial
"cannabis price support program in a free market" spawned by the US government, the rest of
the world is benefiting. Growers from all over
the world, including the ones that are willing to
risk their freedom and assets in the USA, are
able to cash in on this defacto program.
Here is how the program works. Cannabis is
illegal. This creates an artificially high price for
cannabis because the supply is limited and the
demand high. Aggressive entrepreneurs see the
opportunity and fill t~e need in the marketplace.
When harsh laws are enforced, entrepreneurs
give way to thugs and organized crime who fill
the orders for cannabis. Any first year economics
student can figure this out!
This information has caught the eye of a few
politicians. A growing number of politicians are
finding the integrity and moxie required to risk
"political suicide" and endorse medical
cannabis.

Indoor Marijuana
Horticulture Second Edition

:

JMN Secane/ Edition Revised

The "Bible" has gone through a complete metamorphosis since the
first edition in 1983. The First Edition was just 96 pages, black and
white and bound with a pair of staples. I wrote the book on a l<aypro
II computer. To typeset I hooked my l<aypro to a VAX mainframe
computer. The typeset "galleys" were pasted up into "hard copy." I
printed the book on a Multilith press. My wife and I collated pages
and stapled them together to form the first Indoor Marijuana
Horticulture book. The book immediately became a best seller
among indoor growers and has rem ained on top ever since!
The Second Edition (1 985) grew to 288 pages and was christened
"The Bible" by indoor growers. The Third Edition (1993) grew to 320
pages and the Fourth Edition (2001 ) tipped the scales at 432 pages
and contained 200 color photos and drawings. The Bible is published
in Dutch, German, French, English, and Spanish. There is also a special Ul< Edition. The Australian Edition was banned by the Australian
Government, but lofty Auzzies still find ways to bring in the Bible.
The Bible now has a little larger format (6 x 8.25 inches (150 x 210
em]), 512 pages and is full color throughout with more than 1100 full
color photographs, drawings, charts, and graphs. The Fifth Edition is
completely rewritten to reflect the changes in cannabis cultivation in
recent years. Sections on seeds, seedlings, vegetative growth,
cloning, flowering, breeding and hash have been amplified substantially. All new sections have been added on greenhouses and outdoor growing. Photos and precise color drawings augment text to
simplify information so that it is easier to assimilate.
Digital cameras, fast computers with big hard disks and fast Internet
connections have transformed the Bible into a much more complete
work.
We were able to hold the price at $21 .95 from 1993 until 2005, 12
years. The expense of adding color to each and every page, hiring
editors, travel, office overhead, and inflation have made it necessary
to sell a minimum of advertising as well as increase the price to
$24.95.
If you would like to learn more about advertising in the Bible,
please hit our website:•www.mruijyanagrowjng.com .
Case studies follow the text They show exactly how different growers grew super smoke for pennies a day. All of their growing statistics- watts, varieties, calendar, cost, harvest weight, etc. - are also listed. See how growers invest a minimum of cash and harvest pound
after pound of outstanding bud 365 days a year!
A garden "Calendar" and "Checklist" in the book lend additional
organization for all indoor horticulturists.

Grow Info FREE!
Information and velocity at which it travels is
the most important new innovation in marijuana growing during the last five years.
The Internet allows millions of growers all over
the world to share information. US growers can
still ask and answer anonymous grow questions
on line and download information about
cannabis use. Here is a short list of some of my
favorite web sites.

century. Government geeks and spooks developed the World Wide Web for national security reasons.

Smart growers, especially from countries with draconian laws, do not e-mail about growing or surf
grow sites on a computer located in a grow house. Remember, a person never knows who is peeking at transparent e-mail. "Firewall" software alerts and protects the user against another party tracking a surfing path or to unauthorized entry into their computer. Ask at your local software store for

can post "facts" to their site or news group.
Many times unverified, poorly researched "facts"
are either self-serving or untrue. Always ask
yourself if the information you are reading
makes sense. If it sounds too good to be true, it
probably is. I often surf through many sites and

Marijuana Chemistry
Cannabis is the only plant that produces chemicals called cannabinoids. However, with gene
splicing and genetic engineering, it is only a matter of time ·until cannabinoids are added to
other plants. Cannabinoids are ingredients
unique to cannabis; the psychoactive cannabinoids are responsible for the mind-bending
effects of marijuana. Some cannabinoids get
you high. Around 40 cannabinoids have been
confirmed to exist, but most are not psychoactive. Here is a short rundown on the six most
prominent cannabinoids.

t,9 THC, the main ingredient that gets you high,

is called: .!.\9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol. All
cannabis, whether industrial hemp or drug marijuana, contains some 1::.9 THC. Industrial hemp
cannabis contains infinitesimal amounts while
dried flower tops (buds) of potent marijuana
can contain up to 25 percent t:.9 THC. In potent
varieties of marijuana, perhaps all of the mindbending effects are derived from t::.9 THC.
t,O THC is found in very low concentrations in
cannabis. It also gets you high, but there is so little e:.o THC in most cannabis that researchers,
breeders, and growers concentrate on the more
abundant and potent t.-9 THC. To simplify matters we will refer to both t:.9 THC and .!.\6 THC as
THC.
Cannabidiol, known as CBD, also appears in
virtually all varieties of cannabis. The amount of
<;BD varies enormously, from a trace to more
than 95 percent of all cannabinoids present in a
plant. CBD generally has a sedative effect
regarding the high you experience. CBD, when
combined with THC, tends to postpone the
beginning of the high, but the good part is that
CBD can make it last twice as long. Whether
CBD increases or decreases the force of the high
is subjective and must be discerned by each
smoker.

receptors and neurotransmitters. Some terpenoids act as serotonin uptake inhibitors (as
does Prozac(nl), and augment the neurotransmitter GABA (as does Valium). Terpenoids produce anti-inflammatory effects in the respiratory
tract. Their presence in marijuana smoke may
explain why inhaling marijuana smoke causes
less airway irritation and inflammation than
inhaling pure THC. Limonene blocks the carcinogenesis induced by "tar" generated from the
combustion of herb. limonene is currently
undergoing tests for the treatment of several
types of cancer. Terpenoids rock.
Dr. Ethan Russo described "endocannabinoid
deficiency syndrome," and suggested that the
administration of THC and CBD corrected for
deficiencies of either anandamide or CB receptors. The administration of TI-IC and CBD seems
to kick-start our endocannabinoid system. For
example, THC stimulates the release of anandamide, and CBD inhibits the breakdown of
anandamide. One study has shown that acute
administration of THC may increase the density
of CB receptors in the central nervous system.
Tolerance and addiction to marijuana is uncommon, in part, because THC is a "partial agonist."
Agonists are compounds that stimulate receptors, and partial agonists can only partially activate receptors. Perhaps the best medicines are
partial agonists- they steer us away from disease, but our innate healing mechanisms are
still required to restore us to complete health.
We recall the sheep farmer analogy: when the
farmer finds a sheep on the wrong side of the
fence, the farmer corrects the situation by placing the sheep on the other side of the fence, not
by carrying the sheep over the fence and all the
way to the center of the pasture.
In conclusion, marijuana as medicine is
becoming accepted around the world, even
among scientists and physicians. Professor John
Graham was not far off when he predicted in
1976, "The drug has been frowned upon, officially banned, but the interest of the medical
profession is slowly reviving. It is not impossible

that a limited but respectable niche will be
established for it in therapeutics by the end of
the century" (Marijuana and Health, by J. D. P.
Graham, Academic Press, 1976).

Cannabinol. or CBN, is produced as THC oxidizes or degrades. Only a trace of CBN exists in
fresh bud. Stored and cured tops or hashish
have higher levels of CBN, that has converted
from Tl-lC. Marijuana with high levels of CBN
generally makes the toker feel disoriented, often
sleepy or groggy, referred to as a stupefying
high. At best, CBN contains only 10 percent of
the psychoactive potency of the original THC.
Tetrahydrocannabivarin, called THCV, is the
shorter three-carbon propyl that replaces the
five-carbon pentyl chain. This compound is assodated with the fragrance of the plant. In other
words, very pungent smelling marijuana normally contains THCV. Warmer temperatures
bring out more smell. THCV is found in very
potent marijuana that originates in Southeast
and Central Asia as well as regions in Africa.
Concentrations of THCV usually make the high
come on quicker and disappear sooner. There is
still much research to do on this cannabinoid.

.

Cannabis (marijuana, hashish) has long been
used for recreational and medicinal purposesfor 10,000 years or more. Its medical indications
are manifold, including glaucoma, muscle spasticity (e.g., multiple sclerosis), movement disorders (e.g., Huntington's disease), and a variety of
pain syndromes. Marijuana reduces nausea and
vomiting and enhances appetite, so it helps
people with AIDS and opposes the side effects
of cancer chemotherapy. Research shows it can
prevent the death of injured neurons. And everyone knows it alleviates anxiety and depression.
Marijuana research is one of the fastest-moving fields of medical science, so any books we
suggest may soon be outdated. In the 2000 edition of Indoor Marijuana Horticulture, we recommended the book Marijuana and Medicine
(National Academy Press, 1999). This classic
book has been updated by Cannabis and
Cannabinoids (Haworth Press, 2002) and The
Medicinal Uses of Cannabis and Cannabinoids
(Pharmaceutical Press, 2004). Marijuana
Medicine by Christian Ratsch (Healing Arts
Press, 1998) is a beautiful book that focuses on
ethnobotany and the historical uses of cannabis.

· Despite marijuana's unambiguous medical
benefits, the USA Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) classifies marijuana as a
prohibited Schedule 1 drug ("no currently
accepted medical use"). However, tetrahydrocannabinol (THt), the primary active ingredient
in marijuana, is classified as a synthetic
Schedule Ill drug (dronabinol, Marino!®). TI1e
DEA's hypocritical classification is rejected by

many Americans. Currently ten states in the USA
allow patients to possess marijuana for medical
use, contingent upon a physician's recommendation, but possession remains illegal under
Federal law.
Because marijuana remains illegal under
Federal law, its source remains the black market.
Patients must obtain their medicine from unregulated producers. You, dear reader, may be one
such unregulated producer. Patients depend
upon your ethics and expertise to supply them
with high-quality medicine, free from contaminants. Jorge and I reckon that dishonorable laws
create honor among outlaws, so we entreat all
growers to supply only the best organically
grown marijuana. The methods for cultivating
pharmaceutical-grade herb are outlined in this
book. Grow the healthiest plants possible, by
paying careful attention to the basics: light, nutrients, water, and air. Everything must be in balance, especially nutrients. If you get the balance
right, you won't need to read the chapters on
insect and mold control. The most common
contaminant'S of marijuana are molds or pesticides. Optimal cultivation eliminates the possibility of these contaminants.
Of course, optimal cultivation may sometimes
elude even the best grower. This book details
the use of natural pesticides such as oils and
soaps. Better yet, this book promotes the use of
biocontrols-cornmercially available organisms
that combat pests and diseases (ladybugs versus aphids being a classic example). For more
information regarding the use of natural pesticides and biocontrols, consult the "bible," Hemp
Diseases and Pests (see sidebar). Despite all
this great information, we still preach the bottorn line: "An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure." Even "natural" chemicals may
cause problems in some people. The latest edition of O'Shaughnessy's details the case of a
woman who fell ill while manicuring marijuana
that had been sprayed with abamectin.
Abamectin is a natural compound produced by
a soil bacterium. It is approved for use in organic gardens, but, nevertheless, it nearly killed the

woman. Grow well and avoid chemicals.
So how does marijuana work as medicine?
The question is a proverbial onion, with many
layers to peel before we get to the core. The first
layer is the medicine's herbal essence, which is
at odds with current medical science. The DEA
and FDA criticize the use of herbs as medicines,
saying plants contain a variable mix of compounds and cannot provide a precisely defined
drug effect. According to the pharmaceutical
industry, medicines are synthetic, single-ingredient "silver bullets" that focus upon solitary meta·
bolic pathways in our physiological systems.
Herbalists, on the other hand, applaud the
polypharmacy of herbal remedies, and claim
two advantages over single-ingredient drugs:
1. The many constituents in herbs may work
by multiple mechanisms to improve therapeutic
activity in a cumulative or synergistic manner.

2. Herbs may also contain compounds that
mitigate the side effects of their predominant
active ingredients.
Thus, marijuana has been characterized as a
"synergistic shotgun," in contrast with synthetic,
single-ingredient "silver bullets." The many
ingredients in marijuana modulate our health
via several metabolic pathways, gently nudging
our system towards homeostasis. According to
the pharmaceutical industry, This kind of "multitasking" makes marijuana impossible to evaluate, according to the pharmaceutical industry.
But multi-tasking avoids the unbalanced distortion of solitary metabolic pathways, as produced
by synthetic, single-ingredient silver bullets such
as Vioxx.
First and foremost in marijuana's list of ingredients is THC. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a
"new" molecule, produced by cannabis, which
evolved within the past 34 million years. Many
botanists speculate that THC initially evolved as
a toxin to deter herbivores. But this evolutionary
strategy was diverted when THC became attractive to humans- the "botany of desire" described
by Michael Pollan. THC works in humans by
mimicking an endogenous compound that our
own bodies make, called anandamide. THC
binds to anandamide's receptors, called
cannabinoid (CB) receptors. Research indicates
that CB receptors originally evolved in primitive
organisms about 600 million years ago!
However, as with all chicken-and-egg questions,
the story of CB receptors and cannabis began
long before the current pair of protagonists
appeared in evolutionary time. It is probable
that both CB receptors and cannabis had evolutionary predecessors. They may date to "deep
time," before plants and animals diverged in the
primordial soup. Over many eons, CB receptors
may have become "vestigial," analogous to an
appendix, only to be reactivated when Homo
sapiens discovered cannabis. Humans have
interacted and coevolved with cannabis for millennia, creating a complex heterogenous medicine by selecting plants that provide maximal

benefits and minimal side effects. The success of
10,000 or more years of human refinement with
this botanical medication will be difficult to
replicate in modern laboratories. This deconstruction of pharmacological theory is radical,
and may herald the re-introduction of herbal
medicines into modern medical pharmacopeias,
with marijuana leading the way.
When THC or anandamide activate CB receptors, the CB receptors activate G-proteins. G-proteins are microscopic messengers that migrate
around cells and modulate a variety of ion channels and enzymes. Cannabinoid receptors associate with different subtypes of G-proteins, such
as Gi and Gs subtypes. The "i" and "s" abbreviate "inhibitor" and "stimulator," which describe
the opposite effects these G-proteins have on
their targets. Research has shown that different
cannabinoids preferentially activate different
subtypes of G-proteins. This may explain why
different strains of marijuana produce different
highs. For example, Afghani plants produce a lot
of cannabidiol (CBD), and perhaps CBD preferentially activates Gi and causes an inhibitory,
stony, narcotic-like effect. Whereas plants from
Thailand contain tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV,
a propyl analogue of THC) that might preferentially activate Gs and cause that speedy, buzzy,
Thai high.
Thanks to its mix of ingredients, marijuana
causes fewer psychological side effects (such as
anxiety and panic reactions) than pure, synthetic THC (Marino!). Clinical trials have shown that
CBD reduces the anxiety provoked by THC, and
CBD demonstrates antipsychotic effects. Anxiety
from THC may also be alleviated by terpenoids
present in marijuana. Many terpenoids are
volatile and possess sedative properties when
inhaled, including limonene, linalool, citronellol,
and terpineol. Terpenoids may also mitigate
memory loss caused by pure THC. Limonene,
terpinene, carvacrol, and pulegone increase
brain acetylcholine activity. This mechanism is
shared by tacrine, a drug used for the treatment
of Alzheimer's disease. Terpenoids act on other

Safety and Security!
Unfortunately we must include a security
chapter in this book. You must keep your crop
secure from police and thieves alike. Ironically,
the police will cause you more problems than
thieves!
Successful indoor growers are good citizens
and keep a low profile. lney keep the yard and
home clean and in excellent repair. They always
drive a street-legal car and there are no outstanding warrants on the drivers. Remember, an
overdue traffic ticket turns into a warrant for the
violator's arrest. Smart growers pay bills on time,
are nice to neighbors, and do not throw noisy,
wild, crazy parti es.

•

Do not throw out any garbage that could prove
that you grow. Cops pick through it like rats to
find evidence to make a case against gardeners.
Growers live by the motto "loose lips sink ships."
Never have seeds or grow products sent
directly to your home.
Growers and tokers have been made into ''the
enemy" by the American government in the War
on Drugs. It is the job of law enforcement to
arrest the flower-growing enemy. To wage this
war on US citizens, law enforcement wields an
impressive arsenal, including draconian laws,
misinformation and high-tech surveillance gizmos.
The cardinal rule of growing is: Never tell anybody about any garden.
Clandestine growing is as simple as the name
implies. The name of the game is secrecy. Tell
nobody and cause no suspicion. Countless
underground growers have been harvesting
crop after crop for decades in Drug War-torn
America. lnese benevolent souls supply much
of America today.
Stay away from other grow houses, wild part·ies, real criminals, etc. Always take a friend's car
to the grow store and go seldom. Travel with
others whenever possible. Your car is easy to
trace and follow. Keep your consumption habits
reasonable; don't show large cash income. Buy
large assets, houses and cars, over time. Don't
ever tell anybody you are growing or even joke
about growing. Always have a job and a reason
for your act·ivities. Keep a low profile.
Keep your home and surrounding property in
good repair. Make sure the house is painted,
lawn mowed, and garbage picked up. Keep
electrical use to a reasonable amount, and keep
the air clean around the house. Have very few
visitors, and keep to yourself. Have minimal conversations with neighbors.
Never trust anybody- friends, family-brother,
sister, children, even your mother! In America,
"Land of the Free,'' a grower can go to jail just for
giving another grower advice! The Racketeer

Influenced and Corrupt Organizations [Act)
(RICO) conspiracy laws were enacted to break
up the Mafia. Today RICO laws are used against
growers and non-growers alike. Under the law,
a person that advises a grower to "water in the
morning" is equally guilty of growing the marijuana garden, even if he never saw the garden.
RICO laws tread on the very essence of the
American Constitution.
The new Homeland Security Act further erodes
personal rights of individuals.
Never visit or telephone other growers. If visiting another grow room, that grower can implicate you with circumstantial evidence, and you
are considered as guilty as the grower!
DO NOT use booby traps, bear traps, firearms
attached to tripwires, etc., to protect your crop
I know of people who use infrared systems
that tal<e pictures and/or start recording video
when an object of particular size/temperature
enters the vicinity.
Depending upon the country in which you live,
law enforcement must first have a search warrant to use infrared or thermo imaging devices
to secure a search warrant. But if they have a
search warrant, such high-tech snooping is perfectly legal. If you want to take a look at what
they see, rent heat-sensitive night-vision glasses

from your local military supply store, or tal<e a
photo of the outside of your grow operation
with infrared film. You can also add a filter to
your digital camera and convert the fotos with a
few clicks of Photoshop to show heat signatures.
Law enforcement has sophisticated telephone
bugging devices, super-sensitive directional
microphones, infrared scopes, thermal imaging,
etc. They can also subpoena telephone, Internet,
and electrical company records. Intimidating
cops coerce electric company employees to
break the law and give them the records of
unsuspecting consumers. Tracking telephone
numbers, including location, is very easy. There
has been more than one case where US law
enforcement illegally acquired telephone
records and placed illegal taps on garden store
telephones. American police use telephone
records to target grow houses. Always use pay
telephones with an untraceable phone card or
pay with coins. Lazy narcs also watch garden
store parking lots and follow clients home.
Pay all bills and make all purchases with cash.
Cash tells no tales and leaves no trails. Pay for
mail order merchandise wi th a money order.
Have the merchandise sent to a "safe" address.
If you want to take photos of your garden, use

.

a digital camera. Using an old-fashioned film
camera, you risk discovery when getting the film
developed.
Growers who cultivate cannabis, including
medical cannabis, should never show their grow
show to anyone! Never tell anyone you are
growing. Deny growing to everyone, always! You
immediately change from a Weed Warrior to a
helpless victim subject to extortion the instant
anybody knows you are growing in the USA.
When the cops arrest a "friend" that has seen
your grow show, they can legally use deception
and intimidation to trick your "friend" into
squealing on you. Beware! Interrogations can
last for months!
Law enforcement rewards jealous, hateful, and
vindictive "friends," lovers, and enemies for
implicating a grower under the RICO laws and
Homeland Security Act. Hundreds of thousands
of growers have had their lives ruined in a matter of moments on testimony from a vindictive
"friend."
All electrical outlets, fuses, and connections
must be grounded. Inspect electrical connections for signs of heat-blackened wires, melted
connections, and smelly wiring.
Have a current fire extinguisher rated to put
out wood, paper, grease, oil, and electrical fires.
When law enforcement has "evidence" of a
growing operation, they look for more. In the
USA they look at telephone, electric, and ship·
ping records, for starters. A thermal imaging
camera is most often used at this point.
Occasionally they use dogs trained to sniff out
marijuana. The information is used against the
grower to obtain a search warrant. If there are
plants discovered at the house, they continue to
build the case against the grower by using anything the grower says. The police collect most of
the information on the grower from the grower!
Surround your property with a bed of cedar
shavings instead of bark chips in the flowerbeds.
Cedar shavings disguise other odors. Use a carbon filter and an ozone generator to neutralize
the marijuana fragrance. Have a ready reason for

and short stature.
extra electrical consumption. Unload grow supplies a little bit at a time or from within a locked
garage.
Remember the quote from Bart Simpson: "I
didn't do it. Nobody saw me. You can't prove a
thing!"
Absentee owners are the best landlords. Make
sure home inspections are done before you
move into the home and the rental agreement
should allow for an advance notification of
inspections. Put the telephone, electricity,
garbage, etc., in a friend's name. Grow in a rented home. If you have bank accounts and stocks,
own property such as a home, automobile, ATV,
etc., in the USA, they are often forfeited if you
are "suspected" of growing. You do not need to
be convicted of any crime for your assets to be
confiscated!
Curb noise and odors by sealing and insulating
the grow room with "sound board." Similar to
sheetrock, soundboard muffles sounds well.
Install rubber feet or grommets on fan feet.
Build an extra room or box (allow for air flow)

Now, rela tively inexpensive (less than
$10,000) thermal imaging devices are becoming
more affordable for smaller police forces.
Thermal imaging devices have been used legally to measure the heat signature escaping from
structures. This invasive "evidence" is used with
other "evidence" to secure a search warrant.
According to USpolice sources, the devices are
legal only to find heat escaping from windows,
vents, etc. Most often narcs use the cameras illegally to secure a search warrant. They slither
around the neighborhood early in the morning
or under the cloak of darkness to snap the hot
shots. The law stipulates specific parameters for
the camera, and the technology is relatively
arcane. The "approved" imaging devices are
;,~ble to record differences in heat levels outside
of buildings. In the USA, it is illegal to search the
inside of a structure for the "heat signature.".
However, today there are devices that can actually "see through walls" to provide an image
based on the heat a person emits.
Avoid thermal imaging problems by turning
grow lights on during the daytime. The daytime

imaging cameras are rendered useless; the technology will not
work during the daytime. Shield and insulate walls and windows from heat loss from lamps. Store ballasts in separate
room s, and channel the heat away from the grow room. Cool
grow room air before exhausting outdoors. Air vented out
underneath a structure is nice and cool before mixing with the
outdoor environment.
Growers having problems with thermal imaging should contact NORML, 1001 Connecticut Ave. NW, suite 710, Washington,
DC 20036, Tel: 1-202-483-7205. They have an excellent study
on thermal imaging devices and legal aspects compiled by
Carlos Ghigiotti. This information could save another lawyer a
lot of time.
In June of 2001, the Supreme Court decided a case brought
against Oregon resident Danny Kyllo. The decision determined Always keep a

that the use of a thermal imaging device constitutes an illegal
search. High-tech thermal imaging devices often get as much
press as police bullying tactics. Law enforcement officials can
legally lie, cheat, and steal to acquire evidence against peaceful,
plant-loving growers. Deception is one of their biggest
weapons, and snitches their best allies. Law enforcement legalI
ly coerces terrified growers into squealing on their friends and
family. The lesson here is simple; do not tell anybody, under any
circumstances, that you are growing in the United States of
America. Growers are arrested daily on ''hearsay" evidence from
an arrested informant. Stay away from the heat.
One last bit of simple security detail: grow efficiently! Growers
in a Drug War-torn America should harvest 0.5 grams of dried
bud every month for each watt of light in the flowering room. Put rubber feet on fans and blowers to
shunt vibrations and noise.
Growers that do not harvest
this much are cheating
themselves and need to
master the basics of growing. Always grow fewer than

Introduction
The key to successful indoor cannabis cultivation is to understand how cannabis produces
food and grows. Cannabis, whether cultivated
indoors or out, has the same requirements for
growth. It needs light, air, water, nutrients, a
growing medium, and heat to manufacture food
and to grow. Without any one of these essentials, growth stops and death soon results.
Indoors, the light must be of the proper spectrum and intensity; air must be warm, arid, and
rich in carbon dioxide; water must be abundant
but not excessive, and the growing medium
must contain the proper levels of nutrients for
vigorous growth. When all these needs are met
consistently a.t optimum levels, optimum growth
is the result.
Cannabis is normally grown as an annual
plant, completing its life cycle within one year. A

seed that is planted in the spring will grow
strong and tall through the summer and flower
in the fall, producing more seeds. The annual
cycle starts all over again when the new seeds
sprout the following year. In nature, cannabis
goes through distinct growth stages. The chart
below delineates ead1 stage of growth.

Life Cycle of Cannabis
After 3-7 days of germination, plants enter the
seedling growth stage which lasts about a
month. During the first growth stage the seed
germinates or sprouts, establishes a root system,
and grows a stem and a few leaves.

Germination
During germination moisture, heat, and air activate hormones (cytokinins, gibberellins, and auxins) within the durable outer coating of the seed.
Cytokinins signal more cells to form and gib-

expands, nourished by a supply of stored food
within the seed. Soon, the seed's coating splits, a
rootlet grows downward, and a sprout with seed
leaves pushes upwards in search of light

Seedling Growth
The single root from the seed grows down and
branches out, similar to the way the stem
branches up and out above ground. Tiny
rootlets draw in water and nutrients (chemical
substances needed for life). Roots also serve to
anchor a plant in the growing medium.
Seedling should receive 16- 18 hours of light to
maintain strong healthy growth.

Vegetative Growth
Vegetative growth is maintained by giVIng
· plants 16-24 hours of light every day. As the
plant matures, the roots take on specialized
functions. The center and old, mature portions
contain a water transport system and may also
store food. The tips of the roots produce elongating cells that continue to push farther and farther into the soil in search of more water and
food. The single-celled root hairs are the parts
of the root that actually absorb water and nutri-

ent.s. Without water, frail root hairs will dry up
and die. They are very delicate and are easily
damaged by light, air, and klutzy hands if moved
or exposed. Extreme care must be exercised
during transplanting.
Like the roots, the stem grows through elonga·
tion, also producing new buds along the stem.
The central or terminal bud carries growth
upward; side or lateral buds turn into branches
or leaves. The stem functions by transmitting
water and nutrients from the delicate root hairs
to the growing buds, leaves, and flowers. Sugars
and starches manufactured in the leaves are dis·
tributed through the plant via the stem. This
fluid flow takes place near the surface of the
stem. If the stem is bound too tightly by string
or other tie downs, it will cut the flow of life-giv·
ing fluids, thereby strangling and killing the
plant. The stem also supports the plant with stiff
cellulose, located within the inner walls.
Outdoors, rain and wind push a plant around,
causing much stiff cellulose production to keep
the plant supported upright. Indoors, with no
natural wind or rain present, stiff cellulose pro·
duction is minimal, so plants develop weak
stems and may need to be staked up, especially
during flowering.
Once the leaves expand, they start to manufac·
ture food (carbohydrates). Chlorophyll (the sub·
stance that gives plants their green color) con·
verts carbon dioxide (C01) from the air, water,
and light energy into carbohydrates and oxygen.
This process is called photosynthesis. It requires
water drawn up from the roots, through the
stem, into the leaves where it encounters carbon
dioxide. Tiny breathing pores called stomata are
located on the underside of the leaf and funnel
•
C0 2 into contact with the water. In order for
photosynthesis to occur, the leaf's interior tissue
must be kept moist. The stomata open and
close to regulate the flow of moisture, prevent·
ing dehydration. Marijuana leaves are also protected from drying out by an outer skin. The
stomata also permit the outflow of water vapor
and waste oxygen. The stomata are very impor·
tant to the plant's well being and must be kept

clean to promote vigorous growth. Dirty,
clogged stomata would breathe about as well as
you would with a sack over your head!

Pre-Flowering
Cannabis grown from seed dawns pre-flowers
after the fourth week of vegetative growth. They
generally appear between the fourth and sixth
node from the bottom of the plant. Cannabis
plants are normally either all male or all female.
Each sex has its own distinct flowers. Pre-flowers will be either male or female. Growers
remove and destroy the males (or use them for
breeding stock) because they have low levels of
cannabinoids (THC, CBD, CBN, etc.). Female
plants are cultivated for their high cannabinoid
content.

Once the branch tip has been M bottom leaves are
trimmed off before planting the clone, an exact replica of
the mother plant.

Mother Plants
Growers select strong, healthy, potent mother
plants they know are female. Mothers are given
18-24 hours of light daily so they stay in the vegetative growth stage. Growers cut branch tips
from the mother plants and root them. The
rooted cuttings are called "clones." Cultivating
several strong, healthy mother plants is the key
to having a consistent supply of all-female
clones.

Clones grow a strong root system in 14·21 days under
flt~orescent light. Once rooted, they spend from 7-30
days in vegetative growth

Cloning
Branch tips are cut and rooted to form clones.
Clones take 10-20 days to grow a strong healthy

given 18-24 hours of
light so they stay in the
vegetative growth stage.
Once the root system is
established, clones are
transplanted into larger
containers. Now they
are ready to grow for 1-4
weeks in the vegetative
growth stage before
being induced to flower.

Flowering
Cannabis flowers outdoors in the fall when
days become shorter
and plants are signaled
that the annual life cycle
is coming to an end. At
flowering, plant functions change.

regions often start flowering under more light
and less darkness. Flowers form during the last
stage of growth. Left unpollinated, female flowers develop without seeds, "sinsemilla." When
fertilized with male pollen, female flower buds
develop seeds.
Unpollinated, female cannabis flowers continue to swell and produce more resin while waiting for male pollen to successfully complete
their life cycle. After weeks of heavy flower and
cannabinoid-laden resin production, THC production peaks out in the unfertilized, frustrated
sinsemilla!

Cannabis has both male and female plants.
When both male and female flowers are in
bloom, pollen from the male flower lands on
!he female flower, thereby fertilizing it. The male
dies after producing and shedding all his pollen.
Seeds form and grow within the female flowers.
As the seeds are maturing, the female plant
slowly dies. The mature seeds then fall to the
ground and germinate naturally or
are collected for planting next
spring.

Cannabis Strains

.

Technically and legally, all cannabis,
whether rope or dope, is classified as
Cannabis sativa. Regardless of origin, all
cannabis is considered Cannabis sativa (C.
sativa) under international law. However,
according to Hemp Diseases and Pests, Dr. J.
M. McPartland, R. C. Clarke, and D. P. Watson,
CAB International, Cannabis sativa can be
further classified as: Cannabis sativa (= C.
sativa var. sativa), Cannabis indica (= C. sativa var. indica), Cannabis ruderalis (= C. sativa var. spondanea), Cannabis afghanica (=
C. sativa var. afghanica). Each has distinct
growth patterns, look, smell, taste, etc.

Cannabis Sativa

The main bud on this 'Thai' plant growing
'um1er the tropical sun appears to be much
rr1Pt1<:Pr that it actually is.

~

•.

Leaf from the strain 'Thaitanic' demonstrates
the classic C. sativa characteristics-long, thin
blades or fingers.

Cannabis sativa (- C. sativa var. sativa),
originated predominately in Asia, the
Americas, and Africa. Each area of origin has
specific characteristics, but all have the following general traits: tall, leggy stature with
spacious internodal length, a large sprawling
root system, large narrow-bladed leaves,
and somewhat sparse flowers when grown
indoors under lights. Sativas bloom several
weeks to months later than indica strains.
While good producers outdoors, often growing to 15 feet (4.5 m) or more, indoors pure
sativa strains often grow too tall too fastsome up to ten feet in three months-to be
practical for grow room cultivation. An HID
bulb is unable to efficiently illuminate tall
plants, and the yield-per-watt-of-light or
yield-per-square-foot-of-space is very low.
Mexican, Columbian, Thai, and Jamaican
strains can be very potent, with a high THC
to CBD ratio that produces a soaring, energetic, "speedy" high. But potency can also be
minimal, with low levels of THC. Most
exported Columbian, Mexican, Thai, and
Jamaican marij uana is poorly treated
throughout life and abused when dried and
packed. This abuse causes more rapid

degradation of THC. Consequently, seeds
from fair smoke are often more potent than
the parent.
Central African salivas, including the THCpotent 'Congolese', grow similarly to
Columbian strains, with a tall leggy stature,
often growing more than 15 feet (4.5
meters) tall with loosely packed buds.
South Africa has major seaports. Sailors
brought Cannabis sativa from many different places and planted it in South Africa.

Cannabis Ruderalis
Cannabis ruderalis (= C. sativa var. spondanea) was first brought to Amsterdam from
Central Europe in the early1980s by the Seed
Bank to enhance their breeding program.
Very similar, if not the same "ruderalis" plants
grow from Minnesota north through
Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada.
C. ruderalis is a short, weedy, scrubby plant
containing very, very little THC, but it starts
the flowering cycle after a few weeks growth.
Photoperiod does not induce flowering in
C. ruderalis. Sometimes confused with more
potent indicas, pure C. ruderalis is true ditch
weed. It yields a headache rather than a
high! Today a few breeders have incorporated the early flowering C. ruderalis genes with
other early blooming C. sativa, C. indica, and
C. afghanica.

Cannabis indica plant

Cannabis indica leaf has broader blades than
C. sativa leaves, but not as broad as
C. afghanica.

'Lowryder' is one of the few C. ruderalis crosses that is auto-flowering and THC-potent

Cannabis Afghanica
Cannabis afghanica (= C. sativa var.
afghanica) originated near present day
Afghanistan. It is quite short, seldom reaching
six feet, with distinctive, broad, dark-green
leaflets and leaves. Dense branching and
short internodes, most often with long leaf
stems (petioles), dominate the profile of
C. afghanica. The most common examples of
pure C. afghanica include the many different
hash plants and Afghani strains. C. afghanica
is cultivated exclusively for drugs with much
of the resin being made into hashish. It is
known for the high cannabinoid content.
Many growers and breeders do not distinguish C. afghanica from C. indica, lumping
them both into the C. indica category.

'Hash Plant: of which there are many, is one
of the classic C. afghanica strains.

One of the first Seed Bonk catalogs from 1987
shows a C. ruderalis plant alongside the highway in Hungary. Many breeders mistakenly
hailed this plant as the "Holy Grail'' of
cannabis.

C. afghanica has very wide and distinctive
leaflets and leaves.

Seeds

Close-up of 'Power Plant' seeds..

'Kali Mist' seeds are spotted and mottled

Explosive growth of seed breeders and
legal seed sales in the Netherlands, the
United
Kingdom,
Canada,
France,
Switzerland, Spain, etc., has given way to
more strains of cannabis than ever before.
Most popular strains of cannabis are a combination of two or more of the following:
C. sativa, C. indica, C. ruderalis, and
C. afghanica. But there are also many seeds
with the genes from jost one of the above.
These strains of cannabis are bred to grow
best indoors. Others grow best in greenhouses, and still others outdoors in specific climates. See Chapter Seventeen, "Breeding,"
for information about hybrid seeds including
Fl, F2, F3, etc., hybrids.
A seed contains all the genetic characteristics of a plant. Seeds are the result of sexual
propagation and contain genes from each
parent, male and female. Some plants,
known as hermaphrodites, bear both male
and female flowers on the same plant. The
genes within a seed dictate a plant's size; disease and pest resistance; root, stem, leaf, and
flower production; cannabinoid levels; and
many other traits. The genetic makeup of a
seed is the single most important factor dictating how well a plant will grow under artificial light or natural sunlight and the levels of
cannabinoids it will produce.
Strong, healthy parents and proper care
yield strong seeds that germinate well.
Strong seeds produce healthy plants and
heavy harvests. Seeds stored too long will
germinate slowly and have a high rate of failure. Vigorous seeds initiate growth within
seven days or sooner. Seeds that take longer
than a month to germinate could always be
slow and produce less. However, some
seeds take longer to germinate even under
the best conditions.
The cask, or outer protective shell, on some
seeds never properly seals, which allows
moisture and air to penetrate. It also causes

hormone concentrations to dissipate and
make seeds less viable. Permeable seeds signal diseases and pests to move in. Such seeds
are immature, white, fragile, and crush easily
with slight pressure between finger and
thumb. These are weak seeds and do not have
enough strength to grow well.
Typically, a grower who acquires a bag of ten
quality seeds from a reputable seed company
germinates them all at once. Once germinated, the seeds are carefully planted and grown
to adulthood. By and large, of the ten seeds,
some will be male, some will be weak and
grow poorly, and two or three seeds will grow
into strong, super females. Of these "super"
females, one will be more robust and potent
than her siblings. This super female is selected
to be the mother of countless super clones.
A simple picture of a seed reveals an embryo
containing the genes and a supply of food
wrapped in a protective outer coating. Mature
seeds that are hard, beige to dark brown, and
spotted or mottled have the highest germination rate. Soft, pale, or green seeds are usually immature and should be avoided. Immature
seeds germinate poorly and often produce
sickly plants. Fresh, dry, mature seeds less than
a year old spr~ut quickly and g'row robust
plants.

Germination
Cannabis seeds need only water, heat, and
air to germinate. They do not need extra hormones to germinate. Seeds sprout without
light in a wide range of temperatures.
Properly nurtured seeds germinate in two to
seven days, in temperatures from 70-90°F
(21-32°C). Temperatures above 90°F (32°C)

impair germination. At germination, the outside protective shell of the seed splits, and a
tiny, white sprout (radicle) pops out. This
sprout is the root or taproot. Cotyledon, or
seed leaves, emerge from within the shell as
they push upward in search of light.
Seeds are prompted to germinate by:
Water
Temperature
Air (oxygen)

Water
Soaking seeds in water allows moisture to
penetrate the protective seed shell within
minutes. Once inside, moisture continues to
wick in to activate the dormant hormones. In
a few days, hormones activate and send
enough hormone signals to produce a radicle. The radicle emerges upward to bring a
new plant into the world. Once a seed
receives moisture, there must be a constant

Temperature
Cannabis seeds grow best at 78°F (25°C).
Low temperatures delay germination.
High temperatures upset seed chemistry
causing poor germination.
Seeds germinate best under the native conditions where they were grown.
Once germinated, move seedlings to a
slightly cooler growing area, and increase
light levels. Avoid high temperatures and low
light levels, which cause lanky growth.

Air (oxygen)
Seeds need air to germinate. Moist, soggy
growing mediums will cut off oxygen supplies and the seed will literally drown.
Planting seeds too deeply also causes poor
germination. Seedlings do not have enough
stored energy to force through too much soil
before sprouting. Plant seeds twice as deep
as the width of the seed. For example, plant
a 0.125-inch (0.3 mm) seed 0.25-inch (6
mm) deep.
Household water contains enough dissolved solids (food) to nourish seeds
through their first few weeks of life. Although
seeds need only 30-50 ppm of nitrates
before they germinate, any more will disrupt
internal chemistry. Some growers prefer to
use distilled water that contains virtually no
dissolved solids to germinate seeds. In fact, a
high concentration of dissolved solids (salts)
in the water will actually pull moisture out of
the seed!
Start feeding two to four weeks after
seedlings have sprouted. Some growers wait
until leaves yellow to begin feeding. Use a
mild quarter-strength solution. If yellowing
persists, give seedlings a little more fertilizer.

Some seeds have a very hard outer shell,
testa, and must be scarified to allow water to
penetrate. To scarify, line a matchbox with a
piece of fine-grain sandpaper or emery
board. Put the seeds in the matchbox and
shake for about 30 seconds. Remove the
seeds, and make sure they have been
scuffed a bit. Just a little scuffing will allow
water to enter and set germination in
motion.

To scarify seeds, place a small emery board
inside a matchbox along with seeds.

Two Popular Germination
Techniques:
One: Pre-soal<ing in water
Soak seeds overnight in a glass of water.
Make sure seeds get good and wet so
growth is activated. Do not let seeds soak
more than 24 hours, or they might get too
wet, suffer oxygen deprivation, and rot. Once
soaked, seeds are ready to be placed
between moist paper towels to sprout or be
planted in a root c~;~be or fine, light soilless
.
m1x.
In a warm location (70-90°F, (21 -32°q),
place seeds in a moist paper towel or
cheesecloth, making sure they are in darkness. Set the moist cloth or paper towel in a
vertical position (so tap root grows down) on
a grate (for drainage) on a dinner plate.
Water the cloth daily, and keep it moist. Let
excess water drain away freely. The cloth will
retain enough moisture to germinate the
seed in a few days. The seed contains an
adequate food supply for germination.
Prevent fungal attacks by watering with a
mild two-percent bleach or fungicide solution. Once seeds have sprouted and the
white sprout is visible, carefully pick up the
fragile sprouts (with tweezers) and plant
them. Take care not to expose the tender
rootlet to prolonged intense light or air.
Cover the germinated seed with 0.25-0.5inch (1 -2 em) of fine planting medium with
the white root tip pointing down.

One of the problems with rockwool can be
that the seeds heave out before germinating.
This is why it is best to germinate seeds
before putting them into the rockwool substrate.
Once seeds have sprouted and the white
sprout is visible, carefully pick up the fragile
sprouts (with tweezers) and plant them in a
pre-drilled hole in the rockwool with the
white root tip pointing down. Take care not
. to expose the tender rootlet to prolonged
intense light or air. Cover the germinated
seed with one-quarter to one-half inch of
moist rockwool. Keep the rockwool evenly
moist. Once the taproot sprouts, small fuzzy
feeder roots will grow in 12-14 days.
Water penetrates the outer protective shell,
continues to wick in, and activates dormant
hormones that induce germination. Once a
seed receives moisture, there must be a constant stream of moisture to transport nutrients, hormones, and water to carry on life
processes. Letting germinated seed suffer
moisture stress now will stunt or stop
seedling growth. The black tip of 'the root

Soggy growing mediums cut oxygen supplies and cause seeds to drown. Planting

!Jiffy pellets expand when water is added. They
make excellent pop-up pots to grow seedlings.
They are also very easy to transplant

Seeds set inside rockwool blocks often heave
up and out. Germinate seeds before planting
to avoid this common problem.

Seedlings do not have enough stored
energy to force through too much soil
before sprouting. Plant seeds twice as
deep as the width of the seed. For
example, plant an eighth-inch seed
one-quarter inch deep.

This germinated seedling was allowed to dry
out for a little more than on hour. Notice how
the tip of the root has shriveled. This seemingly small oversight caused the resulting plant to
have a very slow start in life.

Grow More Female Plants
from Seed
Environmental factors start influencing sex
the moment the seedling has three pairs of
true leaves (not counting cotyledons).
Environmental factors that influence sex
determination of cannabis include but are
not limited to:
Increasing the level of nitrogen makes
more female plants. Lower the nitrogen level
to create more male plants. Increase the
level of potassium to increase male tendencies; lowering the potassium level encourages female plants. A higher nitrogen level
and a lower potassium level for the first two
weeks increases females.
Low temperatures increase the number of
female plants. Warm temperatures make
more male plants.
High humidity increases the number of
female plants. Low humidity increases male
plants.
Low growing-medium moisture increases
males.
More blue light increases the number of
female plants. More red light increases male
tendencies.
Fewer hours of daylight (e.g. 14 hours)
increases the number of females. Longer

Seedlings
When a seed sprouts, the white taproot
emerges. Soon afterward, the cotyledon, also
known as seed or seedling leaf, appears. The
seed leaves spread out as the stem elongates.
Within a few days, the first true leaves appear,
and the little plant is now officially a seedling.
This growth stage lasts for three to six weeks.
During seedling growth, a root system grows
rapidly while green aboveground growth is
slow. Water and heat are critical at this point of
development. The new, fragile root system is
very small and requires a small but constant
supply of water and warmth. Too much water
will drown roots, often leading to root rot and
damping-off. Lack of water will cause the
infant root system to dry up. As the seedlings
mature, some will grow faster, stronger, and
appear healthy in general. A little heat now
will help nurture small seedlings to a strong
start. Other seeds will sprout slowly and be
weak and leggy. Cull sickly, weak plants, and
focus attention on the remaining strong survivors. Seedlings should be big enough to thin
out by the third to fifth week of growth.
T.hinning out seedlings is very difficult for
growers who pay $300 dollars for a few seeds!
Seedlings need at least 16 hours of light
daily. They require less intense light now and
grow well under fluorescent tubes for the first
two to three weeks. Compact fluorescent and
HID light can also be used. The compact fluorescent should be 12-18 inches (30-45 em)
and the HI D 3-4 feet (90-120 em) above
seedlings for best growth.

The seedling stage is over when rapid
foliage growth starts. Rapid growth above
ground is the beginning of the vegetative
growth stage. Plants need more room to
grow; transplanting into a larger container
hastens development.

Strong, healthy seedlings like this 'White
Widow' are the key to a heavy harvest

Ordering Seeds
Ordering seeds via a magazine ad or the
Internet is commonplace. Many reputable
companies advertise. You are most secure to
order from a company you can contact by
telephone. Speak to a qualified representative who will provide good answers to your
questions. Companies with an e-mail
address and web site are usually okay to
order from, but make sure they answer your
e-mails promptly. Do not be afraid to call several companies and ask them specific questions about the strains they sell. If you live in
a country where seeds are illegal, call from a

not call the seed company from a telephone
located at a grow house.
Communicating via e-mail can leave a trail
to the computer if you do not use a proxy
server. Check out www.overgrow.com for
more information on how to set up and use
proxy servers.
Some seed companies produce their own
seed and sell it directly to the public. Most
seed producers sell their seed to a reseller
such as www.kiodseed.com, www.the
arnsterdarn.com, or www.hemP..Qc.com
(Heaven's Stairway).
Check the "StrainGuide" on www.over
grow,com to find more information about
growing specific strains. Once you decide on
what to order and have communicated with
the company, you are ready to place your
order. Do not use a credit card if security is a
concern. Companies normally bill your credit
card discreetly and do not charge your credit
card with "Cannabis Seeds." However, if you
decide to use a credit card, discuss the matter with the retailer. You may decide to use
an international money order. Cash tells no
tales and leaves no trails. Wrap the cash in
carbon paper so that it cannot be seen. Allow
a reasonable amount of time, two to four
weeks, for the order to arrive. Do not forget
that sometimes packages are lost, misplaced,
and mislabeled.

Boy Ramsahai, owner of High Quality Seeds and Black Label Seeds, shows off his high-tech
refrigerator for seed storage. The refrigerator keeps humidity levels below five percent to ensure
safe long-term storage.

Storing Seeds
Store seeds in a cool, dark, dry place. Make
sure to label containers! Some seeds will
remain viable for five years or longer when
stored properly. When 50 percent of the
stored seeds do not germinate, the average
storage life is over. But seeds a year old or
older often take longer to sprout and have a
lower rate of germination.
Seed hormones-ABA, cytokinins, and gibberellins-are primed to respond to moisture,
which is the first signal to germinate. Prevent
moisture from signaling seeds to germinate
by keeping them dry. Small amounts of
moisture in the form of condensation can
give seeds a false start on germination and
cause them to expend all their stored energy.
Avoid moisture levels above five percent to
ensure viable seed. Moisture levels above
five percent will cause germination levels to
decrease rapidly. Seal seed in an airtight con·
tainer, and place silicon crystal packages in
the container to absorb excess moisture.
Cannabis seeds need enough moisture to
initiate this process within 48 hours.

Seeds store for a long time when humidity is
less than 5 percent and temperature is
35-40° F (2·5° C).

Dry seeds are temperature-sensitive; they
can be disinfected with a short application of
heat. Low temperatures slow internal seed
activity so are best for preserving seeds. You
can use super-cold liquid nitrogen and cryogenics to store seeds for a long time.
Air, once it enters the outer seed shell, signals seeds to germinate. Viable seeds are
preserved longer when vacuum-packed to
remove all oxygen.
Seeds with a thin, outer protective shell
never truly go dormant, because moisture
and air are always present within. This moisture and air cause hormone levels to slowly
dissipate. Such seeds do not store well for a
long time.

Seed Pests
Seed pests become active when there is
more than ten percent moisture content.
When the growing medium contains more
than fifteen percent moisture, fungi become
active. Excess fertilizer slows seedling growth
and promotes fungus attacks.
Temperatures from 68-85°F {20-30°C) promote Pythium (damping-off) and rhixocto·
nia fungi. Cannabis seeds grow best at 78°F
(25°C). Most fungi reproduce fastest in a
temperature range of 68-86°F (20-30°C).
Keep a wary eye on problems. Nutrient
overdose burns leaf tips and fringes, which
can look like damping-off to the
untrained eye. Do not fertilize.
Applying a fungicide now will
make the problem worse.

maintained, marijuana will grow from onehalf to two inches per day. A plant stunted
now could take weeks to resume normal
growth. A strong, unrestricted root system is
essential to supply much needed water and
nutrients. Unrestricted vegetative growth is
the key to a healthy harvest. A plant's nutrient
and water intake changes during vegetative
growth. Transpiration is carried on at a more
rapid rate, requiring more water. High levels
of nitrogen are needed; potassium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and trace
elements are used at much faster rates. The
larger a plant gets and the bigger the root system, the faster the soil will dry out. The key to
strong vegetative growth and a heavy harvest
is supplying roots and plants with the perfect
environment.
Vegetative growth is maintained with 16 or
more hours of light. I used to believe a point
of diminishing returns was reached after 18
hours of light, but further research shows that
vegetative plants grow faster under 24 hours
of light. Marijuana will continue vegetative
growth a year or longer (theoretically forever), as long as an 18-hour photoperiod is
maintained.
Cannabis is photoperiodic-reactive; flowering can be controlled with the light and dark
cycle. This allows indoor horticulturists to
control vegetative and flowering growth.
Once a plant's sex is determined, it can
become a mother, clone, or breeding male,
and can be harvested or even rejuvenated.
Note: Plants show early male or female
"pre-flowers" about the fourth week of vegetative growth. See "Pre-flowering" in Chapter
Four and the sections here on pre-flowering
male and female.

Cloning, transplanting, pruning, and bending are all initiated when plants are in the
vegetative growth stage.

Clones and Cloning
Marijuana can be reproduced (propagated)
sexually or asexually. Seeds are the product of
sexual propagation; cuttings or clones are the
result of asexual or vegetative propagation. In
its simplest form, taking a cutting or clone
involves cutting a growing branch tip and
rooting it. Technically, cloning is taking one
cell of a plant and promoting its growth into
a plant. Marijuana growers commonly refer to
a clone as meaning a branch of a cannabis
plant that has been cut off and rooted.
Cloning reduces the time it takes for a crop
to mature. Productive growers have two
rooms, a vegetative/cloning room, about a
quarter the size of a second room used for
flowering. Smaller vegetative plants take up
less space than older fl owering plants. For
example, a 250- or 400-watt metal halide
could easily illuminate vegetative plants and
clones that would fill a flowering room lit by
three 600-watt HP sodiums. If the halide is
turned off; fluorescent and compact fluorescent lamps are more economical and work
well to root clones.
Combine eight-week flowering/harvest
cycles with continuous cloning to form a perpetual harvest. One easy-to-implement scenario is to take two clones every four days,
and harvest one ripe female every other day.
Every time a plant is harvested, one or two
rooted clones are moved from a constantly
supplied vegetative room into the flowering
room. This regimen gives a grower 30 flowering clones that are on a 91-day schedule. It
takes 91 days from the time a clone is cut
from the mother plant until the day it is harvested. Using this schedule, a grower would
have 30 clones, 10 vegetative plants, and 30
flowering plants growing at all times. See
chart next page.

Swiss retailers sold clones over-the-counter
until the law changed in 200 I. Now, Swiss
growers have gone underground.

A sea of clones share all genetic characteristics. They will all grow up to look like their
mothers.

Induce clones to flower when they are four
to twelve inches tall to make most efficient
use of HID light. Artificial light diminishes to
the square of the distance, which means that
foliage four feet away from the bulb receives
one fourteenth as much light as if it were
one foot away! Foliage that is shaded or
receives less light grows slowly and looks
spindly.
Short crops of clones in small containers
are much easier to move and maintain than
big plants in big containers. Short clones are
also easy and efficient to grow in greenhouses and outdoors.
Well-illuminated, strong clones grow fast
and have less chance of being affected by
pests and diseases. Fast-growing clones
develop more quickly than spider mites can
reproduce. By the time a spider mite infestation is noticed and sprayed, the plants are a
few weeks from harvest. Clones are also easy
to submerge in a miticide when small.
Experiments with clones are consistent and
easy to control. Genetically identical clones
respond the same to different stimuli, such
as fertilizer, light, bending, etc. After experimenting on several crops of clones from the
same mother, a grower has a very good idea
what it takes to make them grow well.

Mother Plants

•
Two 'Queen Mother' plants will soon bear
many, many clones.

Any plant can be cloned, regardless of age
or growth stage. Take clones from mother
plants that are at least two months old.
Plants cloned before they are two months
old may develop unevenly and grow slowly.
.Clones taken from flowering plants root
quickly but require a month or longer to
revert back to vegetative growth. Such rejuvenated clones occasionally flower prematurely, and buds are more prone to pest and
disease attacks.
Any female can become a mother. She can
be grown from seed or be a clone of a clone.
I interviewed several growers who made

clones of clones more than 20 times! That is,
clones (C-1) were taken from the original
female grown from seed. These clones were
grown in the vegetative stage, and clones
(C-2) were taken from the first clones (C- 1).
Blooming was induced in (C-1) two weeks
later and (C-2), grown in the vegetative
stage. Then, clones (C-3) were taken from
the second clones (C-2). This same growing
technique is still going on with clones of
clones well past (C-20) and there has been
no apparent breakdown in the potency or
the vigor of the clone. However, if mothers
suffer stress, they produce weak clones.
Mothers that are forced to flower and revert
back to vegetative growth not only yield less,
they are stressed and confused. Clones that
grow poorly are generally the result of poor,
unsanitary cloning practices.
A clone is an exact genetic replica of the
mother plant. Each mother's cell carries a
DNA blueprint of itself. Radiation, chemicals,
and poor cultural practices can damage this
DNA. Unless damaged, the DNA remains
intact.
A female plant will reproduce 100 percent
females, all exactly like the mother. When
grown in the exact same environment,
clones from the same mother look alike. But
the same clones subjected to distinct environments in different grow rooms will often
look different.
A six-month old plant produces more
cannabinoids than a one-month old plant. By
cloning, a horticulturist is planting a THepotent plant that will continue to grow in
potency at a very rapid rate. A month-old
rooted clone acts exactly like a four-monthold plant and can be induced easily to flower
with a 12-hour photoperiod.
Keep several mother plants in the vegetative stage for a consistent source of cloning
stock. Start new mothers from seed every
year. Give mother plants 18-24 hours of light
per day to maintain fast growth. For best

es. See drawing on previous page. A rigid
branch that folds over quickly when bent is a
good sign of high carbohydrate content.
Hormone content is different in different
parts of a plant. Root growth hormones are
concentrated near the base of the plant close
to the main stem. This is the oldest portion
of the plant and is where most root hormones are located. The top of the plant contains older hormones; cuttings taken from
this part root slowly.

While rooting, clones require a minimum of
nitrogen and increased levels of phosphorus
to promote root growth. Sprays should be
avoided during rooting as they compound
cloning stress. Given good instruction and a
little experience, most growers achieve a
consistent, 100 percent clone survival rate.
Large cuttings with large stems packed with
starch grow roots slower than small clones
with small stems. The excess starch in moist
substrate also attracts diseases. Thinstemmed clones have fewer reserves (accumulated starch), but they only need enough
reserve energy to initiate root growth.
Small clones with few leaves root faster
than big cuttings with many leaves. At first
leaves contain moisture, but after a few days,
the stem is no longer able to supply enough
moisture to the 11eaves, and the clone suffers
stress. A small amount of leaf space is all that

This chart shows average times for roots to grow from the cambium. Note clones taken

Negative points
Clones grow slower than Fl hybrid plants
grown from seed. An Fl hybrid is the hetero zygous
first
filial
generationpollen and ovule. Fl hybrids have "hybrid
vigor" which means that this cross will grow
about 25 percent bigger and stronger than
cuttings. Hybrid vigor also makes plants less
susceptible to pest and disease problems.
Always start with the best mothers you can
find. A mother plant yields clones in her
image. If the mother plant lacks potency, harvest weight, or is not pest and disease resistant, the clone shares her drawbacks. These
weaknesses are compounded when growing
only one strain. An unchecked pest or disease infestation could wipe out the entire
crop.
Some growers have a difficult time learning
to make clones. If this is the case, continue
to work through the little problems one step
at a time, and you will learn. Some people
have a little longer learning curve when
cloning is involved. Take five to ten practice
clones before making a serious cloning. You
can also work with strains that are easy to
clone, as illustrated in the chart below.
Plants that are easy to done
Most Skunk and Indica strains are easy to
clone.
Growers and sick plants cause most clone
rooti.ng problems.. Weak plants that lack vigor
prov1de slow-rootmg weak clones. Poor
growing conditions also affect clone
strength.
Harder to clone:
Ruderalis Indica and Ruderalis Skunk do
not make suitable mother plants due to their
auto-flowering capability. Outdoor strains
with a slight tendency to pre-sex in an 18hr
photoperiod include: Early Girl, Early Skunk
and many others. Check with seed companies for details. But early flowering does not
exclude them as mother plants.

Getting Ready
Cloning is the most traumatic incident
cannabis plants can experience. Clones go
through an incredible transformation when
they change from a severed growing tip to a
rooted plant. Their entire chemistry changes.
The stem that once grew leaves must now
grow roots in order to survive. Clones are at
their most tender point in life now.
Clones quickly develop a dense system of
roots when stems have a high carbohydrate
and low nitrogen concentration. Build carbohydrate levels by leaching the growing medium with copious quantities of water to flush
out nutrients. The growing medium must
drain very well to withstand heavy leaching
without becoming w aterlogged. Reverse
foliar feeding w ill leach nutrients from leaves
'
especially nitrogen. To reverse foliar feed, fill
a sprayer w ith clean water and mist mother
heavily every morning for three or four days.
Older leaves may turn light green; growth
slows as nitrogen is used and carbohydrates
build. Carbohydrate and hormonal content is
liighest in lower, older, more mature branch-

liquid rooting hormones can be mixed in
different concentrations. Always mix the
most dilute concentration for softwood cuttings. Apply any rooting hormone containing
IBA only once. If exceeded in concentration
or duration, JBA applications impair root formation. As soon as cuttings are taken, clones
start dispatching rooting hormones to the
wound. They arrive in full force in about a
week. The artificial rooting hormone fills the

need until natural hormones' take over.
-Give cuttings a 5-15 second dip in concentrated solutions of IBA and NAA, 500-20,000
ppm. With a quick dip, stems evenly absorb
the concentrated hormone.

is necessary for photosynthesis to supply
enough energy for root growth.

Precautions
An embolism is a bubble of air that gets
trapped in the hole in the stem. Embolisms
occur when you take big clones and lay them
on the counter before placing in water or a
growing medium. When an embolism happens, fluid flow stops, and clones die. After
taking cuttings, immediately dip them in
water or a growing medium to prevent air
from getting trapped in the hollow stems.
Eliminate the threat of an embolism by taking cuttings under water.
Clones root well within a pH range of five
to six. Aeroponic clone gardens normally do
best with a pH of five to five and a half. Most
diseases grow poorly below these pH levels.
Always make sure there is plenty of air in the
rooting medium; this will stimulate root
growth.
Do not kill clones with kindness and fertilizer. At best, giving clones an excess dose of fertilizer causes rooting to be delayed. In fact, a
good dose of ammonium nitrate, a common
fertilizer, will stop root hairs from growing.
If an infestation occurs, apply aerosol
pyrethrum. Remember, all pesticides, natural
or not, are phytotoxic. Spraying cuttings is a
bad idea in general. If you must use sprays,
use natural organic sprays, apply them when
it is cool, and keep their use to a minimum.
Use anti-desiccant sprays sparingly, if at all,
and only if a humidity dome is unavailable.
Anti-desiccant sprays clog stomata and can
impair root growth in clones.
Do not over-water clones. Keep the medium evenly moist, and do not let it get soggy.
Any kind of stress disrupts hormones and
slows rapid growth.
Keep the cloning area clean. Do not take
clones where fungus spores and diseases are
hiding! Pythium is the worst! Pythium flourishes in high temperatures and excessive
moisture. Mites, whiteflies, thrips, etc., love

Do not use fertilizers on clones or seedlings.

weak tender clones. Remove infested clones
from the room. Cooler conditions, 65-78°F
(18-25°C), slow mite and fungal spore reproduction and allow you to avert an infestation.

Rooting Hormones
Root-inducing hormones speed plant
processes. When the stem of a cutting develops roots, it must transform from producing
green stem cells to manufacturing undifferentiated cells and, finally, to fabricating root
cells. Rooting hormones hasten growth of
undifferentiated cells. Once undifferentiated,
cells quickly transform into root cells. Three
substances that stimulate undifferentiated
growth include napthalenaecetic acid (NAA),
indolebutyric acid (I BA) and 2, 4dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 3 DPA).
Commercial rooting hormones contain one,
two, or all of the above synthetic ingredients
and often include a fungicide to help prevent
damping-off.
Rooting hormones are available in liquid,
gel, or powder form. Liquid and gel types
penetrate stems evenly and are the most versatile and consistent. Powdered rooting hormones adhere inconsistently to stems, penetrate poorly, spur uneven root growth, and
yield a lower survival rate.

Rooting powders are a mixture of talc and
IBA and/or NAA and are less expensive than
liquids or gels. To use, roll the moistened end
of your cutting in the powder. Apply a thick,
even coat. To avoid contamination, pour a
small amount into a separate container, and
throw away any excess. Tap or scrape excess
powder off the cutting; excess hormones can
hinder root growth. Make a hole bigger than
the stem in the rooting medium. If the hole
is too small, the rooting powder gets scraped
off upon insertion.
You can also spray clones with a single
foliar spray of dilute IBA (50-90 ppm). Be
careful to spray just enough to cover leaves.
Spray should not drip off leaves. An IBA overdose slows growth, makes leaves dwarf, and
could even ki II the clone.
Some growers soak their cuttings in a dilute
solution (20-200 ppm IBA and/or NNA) for
24 hours. But I have seen few growers use
this time consuming technique.
To determine the rooting hormone concentration in parts per million, multiply the percentage listed by the manufacturer by
10,000. For example, a product with 0.9%
IBA contains 9000 ppm IBA.
An all-natural, root-inducing substance is
willow (tree) water. The substance in all willow trees that promotes rooting is unknown,
but repeated experiments have proven willow water promotes about 20 percent more
roots than plain water. This willow water is
mixed with commercial rooting hormones
for phenomenal results.
To make willow water rooting compound,
find any willow tree and remove some of this
year's branches that are about one and a half
inches in diameter. Remove the leaves, and
cut the branches into one-inch lengths. Place
one-inch willow sticks on end, so a lot of
them fit in a water glass or quart jar. Fill the
jar with water, and let it soak for 24 hours.
After soaking, pour off the willow water, and
use it for rooting hormone. Soak the marijuana clones in the willow water for 24 hours,

then plant in rooting medium. If using a
commercial liquid rooting hormone, substitute the willow water in place of regular
water in the mix.

Grow More Roots

Split the stem of clones to expose more of
the cambium layer just under th e "skin" of
the stern. It is the only place that generates
new roots.

Avoid problems:
Keep the work area clean. Wash work surfaces and tools before starting.
Have grow medium ready.
Prepare mother plant (scion).
Take clones.
Store unused clone.
Insert (stick) cutting in growing medium or
aeroponics system.
Place clones under humidity tent.
Look for root growth.
Transplant when roots emerge from root
cube or medium.
Harden-off by gradually exposing to new
environment.

Exposing the cambium layer causes
many roots to grow there. Lightly scraping
away the outer layer of the stem to expose
only the cambium allows hormones to
concentrate where roots start. Splitting the
clones' stem exposes more surface area to
grow roots. Both practices increase the
number of healthy roots, but rooting time
is a few days longer.
After the cutting has been trimmed and
scraped, dip the bare stem into a rooting
hormone. Now it is ready to "stick" into the
substrate.

Before Making Clones
Making clones or cuttings is the most efficient and productive means of cannabis
propagation for small growers, both indoors
and out. Once females have been distinguished, you are ready to practice the simple,
productive art and science of cloning.
Disinfect all tools and working surfaces to
kill bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other diseases already present. Use sharp scissors,
razor, or razor blade dipped in alcohol, vinegar, or bleach (five to ten percent solution).
Wash your hands thoroughly beforehand.
Make sure to have all cloning supplies within arm's reach- rooting cubes, hormone,
razor or scissors, humidity dome, etc.-before
you start to take clones.

Cloning: Step-by-Step
Step One: Choose a mother plant that is at
least two months old. Some varieties give
great clones even when pumped up with
hydroponics and fertilizer. If a variety is difficult to clone, leach the soil with two gallons
of water for each gallon of soil every morning
for a week before taking clones. Drainage
must be good. Or mist leaves heavily with
plain water every morning. Both practices
help wash out nitrogen. Do not add fertilizer.
Step Two: With a sharp blade, make a 45degree cut across firm, healthy 0.125-0.25inch-wide (3-6 mm) branches, two to four
inches four inches (3-5 em) in length. Take
care not to smash the end of the stem when
making the cut. Trim off two or three sets of
leaves and growth nodes so the stem can fit
into the soil. There should be at least two
sets of leaves above the soil line and one or
two sets of trimmed nodes below ground.
When cutting, make the slice halfway
between the sets of nodes. Immediately
place the cut end in water. Store cut clones

Hold cut clones in a glass of water until you
are ready to dip in hormone and plant.

in water while making more clones.
Step Three: Rockwool and Oasis'"' root cubes are
convenient and easy to maintain and transplant. Fill
small containers or nursery flats with coarse, washed
sand, fine vermiculite, soilless mix, or, if nothing else
is available, fine potting soil. Saturate the substrate
with water. Use an u"nsharpened pencil, chop stick,
nail, etc., to make a hole in the rooting medium-a little larger than the stem. The hole should stop about
one-half inch from the bottom of the container to
allow for root growth.
Place a tray containing rooting cubes or plugs into a
standard nursery rooting flat. If none exist, make
holes through three-fourths of the cube for clone
stems.
Fill rockwool tray with water, pH S-6. Always use
strong plastic trays.

J.Jmt· h

Grow clones until they are well-rooted. Always rememto label clones when planting.

Step Four: Use a rooting hormone, and mix
(if necessary) just before using. For liquids,
use the dilution ratio for softwood cuttings.
Swirl each cutting in the hormone solution
for 5-15 seconds. Place the cuttings in the
hole in the rooting medium. Pack rooting
medium gently around the stem. Gel and
powder root' hormones require no mixing.
Dip stems in gels as per instructions or roll
the stem in the powder. When planting, take
special care to keep a solid layer of hormone
gel or powder around the stem when gently
packing soil into place.
Step Five: lightly water until the surface is
evenly moist. Keep cuttings moist at all
times. Clones have no roots to bring water to
leaves. Water arrives from leaves and the cut
stem until roots can supply it. Water as needed to keep growing medium evenly moist.
Do not let it get soggy.
Step Six: Clones root fastest with 18-24
hours of fluorescent light. If clones must be
placed under an HID, set them on the
perimeter of the garden so they receive less
intense light; or shade them with a cloth or
screen. A fluorescent tube six inches above
clones or a 400-watt metal halide lamp four
to six feet away supplies the perfect amount
of light for clones to root. Cool white fluorescents (or a combination of warm and cool
white) are excellent for rooting.

humidity levels are 95-100 percent the first
two days and gradually reduced to 80-85
percent during the following week. A humidity tent will help keep humidity high.
Construct the tent out of plastic bags, rigid
plastic, or glass. Remember to leave openings for air to flow in and out so little clones
can breathe. If practical, mist clones several
times a day as an alternative to the humidity
tent. Remove any sick, rotting, or dead
foliage.
Cut leaves in half to lower transpiration surface and to keep them from overlapping.
Moisture that could foster fungus is often
trapped between overlapping leaves. Keep
the grow medium evenly moist so there is
enough moisture to prevent cut leaves from
bleeding out plant sugars that attract diseases.
Step Eight: Clones root faster when the
growing medium is a few degrees warmer
than the ambient air temperature. A warmer
substrate increases underground chemical
activity, and lower air temperature slows
transpiration. For best results, keep the rooting medium at 75-80°F (24-27°C). Growing
medium temperatures above 85°F (29°C)
will cause damage. Keep the air temperature
5-10°F (3-5.5°C) cooler than the substrate. A
warmer growing medium coupled with cooler ambient temperature slows diseases and
conserves moisture. Misting clones with
water also cools foliage and slows transpiration to help traumatized clones retain moisture unavailable from nonexistent roots.
. Put clones in a warm place to adjust air
temperature and use a heat pad, heating
cables, or an incandescent light bulb below
rooting cuttings.
Step Nine: Some cuttings may wilt but
regain rigidity in a few days. Clones should
lool< close to normal by the end of the week.
Cuttings that are still wilted after seven days
may root so slowly that they never catch up

with others. Cull them out, or put them back
into the cloning chamber to grow more
roots.
Step Ten: In one to three weel<s, cuttings
should be rooted. Signals they have rooted
include yellow leaf tips, roots growing out
drain holes, and vertical growth of the

Air layering
There is a good sequence of air layering in
Marijuana Botany, by Robert C. Clarke. To
date, I have never seen anybody use this
technique. It is interesting, but normally not
necessary. Cannabis is easy to root or clone.

two or three green leaves. If leaves have yellowed, survival chances diminish exponentially.

Storing Clones
To store cuttings for later use, wrap recently cut and trimmed stems in a damp cloth or
paper towel. Put the wrapped clones into a
plastic bag, and store in the refrigerator. On a
daily basis, remove the water that condenses
inside the bag in the cool refrigerator. Keep
the temperature above 40°F (5°C).
Temperatures below this level may cause
plant cells to rupture. Cuttings should last in
the refrigerator for about three weeks.

When plants are too big for their containers,
they must be transplanted to continue rapid
growth. Inhibited, cramped root systems
grow sickly, stunted plants. Signs of root
bound plants include slow, sickly growth and
branches that develop with more distance
between limbs. Severely root-bound plants
tend to grow straight up with few branches
that stretch beyond the sides of the pot. To
check for root-bound symptoms, remove a
plant from its pot to see if roots are deeply
matted on the bottom or surrounding the
sides of the pot.
When growing short plants that reach full
maturity in 90 days, there is little need for
containers larger than three gallons (11 L).
Large mother plants will need a large pot if
they are kept for more than a few months.

Dip rooted clones into a miticidal/fungicidal solution before transplanting and before
moving into the flowering room.
Mix a miticidal/fungicidal dip (1like Einstein
Oil) to disinfect clones before sticking them
in the growing medium. Fill a container with
low pl·l water (5-6) and add a natural fungicide such as hydrogen peroxide in a two percent solution. Or include a ten percent mix of
chlorine or vinegar. Do not mix vinegar and
chlorine! The resulting gas is hazardous.
See ''Transplanting."

In this container, roots are growing mainly
around the sides and along the bottom. This
plant is ready to be transplanted.

Transplant into the same type or similar
growing medium; otherwise, a water pressure differential could develop between the
different mediums, which slows water movement and causes slow root growth. Starting
seeds and clones in root cubes or peat pots
makes them easy to transplant. Set the cube
or peat pot in a hole in the growing medium,
and make sure growing medium is in firm
contact. Remember to keep root cubes and
substrates evenly moist after transplanting.
Transplanting is the second most traumatic
experience after cloning. It requires special
attention and manual dexterity. Tiny root
hairs are very delicate and may easily be
destroyed by light, air, or clumsy hands.
Roots grow in darlmess, in a rigid, secure
environment. When roots are taken out of
contact with the soil for long, they dry up and
die.
Transplanting should involve as little disturbance to the root system as possible. Water
helps the soil pack around roots and keeps
them from drying out. Roots need to be in
constant contact with moist soil in order to
supply water and food to the plant.
After transpla nting, photosynthesis and
chlorophyll production are slowed, as are
water and nutrient absorption via roots.
Transplant late in the day so transplanted
plants will have all night to recover.
Transplants need subdued light, so foliage
can grow at the rate roots are able to supply
water and nutrients. Give new transplants filtered, less-intense light for a couple of days.
If there is a fluorescent lamp handy, move
transplants under it for a couple of days
before moving them back under the HID or
outdoors to harden-off.
Ideally, plants should be as healthy as possible before being traumatized by transplanting. But, transplanting a sick, root-bound

in and re-establish a solid flow of fluids from
the roots throughout the plant. When transplanted carefully and disturbed litt le, there
will be no signs of transplant shock or wilt.
Double potting is a simple transplanting
technique that disturbs roots very little. To
double pot a plant, cut the bottom out of a
root-bound pot, and set on top of another
bigger pot of soil. Roots grow down into second pot.

care at this point to keep the root ball in one

Step Five: Carefully place the root ball in
the prepared hole in the three-gallon (11 L)
container. Make sure all roots are growing
down.
Step Six: Backfill around the root ball.
Gently, but firmly, place soil into contact with
root ball.
Step Seven: Water with half-strength fertilizer containing Trichoderma bacteria or
Vitamin Br Soil should be saturated-not
waterlogged-and drain freely. If rooting cube
and new substrate are not identical, pay
special attention to moisture levels. Let rockwool dry out enough so that roots penetrate
new growing medium in search of moisture.
Step Eight: Place new transplants on the
perimeter of the HID garden or under a
screen to subdue sunlight for a couple of
days. Once transplants look strong, move
them under full light.
Step Nine: Fertilize soilless mixes after
transplanting with a complete hydroponic
fertilizer that contains soluble chelated nutrients. New potting soil usually supplies
enough nutrients for a couple of weeks
before supplemental fertilization is necessary.

Seedlings and clones can also be transplanted directly into a three- to five-gallon
(11-19 L) pot, a system which requires fewer
containers and involves less work and less
possible plant stress. The larger volume of
soil holds water and nutrients longer and
requires less frequent watering. When clones
and seedlings are transplanted directly into a
five-gallon (19 L) container, the roots grow
down, out, and around the container walls
and bottom. In fact, the majority of roots
grow out of the soil and form a layer behind
the container wall.
To encourage roots to develop a dense
compact system, transplant just before they
have outgrown their container. Transplanting
a well-rooted clone in a root cube into a
four-inch (10-cm) pot and transplanting the
four-inch ( I 0-cm) pot into a three-gallon
(II L) pot or grow bag causes roots to develop a more extensive system in a small ball of
growing medium. Successful transplanting
causes minimal stress. Most marijuana crops
are in the ground for such a short time that
bungled transplanting costs valuable recuperation time and loss in production.
Transplant clones and seedlings into raised
beds and large planter boxes directly from
four-inch (10-cm) pots. As many as 20 plants
can be transplanted into a 24 x 24 x 12-inch
(61 x 61 x 30 em) planter, but six to twelve
plants will yield about the same dry weight of
buds. Once plants start crowding and shading one another, bend stems outward and tie
them to a trellis attached to the planter.

This clone was transplanted directly into a
large container at the Cannabis College in
Amsterdam.
Large planters require less maintenance. lhe
larger mass of soil retains water and nutrients much longer and more evenly. One
downside is that all plants must receive the
same water and diet.
Three-gallon (11 L) containers are the ideal
size for two- to three-foot-tall (60-90 em)
plants. Larger pots are usually unnecessary
because plants grow no longer than a week
or two in the vegetative stage and six to ten
weeks flowering. Smaller three-gallon ( 11 L)
pots are easy to move and handle. Roots also
grow less during flowering. By the time a
plant is potbound, it is ready to harvest. I
used to recommend up to a five-gallon
( 19 L) container for plants that are harvested
after 90 total days of life. I now believe this is
a waste. While the smaller containers require

Hardening-off
Hardening-off is the process of toughening-up clones and seedlings. During
the rooting process, leaves supplied much
of the moisture for the clone. Now,
healthy white new roots are supplying
moisture to the clone. Check for root
damage. Brown roots are rotting and lack
oxygen. Thin hair-like dark roots are dried
out. Once damaged, roots remain damaged. New roots must grow to replace
damaged roots. Cull out any clones with
damaged roots, because they will grow
slowly. The protective wax coating must

Harden off the strong ones, and introduce them to the real world- the grow room where they will see photosynthetically active
response (PAR) at full value and nutrients that make their cells quiver. Now is the time to
pre-grow clones before placing them into the flowering room.
Foliage loses its protective wax coating when it is pampered during cloning, so it is very
tender now. New roots must start to transport water via the stems to the leaves. The roots
and moisture-transport system start to work on strong, healthy clones first. Clones that lag
behind now should be tossed out, because they will always be slow. You can let them root
longer and not transplant them until adequate roots develop.

daily watering, they produce harvests
comparable to those of five-gallon
( 19 L) containers.
Mother plants are much larger, grow
longer, and can require containers up to
30 gallons (115 L) in size. However,
mother plants grow quite well in five or
ten-gallon (19-38 L) hydroponic containers for a year or longer. If you plan
to keep a mother plant for more than a
few months, grow it hydroponically in
its own container for best results.

Pruning and Bending
Pruning and bending a plant redirects
growth hormones. Pruning affects the plant
more drastically than bending. Selective
pruning and bending allow us to manipulate
auxin hormone levels in branch and flower
tips. Removing or bending a branch or
branch tip causes hormonal balances to shift.
Cutting the meristem (top growth tip) of a
cannabis plant will diffuse auxins and cause
greater concentrations in lower branch tips.
Bending a growing tip changes hormone
concentrations less than pruning.

Pruning
Always use clean instruments when pruning. A straight razor, single-edge razor blade,
a sharp pair of pruners, or a pair of scissors
all work well. Sanitize clippers and blades
between cuts by dipping in rubbing alcohol.
Use indoor pruners only in the indoor garden. Pruners used outdoors have everything
from spider mites to fungus spores on them.
If outdoor clippers must be used, dip in rubbing alcohol to sterilize before making cuts.
After pruning, the open wound invites diseases and pests. Wash your hands and tools
before and after pruning. Make cuts at a 45degree angle to discourage moisture from
sitting on wounds.
Avoid pruning up to a month before inducing flowering. Since pruning diffuses floral
hormones, flowering is retarded. If heavily
pruned shortly before flowering, peak maturation is delayed for a week or longer. It takes
a month or longer for hormones to build up
to pre-pruning concentrations.
Leave leaves alone! Removal of healthy
leaves hacks up a healthy plant. Removing
large fan or shade leaves DOES NOT make
plants more productive. This practice DOES
NOT supply more light to smaller leaves and
growing tips. Plants need all their leaves to
produce the maximum amount of chlorophyll and food. Removing leaves slows

and stunts its growth. Stress is a growth
inhibitor. Remove only dead leaves or leaves
that are more than so percent damaged.
Remove spindly branches and growth
that is not collecting light energy, including
dead and dying leaves. Pruning lower
branches concentrates auxins in upper
branches which forces growth upwards. Cut
lower branches off cleanly at the stem so no
stub is left to rot and attract pests and diseases. If you must harvest a little smoke prematurely, removing a few lower branches
will diminish the harvest the least.
Pruning out spindly branches and growth
inside plants opens up the interior and provides more and better air circulation. It also
allows light to reach deeper inside plants.
Not pruning has several advantages. Floral
hormones are allowed to concentrate in tips
of branches causing buds to grow stronger
and denser. Unpruned plants are crammed
into a small area. Crowded plants have less
space to bush out laterally and tend to grow
more upright. Clones are set into the flowering room after 1-30 days in the vegetative

Pruning off all lower branches makes inspecting irrigation fittings easy and diminishes
problems associated with weak growth.

room. All the little clones are packed tightly
together in three-gallon pots. Each one of the
plants is taking up the minimum amount of
space for the minimum amount of time to
produce the maximum amount of marijuana.
Light is much more intense, and the entire
plant grows flower tops with few fan leaves.
Most successful growers do not prune at
all, especially if growing a short clone crop
that is only two to three feet (61-91 em) tall.
Short clone crops require no pruning to
increase light to bottom leaves or to alter
their profile. "No pruning" is the easiest and
most productive method when growing
short crops.
Pinching back or pruning tops (branch
tips) causes the two growing shoots just
below the cut to grow stronger and bigger.
This increases the number of top or main
buds. Pruning tops also diffuses fl oral hormones. These hormones (auxins) prevent
the lateral buds from growing very fast All
lower branches develop more rapidly when
the terminal bud is removed. The further a
branch is from hormones at the plant tip, the
less effect the auxins have.
To pinch back a branch tip, simply snip it off
below the last set or two of leaves. Pinching
off tender growth with your fingers helps
seal the wound and is often less damaging
to plants than cutting. When the main stem
is pinched back, side and lower growth is
stimulated. When all the tops are pinched
back, lower growth is encou raged.
Continually pinching back, as when taking
clones from a mother, causes many more little branches to form below the pruned tips.
Eventually, the plant is transformed into a
hedge-like shape. Most growers do not pinch
plants back, because it diminishes the yield
of prime, dense tops; but it may not affect
the overall weight of dried smoke.
Supercropping is a form of pinching back
or pruning branch tips. We are not sure who
or when the term or buz.zword was coined.
We do know that there are several different

versions of supercropping "invented" by

Supercropping can also incorporate FIM

combined with bending, too. Some people
go to the point of mutilating plants by breaking branches a few inches below main buds.
Removing healthy leaves so that "budding
sites get more light" is also practiced by
some supercroppers. See "Stress" below for
more information.
Pruning all the branches or removing more
than 20 percent of the foliage in a short time
frame stresses plants too much and diminishes harvest. But if taking clones, some
growers effectively prune a mother down to
stubby branches and let her recuperate for a
month or longer.
Pruning too much over time may alter hormonal concentrations, causing spindly
growth. This is often the case with mother
plants that provide too many clones. The
mother must rest and gain girth, because
small, spindly branches root poorly.
Remove all but the four main branches.

The meristem (central stem) is removed just

..

above the four lowest (main) branches.
Removing the central leader concentrates
the floral hormones in the four remaining
branches. Fewer branches are stronger and
bear a larger quantity of dense, heavy flower
tops. Remove the stem above the four main
branches; do not remove leaves on the main
branches. Select plants with three sets of
branch nodes about six weeks old, and
pinch or prune out the last set of nodes so
that two sets of branches remain. Move
plants into the flowering room when they
are about 12 inches tall. 'Skunk #1' and similarly robust bloomers should be set in the
flowering room when about six to eight inches tall.
The FIM Technique was coined by an
anonymous High Times reader from South
Carolina in the July 2000 issue of the magazine. The technique has become legendary
on www.overgrow.com, ever since the grower wrote: ''this pruning technique could rev-

The drawing on the left shows the traditional method to top a plant. The entire growing shoot
just below the bud is removed. When the entire growing shoot is removed, the two buds
located directly below the cut grow faster and stronger. The drawing in the center and the
close-up on the right show the FIM pruning technique - the bottom ten percent of the bud
remains intad. This is the key to FIM pruning. Many different flowering tops form as a result
of this single pruning. According to FIM afficionados, terminal buds put on much more weight
and are more dense.

Carolina grower tried to pinch the tip of a
plant and said "Fuel<, I Missed!" when he did
not remove the entire bud and coined the
acronym FIM.

Bending
Bending is similar to pruning, in that it
alters the flow of hormones. Bending efficiently neutralizes the effect of the growthinhibiting hormone. Bending is much easier
on plants than pruning. To bend, lean a
branch in the desired direction and tie it in
place. Branches can take a lot of bending
before they fold over or break. Even if a
branch folds, tie it in place; if necessary, use
a wooden splint. The stem will heal itself.
Young, supple branches take bending much
better than old, stiff ones. Bending branches
horizontally will encourage the buds to grow
vertically towards the light. Each bud will

turn into an impressive top, because they all
receive more light. A wooden planter box
with a lattice trellis alongside makes a great
anchor to tie bent plants to.
Wire ties, the kind used to close bread
sacks, can be purchased at a nursery. Wire
ties are either pre-cut or cut to length by the
grower. Plastic-coated electronic and telephone cable wire also work well. They are
fastened with a simple twist and stay rigid,
leaving the stem breathing room. But if
applied too tightly around a stem, the liquids
cannot flow, and death could result.
Be gentle when bending, even though
cannabis can take much abuse. Sometimes a
crotch will separate or a branch will fold over,
cutting off fluid flow. These mishaps are easily fixed with a small wooden splint snugly
secured with wire ties or duct tape to support the split and broken stem.

Bending plants will give them a low, inconspicuous profile.

Growers also combine bending and pruning. It is easy to prune too much, but it is
hard to over bend.

Air Pruning Roots
When roots grow to the end of the container and are exposed to air, they stop growing.
The air naturally prunes roots. They cannot
grow out the end of the pot, because the climate with little moisture and lots of air is too
inhospitable.

Grafting
little is known about grafting cannabis. Yes,
it is possible to graft cannabis to hops. Most
often the hop stem is grafted to a cannabis
rootstock. The plant will live; however, it will
not produce THC.
I asked a number of growers if they had
experimented with grafting, and none had.
Grafting an indica stem to a large sativa rootstock would be an interesting experiment.

The larger root system could easily supply
water and nutrients to the smaller indica
plant. The resulting plant would be drought
resistant.

Stress
Cannabis grows best and produces heaviest when it is given a stable environment.
Stressed plants produce less than unstressed
plants. Stress-induced trauma include withholding water, photoperiod fluctuation, low
light intensity, ultraviolet light, nutrient toxicities and deficiencies, cold and hot soil,
ambient tempera tures and mutilation. In
addition, any overt applications of growth
hormones such as B9 hormone, gibberellins,

cytokinins, abscisic acid, ethylene, colchicine,
etc., cause stress.
Stress can cause plants to produce more
resin, but it simultaneously causes odd
and/or reduced growth. For example, Felix, a
Swiss outdoor grower, grew a field of
cannabis at 900 feet (300 meters) and
another at 4200 feet (1300 meters). The
upper field suffered stress, because it is
exposed to cooler temperatures and more
ultraviolet radiation. Plants there produce
about 25 percent more resin-packed THC
than plants in the lower field. But, plants that
grow at 900 feet (300 meters) yield at least
25 percent or more dry weight than plants at
the 4200-foot elevation.

Removing large green shade leaves allows
more light to shine on smaller leaves, but it
also causes growth to slow and harvest to
diminish. Remove only leaves that are more
than half damaged by pests or diseases.
Often, partially yellow leaves green up once
stress is eliminated. Removing spindly, dimly
lit lower branches stresses plants much less
than removing leaves to speed growth of
upper foliage.

Water stress slows or stops clones from rooting. If clones have too many leaves and are
too busy transpiring, root growth is very slow.
Conversely, waterlogged rooting mediums

crawl.
Stress can also affect plants'

Life Cycle
Cannabis must flower and produce seeds
to successfully complete its annual life cycle.
Marijuana is a dioecious plant, being either
male (pollen producing) or female (ovule
producing). However, hermaphrodite (bisexual) plants with both male and female flowers can also occur.

rPttmtc grown from seed support symmetrical
rbri~Jnches during seedling and vegetative

growth.

In nature, cannabis flowers in the fall, after
the long hot days of summer. The long nights
and short days of autumn signal marijuana
to start flowering. Plants are normally either
male or female. Cannabis produces male or
female pre-fl owers after four weeks of vegetative growth. For more information, see
''Pre-flowers,'' below.
Growth patterns and chemistry change during nowering: stems elongate; leaves grow progressively fewer blades; cannabinoid production slows at first then accelerates; and nower
formation is rapid at first then slows. Nutrient
needs change as growth stages change. Plants

requiring much nitrogen, slows. Phosphorus
and potassium uptake increase to promote floral formation. Shortly before the flowering
stage, growers change to a "super bloom" fertilizer formula with less nitrogen and more
potassium and phosphorus.
Induce flowering in greenhouses, outdoors,
and indoors by giving plants more hours of
total darkness and fewer hours of light. Give
cannabis 12 hours of uninterrupted darkness
and 12 hours of light to induce visible signs
of flowering in two weeks or less. This program is effective in all but the latest blooming pure saliva strains. Growers with a vegetative room illuminated 18-24 hours a day
and a flowering room with 12-hour days and
12-hour nights, create environments that
mimic the photoperiod in summer and fall.
With this simple combination, growers crank

out a crop of outstanding buds every six to
ten weeks all year long.
Inducing flowering in cannabis grown from
seed with a 12/12 day/night photoperiod
will cause plants to show sex, male or
female. Once the sex of the plant is guaranteed, males are almost always harvested
before they shed pollen, and females are
coaxed into higher yields. Once the photoperiod is set, disrupting it will cause plants to
suffer stress. If they suffer enough stress, hermaphrodite tendencies increase.
Water intake of flowering plants is usually
somewhat less than in the vegetative stage.
Adequate water during flowering is important for plants to carry on internal chemistry
and resin production. Withholding water to
"stress" a plant will actually stunt growth and
diminish yield.
Removing large fan leaves to allow more
intense light to reach small buds or to stress
plants is crazy! Large leaves are necessary to
keep plants healthy. Indoors and in greenhouses where the hours of darkness are controlled, cannabis flowers for six to ten weeks
or longer. This is a very short time. Hacking
off branch tips to initiate more budding sites
diffuses floral hormones and retards growth.
Remove only leaves that are 50 percent or
more damaged by diseases, pests, and cultural practices.
Upon pollination, one of the many, tiny
grains of pollen from the male (staminate)
flower pod, lands on a pistil of the female
(pistillate) flower. Female flower tops are a
mass of calyxes with each calyx harboring an
ovule
and a protruding set of pistils. Actual
•
fertilization takes place when the grain of
male pollen slides down the pistil and unites
with the female ovule deep within the
female calyx. Once fertilization takes place,
pistils turn brown and a seed forms within
the seed bract. Seeds are the result of this
sexual propagation and contain genetic characteristics of both parents. In nature there is

a SO/SO chance for a seed to produce a male
or female plant. Once fertilized with male
pollen, female plants put the bulk of their
energy into producing strong, viable seeds.
When flowers are full of ripe, mature seeds,
the female will die, having successfully completed her life cycle. The male completes his
life cycle and dies after producing and dispersing all of his pollen into the wind, in
search of receptive female pistils.

Pre-flowering
Pre-flowers, described by Robert Clarke in
Marijuana Botany as "primordial," are the
first indication of a plant's sex. The pre-flowers grow at branch internodes just behind
the leaf spur or stipule about the fourth week
of vegetative growth, when the plant is six to
eight weeks old. This is the point of sexual
maturity, the first sign a plant is preparing for
flowering-the next stage in life.
You can see pre-flowers with the naked
eye, but a 10 to 30X magnifier will make
viewing easier. You can accurately determine
plant sex after eight weeks. Using this
method, you can distinguish sex before
inducing flowering.

Male
Male Pre-flowering
Male pre-flowers are normally visible when
plants are six to eight weeks old, after the
fourth week of vegetative growth. The preflowers emerge behind the stipule at the
fourth to fifth branch internodes and generally do not turn into full flowers. But, according to Bongaloid (lllll!llW.Oltergrow.com), "a
male plant will develop mature staminate
flowers after prolonged periods of vegetative
growth."

hours of light before pre-flowers develop will
stress the plant. This stress could cause peculiar growth, and plants might develop into
hermaphrodites. Inducing flowering before
pre-flowers form will not expedite flowering.
In fact, flowering will occur at about the
same time as if you had waited for preflowers to show!
Plants grown from seed under an 18/6
day/night photoperiod will generally show
pre-flowers before plants that are given a
24/0 day/night photoperiod. Once preflowers are distinguishable as male or
female, plants can be induced to flower with
a 12/12 day/night photoperiod.

(www.overgrow.com): "Do not try to sex a
seedling based on the very first pre-flower.
Wait and make sure. The time between using
a 25X (Ioupe) to spot the very first pre-flower
and the plant dropping pollen is at least 10+
days away, so it's safe."

Male Flowering

Males are usually taller than females and
have stout stems, sporadic branching, and
fewer leaves. In nature, wind and gravity
carry pollen from taller males to fertilize (pollinate) receptive females. Male plants produce fewer flowers than females, because
one male plant can pollinate many females.
Males also contain less THC and overall
lower cannabinoid levels.
Males fertilize females, causing them to
stop high THC production and start seed formation. Remove and destroy males, except
those used for breeding, as soon as their sex
has been determined. The instant they show
sex, separate male plants used for breeding
from females. Do not let them shed pollen.
Premature pollen sacks often form and open
early or are hidden under foliage and go
unnoticed until it is too late. If growing from
seed, take special care to ferret out male
flowers and plants.
Growers have reported that bouncing the
photoperiod around and dynamically raising
or lowering the temperature have the effect
of producing more male plants. Note that
each stimulus involves creating a climate that

When given a 12/12 day/night photoperiod, male cannabis reaches maturity and
flowers one to two weeks before females.
However, male plants do not necessarily
need a 12/12 day/night photoperiod to
dawn flowers and shed pollen. Males can
flower under long days and short nights as
well, but they generally produce fewer flowers. Once male calyxes show, pollen develops quickly and can disperse within a very
short time. There is always an early opener
that sheds pollen, often within 24 hours or
less! To avoid pollination problems, remove
males as soon as they are distinguished. If
growing male plants, always isolate them
from femal es, so they will not be pollinated.
See Chapter 5, "Harvest," for more information on harvesting males.

stage, which ensu res pollination. If you are
making seeds, pollinating femal es too early,
before the girls have developed many receptive female pistils, will result in a small seed
crop. See Chapter Seventeen, ''Breeding," for
more information.
Male fl owers are about one quarter-inch (6
mm) long and pastel green to yellowish in
color. Flowers first develop near the top of
the plant. Pollen sacks develop on a short
spike and hang in clusters at the base of
branches. Gradually, flowers develop
towards the bottom of the plant. After two to
six weeks of the 12-hour photoperiod, fully

causes plants to suffer stress. Also, the stressful environment does not necessarily turn
the entire plant male; it turns it hermaphrodite. The most susceptible plants already
have a predisposition to hermaphrodism.
See Chapter Sixteen, "Breeding," for more
information.
There are several ways to promote male or
female plants during seedling growth. (See
"Grow More Female Plants from Seed" in
Chapter Two). During vegetative growth you
can get a good idea of a plant's sex from its
genetic background and growth characteristics. The most dependable way to deduce
sex is ''Cloning for Sex" (see Chapter Three).

Sixteen, "Breeding."

Female Pre-flowering

The pre--flower on this 'Mr. Bubble' female is
""'n' easy to spot with the naked eye.

Pre-flowers on this 'Puna Budder' from
TH~iee(ts are nearing the end of the pre-flowering stage that lasts about two weeks.

Near the end of normal vegetative growth,
plants grown from seed develop pre-flowers.
This is when female calyx formation initiates,
and it is not contingent upon photoperiod. It
occurs when a plant is old enough to show
signs of sexual maturity, about the fourth
week of vegetative growth, or six to eight
weeks from germination. The pre-flowers
emerge behind the stipule at the fourth to
fifth branch internodes.
A pre-flower looks like a regular female
flower; most have a pair of white fuzzy pistils.
Pistils normally form after the light green
seed bract part of the pre-flower has formed.
Wait until pistils have formed to ensure the
plant is a female and not a male. The preflowering stage lasts from one to two weeks.
A little patience is in order now!
Plants grown from seed under an 18/6
day/night photoperiod will usually show pronounced pre-flowers before plants given a
24/0 day/night photoperiod. And, under a
16/8 day/night regimen pre-flowers show
more quickly and are often more

pronounced. Once pre-flowers are distinguishable as male or female, plaots can be
induced to flower with a 12/12 day/night
photoperiod.
Always wait to induce flowering until after
pre-flowers appear. Inducing flowering with
12 hours of uninterrupted darkness and 12
hours of light before pre-flowers develop will
stress the plant. This stress could cause odd
growth, and plants might grow into hermaphrodites. Inducing flowering before preflowers form will not speed flowering.
Flowering will occur about the same time as
if you had waited for pre-flowers to show!

Female Flowering
Female cannabis is prized for heavy, potent
resin production and weighty flower yield.
Ideal female plants grow squat and bushy
with branches close together on the stem
and dense foliage on branches. In most
strains, the first signs of female flowers
appear one to three weeks after inducing
flowering with the 12-hour photoperiod.
Female flowers initially appear near the top
of the terminal bud and gradually develop on
lower branches starting at the tips and moving downward. Flowers have two small onequarter to one-half inch (6-12 mm) fuzzy,
white hairs, called pistils that form a "V." The
set of pistils is attached at the base to an
ovule, which is contained in a light green
pod, called a calyx. Pistil-packed calyxes form
dense clusters or buds along stems. A cluster
of buds is often called a top or cola. The
masses of calyxes develop rapidly for the first
four or five weeks, after which they grow at a
slower rate. Buds put on much of their harvest weight as they swell during the last two
or three weeks of growth. Pure sativas,
including Thai varieties, can flower for four
months or longer! Once the ovule has been
fertilized by male pollen, rapid calyx formation and resin production slow, and seed
growth starts.

'Flo' in early flowering

When females' flowering is at their zenith,
pistils swell and swell. Soon they change in
color, most often from white to amber and,
eventually, to reddish brown.

Sinsemilla
Sinsemilla (pronounced sin-semiya) is
derived from two Spanish words: "sin" =
without and "semilla" = seed. Sinsemilla is
the word that describes flowering female
cannabis tops that have not been fertilized
by male pollen.
Highly pri zed sinsemilla buds are the most
potent part of any strain, with a proportionately large volume of THC per flower bud,

and it's all smoke, no seeds!
Unpollinated female plants
continue to flower until calyx
forma tion and resin production peak out, six to ten weeks
after turning the lights to 12
hours. During six to ten weeks
of flowering, calyxes develop
and swell along the stem,
yielding more high quality
buds than pollinated, seeded
flowers.
Make any female marijuana
sinsemilla by removing male
plants as soon as they are
identified. Removing males virtually guarantees that male
pollen will not fertilize succulent female pistils. Sometimes
a few early grains of pollen are
shed by premature male flowers. Pollen dispersed from wild
or cultivated male cannabis
plants could also be floating in
the air. Sometimes a hermaphrodite with a few male fl owers
will sprout on a predominately
female plant. See
"Hermaphrodites''
in Chapter Sixteen,
Breeding.

marijuana in mint condition, store it in a dark,
airtight, glass container, and place it in the refrigerator. Ordinary canning jars allow buds to be
admired as well as protected. Glass containers
do not impart any plastic or metal odors and
contain the pungent fragrance of fresh marijuana buds. Placing an orange or lemon peel in the

Curing allows buds to continue to dry slowly.
The first week of curing affects potency in that it
evenly removes moisture within the bud so virtually all the THC is psychoactive. Curing also
allows buds to dry enough that mold does not
grow when buds are stored. Well-cured buds
have an even glow when burned and smoke
smooth.
After plants, branches, and/ or buds have dried
on screens or hung in a drying room for five to
seven days and appear to be dry, they still contain moisture inside. This moisture affects taste
and potency. Curing will remove this excess
moisture. Curing makes the bud uniformly dry
and converts virtually all THC into its psychoactive form.
Cut stems into manageable lengths- less than
12-18 inches (30-45 cm)- and place them in an
airtight container. Airtight glass containers with
<1 rubber or similar seal are the best. Avoid
Ziploc and other plastic bags that are not airtight. Plastic bags used for long-term storage are
airtight. The "reflection anti-detection barrier foil
bags" available from Hy Supply (www.hY.
&~RRIY..nD are airtight and infrared-proof. Some
growers avoid plastic containers such as

buds. But when curing large amounts, such
plastic bins are the best option because stuffing
10 pounds (4.5 kg) or more into small canning
jars would be laborious and impractical.
Enclose buds in a container to create a microclimate that allows moisture to even out within
the buds. Internal moisture will migrate to the
dry portions of the bud. Gently pack as many
buds into container as possible without forcing
and damaging them. Leave the containers in a
cool, dry, dark place. Check in two to four hours
to see if buds have "sweated" moisture. Check
buds by gently squeezing to feel if they are
moister than they were a few hours before. Be
careful when squeezing buds; resin glands
bruise easily.
If stems fold instead of snapping when bent,
and buds are still moist to the touch, remove
them from the container and gently place in the
bottom of a paper bag. They can be stacked in
the paper bag as high as six inches (15 em).
Fold the top of the bag once or twice to close.
Check the buds two to three times during the
day to monitor drying. Carefully turn them in the
bag so that different sides are exposed. Remove
when they are dry and place back into the
sealed container. Check them the next day to
see if they are evenly dry. Stems should snap
when bent. If too moist, put them back in the
paper bag until dry. When dry, return to the curing container.
If buds appear to have fairly low moisture content, and stems snap when bent, leave them in
the container and let excess moisture escape
out the top. Open the container for a few minutes every few hours to let the excess moisture
escape before closing the lid again. At this point
you can add an orange or lemon peel to the
container to impart a slight citrus aroma.
Check the container several times daily. Leave
the top off for five to ten minutes so moisture
evacuates. Depending upon moisture content,
buds should be totally dry in a few days to two
weeks. Once they are evenly dry, they are ready
to seal in an airtight container for storage.

Lay small buds in a box to dry. Tum them claily to promore even drying and prevent mold.

Fast Drying

Freeze Drying

Here are six ways to dry buds quickly. Remember, buds that
dry quickly burn hot; the smoke is harsh, and l'hey taste
"green" when smoked.
One: Manicure fresh buds and remove all branches. Spread
them out evenly and wrap in paper or enclose in an envelope. Place the paper or envelope on a warm refrigerator,
radiator, television, etc. Depending upon heat level, buds will
be dry in a few hours to overnight. Buds will be a bit crispy
when dry. Place buds in an airtight container until they sweat.
Put back in the paper and dry until dehydrated enough to
burn well.
Two: Cut up fresh buds and/or foliage. Place on a 12-inch
(30 em) square of tinfoil. Hold or place it over a 60-100-watt
light bulb. Stir every 15-30 seconds. It will be dry enough to
smoke in one to three minutes.
Three: Place diced buds and/ or foliage on a cookie sheet in
an oven at l SO"F (65°C) for 10-15 minutes. Check regularly
and stir if needed until dry. Do not increase temperature
above 200°F (93°C) or the THC will vaporize into the air.
Four: Place cut up buds and/or foliage in a microwave
oven. Turn the microwave on in short, weak (50 percent
power) bursts of I 5-30 seconds each. Recycle until dry, and
stir if necessary.
Five: Cut buds and/or foliage into small pieces, and place
in a glass jar with an airtight lid. Place several silica gel desiccant packs (the kind that come with electronic devices and
camera s) into the glass jar and seal. Moisture will migrate to
the silica gel in a few hours. Remove the packets and dry
using dry heat source. Replace silica packs until marijuana is
dry enough to smoke. Find silica
gel packs at auto parts or electronics stores.
Six: Drying buds in a food dehydrator for 24-48 hours is the next
best option. Food dehydrators are
a series of stackable screens.
Place bud and leaf on screens
and stack. A fan blows air gently
upward to dry the marijuana
quickly. One friend used this technique and the buds smoked OK,
but it was the only dope around,
and this could have colored my
taste perceptions!

Dry ice is frozen carbon
dioxide. When it warms,
co, converts from a frozen
solid to a gas, without turning into a liquid. When
moist marijuana is enclosed
with dry ice (frozen C0 2) at
virtually zero relative humidity, water molecules migrate
from the cannabis to the dry
ice. This causes the relative
humidity of the CO, to
increase and the moisture
content of the marijuana to
decrease. This process
occurs below 32°F (o•q,
and it preserves cannabis.
Place equal amounts of
dry ice and bud into a container. Put the dry ice on the
bottom and bud on top.
Seal with a lid. Make a few
small holes in the lid of the
container for excess gas to
exit. Place in your kitchen
freezer. Check every 12-24
hou•·s. When the dry ice is
gone, the buds should be
completely d•y. If not dry,
add more dry ice until
cannabis is dry. Conserve
dry ice by partially drying
buds for a few days before
enclosing with dry ice.
This method
retains
potency and freshness and
causes very little degradation of resin glands from
heat, light·, air, and fondling
hands. The smoke has a
mint-like taste because the
chlorophyll does not break
down.

Ct,.al>ter FIVE

HARVEST

To find the approximate moisture content of
dry buds, weigh a specific bud upon harvest
when it is wet. Weigh it again during the drying
and curing process to learn how much moisture
it has lost. For example, a bud that weighs 10
grams (0.36 oz) upon harvest. will weigh 2.5
grams (0.09 oz) when it ~as lost 75 percent of
its moisture. In general, a dry bud will weigh 75
percent less than its wet weight at harvest.
'

Packaging and Storage
Storing cannabis · in an airtight environment
will preserve aroma, taste, and potency. Use a
vacuum sealer to evacuate air in glass jars.
Inexpensive vacuum sealers are available in the
canning section of grocery and variety stores.
Growers report that containers sealed with inexpensive vacuum sealers lose the vacuum after a
few days. More expensive vacuum sealers such
as the one available at www.<!eni.t;Qm work
much better. When properly vacuum-packed,
buds will stay as fresh the day they were sealed
in the airtight jar.
Vacuum seal the jar, and place it in the refrigerator for storage. Leave it in the refrigerator or
a cool, dark, dry place for a month or longer. The
taste and potency will be tops! Refrigeration
slows decomposition, but, remember, refrigera·
tors have a high humidity level, so the container
must be sealed airtight. I just checked the relative humidity and temperature in my refrigerator- 55 percent relative humidity and s•c (40°F).
Do not place it in the freezer. Freezing draws
moisture to the surface of buds, which can harm
resin glands on the surface.
Place sealed containers in a cool, dry, dark
place. Some growers prefer to keep airtight,
sealed containers in the refrigerator. If the seal is
not airtight, the low temperature in the refrigerator creates a condition of high humidity. Dry
buds stored in a container that is not airtight
attract moisture in the high-humidity environment. Before long, the buds are so moist that
they must be dried again.

Seed Crops

Buds are bagged after weighing.

Harvest seed crops when seeds are big and
ripe. Often, seeds actually split open their containing seed bract. Flowering females grow
many ready, receptive calyxes until pollination
occurs. Seeds are fully mature within six to eight
weeks. Once pollinated, the majority of the
female's energy is directed toward seed production. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content is
usually of minimum importance. Seed crops can
be left in the ground until seeds "ra ttle in the
pod," but most growers harvest them before
then. Watch for and control insects, mites, and
fungus that attack the weakening female and
her cache of ripe seeds.
Home breeders often pollinate only one or
two branches. The unpollinated branches are
sinsemilla. The sinsemilla tops are harvested
when ripe. Seeded branches continue to mature
for another week or two until ripe. When seeds
are mature, remove them from the pods by rubbing seeded buds between your hands over a

Store seeds in a cool, dry, dark place. The
seeds are viable and ready for planting as soon
as they are harvested, but they may grow sickly

before planting. Seeds with a hard outer cask
are the most likely to sprout and grow well. See

Introduction
The payoff for all the research, work, risk,
expense, and the long, patient wait is a bountiful harvest. Strong, healthy, well-grown clones
and seedlings yield the heaviest harvests. A wellorganized pre-harvest and harvest are essential
to preserve cannabis quality and decrease the
workload.
Harvest when plants are at peak ripeness.
Depending upon the high you like, which is discussed below, harvest timing is critical. The peak
harvest window is open for about five to seven
days.
Once harvested, most growers manicure buds
before drying them slowly and evenly so THC is
preserved. After drying, buds should cure to
achieve full aroma and flavor. Like a fine wine,
aging or curing improves taste and fragrance.
Once cured, proper storage will ensure buds
retain all of their essential qualities.
This 'Thoitonic' is not ready for harvest. The white pistils ore jusr starling to tum color.

Tl1is 'TI1aitonic' is at·the point of lwrvesr. Note that
many of the pistils are tuming color.

Before Harvest
Fragrance is often a problem before, during,
and after harvest. Control fragrance by keeping
drying and manicuring rooms well-vented. If
possible, allow plenty of fresh circulating air to
pass through the drying room to remove odors
quickly. If air in and around drying and manicuring room is stagnant, odors linger and accumulate. Keep temperatures below 70°F (21 °C) so
essential oils in cannabis do not volatize and
release pleasant but unwanted fragrances.
Contain cannabis fragrance in sealed drying and
manicuring rooms. Filter air before expelling
with a carbon filter. See "Odor" in Chapter
Thirteen for more information on controlling fragrance.
Avoid the taste of organic or chemical fertilizers in harvested buds by flushing with plain
water or a clearing solution to remove any residuals and chemicals that have built up in soil or
plant foliage. Ten to fourteen days before harvesting, flush the garden with distilled water or
water treated with reverse osmosis. Use a clearing solution such as Final Flush® if you have to

_,)

...:

Chapter FlVE
use plain tap water that contains dissolved
solids. Some growers fertilize until three to four
days before harvest and use a clearing solution
to remove fertilizer residues. Apply this water
just as you would apply nutrient solution.
Always let at least ten percent, preferably more,
drain out the bottom of containers. If using a
recirculating hydroponic system, change the
water after the first four to six days of application. Continue to top off the reservoir with
"clean" water.
How to tell when fertilizer will affect taste.
I . Leaf tips and fringes are burned.
2. Leaves are brittle at harvest.
3. Buds crackle when burning.
4. Buds smell like chemicals.
s. Buds taste like fertilizer.
Do not water for one or two days before harvest. The soil should be fairly dry, but not dry
enough that plants wilt. This will speed drying
time by a day or more and not affect the quality of the end product.

Harvest
Growth stops at harvest and the THC content
cannot increase. It will stay the same or
decrease after harvest. Proper handling is the
key to retaining THC potency. Prolonged periods
of light, temperatures above 80"F (27"C), friction
from fondling hands, and damp, humid conditions should be avoided because they all
degrade the THC.
The THC chemical is produced in leaves, flowers, and stalked glandular trichomes, lovingly
referred to as "resin glands" or simply "tri chomes." Stems and roots may smell like they
should be smoked, but contain few mind-bending cannabinoids, if any, and the resin is not very
psychoactive. Male plants contain much less
THC and are harvested before they pollinate
females. Female plants are harvested when trichomes show peak ripeness. Leaves are harvested first.

HARVEST

Manicuring plants takes a long rime. One pound
(454 gm) takes four ro six hourS>to manicure by
hand with scissors and one to two hour to manicure
with on automatic trimmer.

Growers hang plants upside down because it
is simple, convenient, and effective; not to drain
existing THC-potent resin into the buds. Also,
boiling roots to extract THC is crazy!

Leaves
Once the large leaves are fully formed, THC
potency has generally peaked out. Smaller
leaves around buds continue to develop resin
until buds are ripe. Peak potency is retained, as
long as leaves are healthy and green; nothing is
lost by leaving them on the plant. Harvest leaves
if they show signs of disease or rapid yellowing
that fertilizer has failed to cure. Once they start
to yellow and die, potency decreases somewhat. This is true especially with fan leaves that
grow before the buds. The large leaves turn yel·
low when nitrogen-rich fertilizer is withheld dur·
ing flowering.
Cut the entire leaf, including the leaf stem
(petiole) and toss it into a bag. Paper bags
breathe well and can be closed by folding over
the top. Plastic bags do not breathe, so the top
must be left open. If the petiole is left on the
stem, it shrivels and dies back. This little bit of
dead plant attracts moisture and mold.
Removing it will avoid mold problems.
Keep the paper bag in a closet or area with
40·60 percent humidity and 60-70"F (15-21"C)
temperature. Reach into the bag once or twice a

Male flowers can produce pollen as early as
two weeks after changing lights to the 12-hour
day/night schedule. Watch out for early openers. Three to six weeks after initiating fl owering,
pollen sacks open and continue producing flowers for several weeks after the first pods have
begun to shed pollen. Once male flowers are
clearly visible but not yet open, THC production
is at peak levels. (See "Sinsemilla Harvest"
below for information on trichome glands.) This
is the best time to harvest. Once males release
pollen, the degradation process speeds up and
flowers fall.
Harvest males carefully, especially if close to
females. Cut the plant off at the base, taking
care to shake it as little as possible. To help prevent accidental pollination by an unnoticed
open male flower, carefully cover the male plant
with a plastic bag, and tie it off at the bottom
before harvesting. Or, if you can see an open
pollen sack, spray it with water to make pollen
unviable. Keep males used for breeding as far
from flowering females as possible. Make sure
to install fine screens for air coming into the
flowering room and wet them down regularly to
discourage rogue pollen. Isolate males until
needed. After a month, the male will start

retains viable sacks of pollen. Males can also be
cloned and held in the vegetative stage until
needed. Induce flowering about three weeks
before viable pollen is needed. Within three to
five weeks, the male will be full of viable pollen
sacks.
Prolong male harvest by removing flowers
with tweezers or fingernails as they appear. New
flowers soon emerge after plucking old ones.
Continue to remove pollen sacl<s until females
are two weeks from full bloom. Picking off individual male flowers is a tedious, time consuming process, and it is easy to miss a few.
Harvesting most of the branches, leaving only
one or two pollen-bearing limbs, is practical. A
single male flower contains enough pollen to
fertilize many female ovules; a single branch full
of male flowers is necessary to produce enough
pollen for most horne breeding needs.

Sinsemilla Harvest
Sinsemilla flowers are mature from 6-12
weeks after the photoperiod has been changed
to 12 hours. The best time to harvest sinsemilla
is when THC production has peaked but not yet
started the degradation process. Established
indoor varieties are bred so the entire plant

after inducing flowering, while indica crosses
with more dominant sativas, such as 'Skunk 4t 1',
may not be ready for ten weeks. Commercial
growers often pick immature six-week-old buds
so they can harvest one more crop every year.
Pure sativa varieties, especially Thai and Asian
strains that were grown from native seed, take
longer to bloom after turning the light to 12
hours. They could take four months to finish
blooming! These types tend to form buds at an
even rate throughout flowering with no marked
decline in growth rate. Few indoor growers
have the time or patience to grow pure sativa

varieties because of their long flowering period,
leggy stature, and low yield. Buds at the top of
the plant often reach peak potency a few days
to a couple of weeks before lower buds. Longblooming equatorial sativas may require several harvests.
Pistils turn from white to brown or brownishred as the flower tops ripen. Pistils changing
color indicates plants are turning ripe; however,
it is not the best indicator of peak ripeness. After
more hands-on research, I have learned that it
is difficult to tell peak ripeness by the color of
pistils in all strains. The best gauge of peak
ripeness is the color of the resin glands or trichomes.
Resin glands change colors as they ripen. At
first, glands are clear. As they continue to
mature, they turn a translucent milky color and,
finally, they turn amber. Resin glands that are
bruised from being squeezed or jostled about
deteriorate quickly. All glands do not change

A

trichome is a "plant hair." The trichomes found on drug cannabis are glandular and
secretory in character. These stalked glandular trichomes are comprised of a stalk with a
resin head. They look like a post with the knob at the top. They form on buds and small
leaves. The highest concentration of THC is located at the base of the resin head. The
best time to harvest is when these trichomes have developed a spherical head and are
still transparent. Senescing glands start to turn brown and get smaller; they are decomposing, and THC content diminishes. Check buds every day starting the sixth week of
flowering. Check several buds from different plants to ensure the maximum amount of
trichomes are ripe for harvest.
Cystolith trichom es have a pointed tip and are often long and hair-like. These protective trichomes are most common on leaf undersides.
Cystolith glands exude insecticidal and miticidal substances
to gum up pest mouthparts
and repel them, but they have
no THC.

Harvest when the majority of trichomes have
turned amber for a body stone. Pure indica,
afghani, and indica-dominant strains harvested
at this late point will possess a heavy body, or
couch-lock, stone. Waiting to harvest pure sativa
and sativa-dominant varieties until this stage
will not take advantage of the strains. Such
strains are best harvested when resin glands are
clear to milky colored.

Harvest Step-by-Step
Step One: Stop fertilization seven to ten days
prior to harvest. Latent nutrient accumulation in
foliage imparts a fertilizer-like taste. Leach nutrients from the growing medium seven to ten
days before harvest. Some growers continue to
fertilize until three days before harvest if using a
product such as Final Flush®. Such products
expedite flushing built-up chemicals from
cannabis plants.
Step l'wo: If sprays have been applied during
the last week (not recommended), mist plants
heavily to wash off undesirable residues that
may have accumulated on foliage. The bath will
not affect resin production. Gently jiggle buds
after rinsing to shake off any standing water. To
prevent fungus and bud blight, wash the garden
early in the day to allow excess water on leaves
to dry before nightfall. If bud mold (botrytis) is a
threat, DO NOT wash buds.
Step Three: You may want to give plants 24
hours of total darkness before harvest. Many
growers do this and say the buds are a little
more resinous afterward.
Step Four: Harvest in the morning when THC
content is at its peak. Harvest entire plant or one
branch at a time by cutting near the base with
pruners. Jerking the root ball creates a mess and
is unnecessary. All of the THC is produced in the
foliage, not in the roots.

94

Step Five: It is not necessary to hang plants
upside down so all the resin drains into the
foliage. Once formed, resin does not move .
However, drying the entire plant by hanging it
upside down is very convenient. When stems
are left intact, drying is much slower.
Step Six: To harvest entire plants and/or
branches:
a. Remove large leaves one or two days
before actually cutting the plants down.
Or remove leaves after cutting plants.
Harvesting large leaves early gets them
out of the way and makes manicuring
easier and faster.
b. Harvest entire plants by cutting them off
at the base before manicuring.
c. Or cut each branch into lengths of 6-24
inches. Manicure the freshly harvested
tops, trimming away leaves with clippers
or scissors. Hang the manicured branches
until dry. Once dry, cut the tops from the
branches, taking special care to handle
tender buds as gently as possible.
d. Or leave larger leaves on branches to act
as a protective sheath to flower buds.
Tender resin glands are protected from
bruises and rupture until final manicuring,
but, manicuring is much slower and more
tedious when trimming dry foliage.

Manicuring
Once harvested, carefully manicure buds by
cutting large leaves where they attach to the
•
stem. Leaving the petiole (leaf stem) can cause
mold to grow. Snip off smaller, low-potency
leaves around buds that show little resin, so a
beautiful THC-potent bud remains.
Manicuring is easiest when leaves are soft and
supple immediately after harvest. Trimming off
leaves now will also speed drying. Waiting until
foliage is dry to manicure will make manicuring
buds a tedious, time-consuming job.
Manicuring is easiest with a good pair of trimming scissors that has small blades to facilitate
reaching in and snipping off leaf petioles at the

-----

Chapter FIVE

main stem. An ergonomic pair of scissors with
comfortable handles is indispensable when
manicuring cannabis for hours.
Manicure over a fine silkscreen (see Chapter
15, "Hash") or a glass table. Scrape up fallen
resin glands on the table or under the screen.
This potent resin can be smoked immediately or
pressed into blocks of hash.
Wear inexpensive rubber gloves to collect "finger hash." After trimming for a few hours,
remove accumulated finger hash on gloves by
bathing in a small portion of isopropyl alcohol.
Set the hash-laden alcohol on the counter
overnight to evaporate. Scrape up the remaining
hash after all the alcohol has evaporated. Or put
the rubber gloves in a freezer for a few hours.
Cooling will make it easier to scrape and rub the
accumulated hash from the gloves.
Scrape accumulated resin from scissors when
it impairs blade movement. Use a small knife to
remove built-up resin from blades. Ball up small
bits of scraped resin by rubbing it together
between fingers. The ball of hash will grow as
mamcunng progresses.
Budget enough time to harvest and manicure
your crop. Properly manicuring one pound (454

scissors and one to two hours when using an
automatic trimmer.

After harvest, marijuana must dry before

juana will not be very potent. Drying also converts 75 percent or more of the freshly harvested plant into water vapor and other gases.
When you cut a plant or plant part and hang it
to dry, the transport of fluids within the plant
continues, but at a slower rate. Stomata close
soon after harvest, and drying is slowed since little water vapor escapes. The natural plant
processes slowly come to an end as the plant
dries. The outer cells are the first to dry, but fluid
still moves from internal cells to supply moisture
to outer cells which are dry. When this process
occurs properly, plants dry evenly throughout.
Removing leaves and large stems upon harvest
speeds drying; however, moisture content within the "dried" buds, leaves, and stems is uneven.
If buds are dried too quickly, chlorophyll and
other pigments, starch, and nitrates are trapped
within plant tissue, making it taste "green," burn
unevenly, and taste bad.
When dried relatively slowly, over five to seven
days or longer, moisture evaporates evenly into
the air, yielding uniformly dry buds with minimal
THC decomposition. Slowly dried buds taste
sweet and smoke smooth. Taste and aroma
improve when pigments break down. Slow

Hanging plants is a labor-saving way to facilitate slow, even drying. Large, moist stems can

Use clothespins to attach branches to drying

obscure corner of a basement, where the
temperature is easy to keep constant year
round. Basements are well insulated by concrete walls and soil. A basement room can
be enclosed and camouflaged with junk, a
double wall, workbench, or shelving.
Added security is afforded by installing a
false door in a closet. The grow room is
located behind the secret door. Another
good secret location, except for the possible
heat build-up, is the attic. Few people venture to an attic that is difficult to access.
Some growers locate their gardens below a
trapdoor covered with a rug.
Law enforcement cannot use the electricity
bill as sole grounds for a search warrant. But,
they can use it along with other "evidence''
such as remnants of indoor growing visible
outdoors, thermal image heat signatures,
snitch testimony, etc., to secure a search warrant. As long as the marijuana grown is not
sold or shown to a snitch, there should be
no reason for any suspicion. Thermal image
technology is easy to outwit. Just keep the
lights on during daylight hours to confuse
the technology. Or, cool exhaust air and
expel it under the well-insulated grow house
so it does not leave a heat trail.

This cutaway basement grow room shows a
real scenario. Plants on tables stay warmer
and are easy to maintain.

Outbuildings, garages, and barns not
attached to homes are some of the worst
places to grow cannabis. Thieves and law
enforcement often do not regard entering a
barn or garage as a crime, though they
would not consider entering a home.
Security is much better when the garden is
within the home.
Although less common, there are even
grow rooms on wheels! Some innovative
growers have remodeled trailer houses and
buses into grow rooms. One of my favorite
grow rooms was in a tricked-out trailer.
Another was in a 60-foot (18 m) sailing
yacht!
The grow room's size determines the size
and the number of lamps. High intensity discharge (HID) lamps that work well to grow
marijuana are available in wattages of 150,
175, 250, 400, 600, 1000, and 1100. Smaller
wattages from 150-400, work well in closets
or spaces with 9-21 square feet (0.8-2 m2) of
floor space. Use 600-watt and larger bulbs
for larger areas.
The drawings show several grow room
floor plans. As the floor plans demonstrate,
there are several basic approaches to grow
room design and production. Most growers
start out with a crop grown in a single room.
After they harvest the crop, they introduce a
new batch of clones. The photoperiod is
switched back to 18 hours, and the cycle
continues.
The most productive setups utilize two
rooms. The first room is for vegetative
growth, mother plants, and rooting clones.
This room should be about one-quarter the
size of the flowering room. When the flowering room crop is harvested, plants from the
vegetative room are moved into the flower.mg room.
Super productivity is achieved with a perpetual crop. Several clones are taken every
day or every week. Every day a few plants are
harvested. For every plant harvested, a new
cutting takes its place.

This indoor setup has a big flowering room, a

This productive grow room is located in a
closed-off comer of the basement.

Setting Up the Grow RoomStep-by-Step

Take a little time to set up your grow room so
all the space is used efficiently.

This closet grow room has everything necessary to grow a crop-lights, fans, and
cannabis! A 400-watt HID lights the 3 x 4foot (90 x 120 em) flowering room above, and
two 55-watt CFLs in one reflector illuminate
mothers and clones in this perpetual harvest
setup.

A single 1000-watt metal halide can grow
enough mothers, clones, and vegetative
plants to support 4000 watts of flowering HID
light. This design allows pungent odors to waft
upward before being evacuated via roof fans.
A third area in the attic is used as a heot
buffer in hot climates.

Set up the grow room before introducing
plants. Construction requires space and
planning. A grow room under construction
offers a terrible environment for plants. Once
the grow room is set up and totally operational, it will be ready for plants.
Step One: Choose an out-of-the-way space
with little or no traffic. A corner of the basement or a spare bedroom are perfect. A
1000-watt HID, properly set up, will efficiently illuminate up to a 6 x 6-foot (1.8 x 1.8 m)
room. The ceiling should be at least five feet
(1.5 m) high. Keep in mind that plants in
containers are set up at least one foot (30
em) off the ground, and the lamp needs
about a foot (30 em) of space to hang from
the ceiling. This leaves only three feet (90
em) of space for plants to grow. If forced to
grow in an attic or basement with a low fourfoot (120 em) ceiling, much can be done to
compensate for the loss of height, including
cloning, bending, pruning, and using smaller
wattage lamps.
Step Two: Enclose the room, if not already
enclosed. Remove everything that does not
pertain to the garden. Furni ture, drapes, and
curtains may harbor fungi. An enclosed
room allows easy, precise control of every-

thing and everyone that enters or exits, as
well as who and what goes on inside. For
most growers, enclosing the grow room is
simply a matter of tacking up some plywood
or fabricating plastic walls in the basement
or attic and painting the room flat white.
Make sure no light is visible from outside. If
covering a window, do so discreetly-it
should not look boarded up. Insulate windows and walls so a telltale heat signature
does not escape. Basement windows often
are painted to look like the foundation. Place
some stuff-books, personal effects, household goods, etc.-in front of the window, and
build a box around the things so a natural
scene is visible from the outside. At night,
bright light leaking through a crack in an
uncovered window is like a beacon to curious neighbors or bandits.
Step Three: Cover walls, ceiling,
floor-every thing-with a highly reflective
material like flat white paint or Mylar. The
more reflection, the more light energy available to plants. Good reflective light will allow
effective coverage of an HID lamp to
increase from 10 to 20 percent, just by putting a few dollars worth of paint on the walls.
Reflective white VisqueenQI) plastic is inexpensive and protects walls and floors.
Step Four: See ''Setting Up the Vent Fan" in
Chapter Thirteen. Constant air circulation
and a supply of fresh air are essential but
often inadequate. There should be at least
one fresh-air vent in every grow room. Vents
can be an open door, window, or duct vented to the outside. An exhaust fan vented outdoors or pulling new air through an open
door usually creates an adequate flow of air.
An oscillating fan works well to circulate air.
When installing such a fan, make sure it is
not set in a fixed position and blowing too
hard on tender plants. It could cause windburn and dry out plants, especially seedlings
and clones. If the room contains a heat vent,
it may be opened to supply extra heat or air
circulation.

This attic grow room is insulated with
Styrofoam and reflection/anti-detection barrier
foil available at www.hYS!!Ilfl.[y.nf, which keeps
the heat signature from showing.

In this simple Sea of Green layout, there are
ten plants in each tray (80 total plants) illuminated by a single 1000-watt HID. Each week
one tray of ten plants is harvested, and ten
new plants are started.

These plants are growing in 3-gallon (II L)
pots and spaced on 6-inch (15 em) centers.
The 5-foot (2 m) high walls are covered with
white Visqueen plastic.

Keeping heat inside the room is as important
as keeping it out! Insulation will keep heat
out, and the heat generated inside the room
will be easy to control.

Step Five: The larger your garden becomes,
the more water it will need. A 10 x 1o-foot
(3 x 3 m) garden could use more than 50
gallons (190 L} per week. Carrying water is
hard, regular work. One gallon (3.8 L) of
water weighs eight pounds (3.6 kg); 50 x 8
= 400 pounds (1 80 kg) of water a week! It is
much easier to run in a hose with an on/off
valve or install a hose bib in the room than
to schlep water. A three-foot (90 em) watering wand attached to the hose on/off valve
makes watering easier and saves branches
from being broken when watering in dense
foliage. Hook up the hose to a hot and cold
water source so the temperature is easy to
regulate.
Step Six: Ideally, the floor should be concrete or a smooth surface that can be swept
and washed down. A floor drain is very
handy. In grow rooms with carpet or wood
floors, a large, white painter's drop cloth or
thick, white Visqueen plastic, will protect
floors from moisture. Trays placed beneath
each container add protection and conven•
1ence.
Step Seven: Mount a hook strong enough
to support 30 pounds (14kg) for each lamp.
Attach an adjustable chain or cord and pulley between the ceiling hook and the lamp
fixture. The adjustable connection makes it
easy to keep the lamp at the proper distance
from plants and up out of the way during
maintenance.
Step Eight: There are some tools an indoor
gardener must have and a few extra tools that
make indoor horticulture much more precise
and
cost effective. The extra tools help make
•
the garden so efficient that they pay for themselves in a few weeks. Procure all the tools
before bringing plants into the room. If the
tools are there when needed, chances are
they will be put to use. A hygrometer is a
good example. If plants show signs of slow,
sickly growth due to high humidity, most
growers will not identify the exact cause right
away. They will wait and guess, wait and

j

guess, and maybe figure it out before a fungus attacks and the plant dies. When a
hygrometer is installed before plants are
brought into the grow room, the horticulturist
will know from the start when the humidity is
too high and causing sickly growth.
Step Nine: Read and complete: "Setting Up
the HID Lamp" at the end of Chapter Two.
Step Ten: Move seedlings and rooted
clones into the room. Huddle them closely
together under the lamp. Make sure the HID
is not so close to small plants that it burns
their leaves. Position 400-watt lamps 18
inches (45 em) above seedlings and clones.
Place a 600-watt lamp 24 inches (60 em)
away and a 1000-watt lamp 30 inches (75
em) away. Check the distance daily. Hang a
precut string from the hood to measure distance.

Greenhouses and Cold
Frames
This simple overview of greenhouses and
cold frames will give you a feeling of what to
look for and how to plan your project and
reap a heavy harvest. Several links below will
help you tap into the wealth of information
on greenhouses and cold frames.
Greenhouses, cold fram es, and hot fram es
are all useful in extending the growing season and/or protecting new plants and
seedlings. Which type of structure you select
depends on the size and location of your
growing area, how much money you have to
spend, how much time you have to grow,
and security issues. Simple cold frames and
hot frames can be assembled from common
materials like old framed window panes and
hay bales. Greenhouses are generally larger
and more complex. They can be expensive to
build and maintain but offer more fl exibility
for growing time and building use.
When deciding on a growing structure, first
carefully analyze the project on paper.
Consider how much space you have for the

A vent fan and an oscillating circulation fan
are essential to maintain a healthy environment.

footprint and how many plants you can grow
safely. Cold frames are small and can be as
simple as a glass or plastic frame set on the
ground with no artificial heat source. Their
basic function is to protect young plants and
seedlings from wind and cold in the early
spring, but they can also be blacked out to
induce early flowering and harvest. Hot
frames are similar in size and structure but
provide heat through manure, electricity,
steam, or a hot-water pipe (radiant heat).
You may use a hot frame to raise early
seedlings and clones, after which the structure can be converted into a cold frame.
Both frames share the advantages of economy, simplicity, small size, and portability.
Both large and small greenhouses cost
more money, time, and space. With the
exception of the lightweight "hoop" house or
miniature greenhouse, they are also more
permanent. The type of greenhouse selected
will be determined by the planned use of the
space and where it will be located. A lean-to
or attached greenhouse will probably be
smaller and less expensive to build than a
freestanding structure.

Total area of the greenhouse is determined
by the number of plants you intend to grow.
Allow one square yard (90 cm 2) per mature
plant. Do not forget to allow about six inches (1 5 em) space for air circulation between
benches and side-walls. Add space for walkways-standing room only or room for a
wheelbarrow- and possibly a center bench.
Glass, plastic panels, and sheeting all come
in standard widths, and it is easier to build in
a size compatible with these units rather
than have to cut the panels down. For example, an eight-foot (2.4 m) house can be
made with two 48-inch ( 120 em) wide fiberglass panels. Center height depends on the
level of the eaves. Low growing plants can
tal<e an eave of five feet (1.5 m); tall plants
need six or seven feet (1.8 or 2.1 m). After
determining eave height, a simple formula
will give you the center height: Center height
= eave+ 0.25 width (a twelve-foot wide (3.6
m) house with a five-foot (1.5 m) eave will
have a center height of eight feet (2.4 m).
Budget, building skills, and security will
weigh heavily in the decision making
process. The least expensive structure per
square foot (m 2) is an even-span 16-foot
(4.8 m) wide that will house two side beds
or benches, two walks, and a wide center
bed or bench. An 8 to 12 foot (2.4 to 3.6 m)
wide lean-to with wide beds or benches and
a central walk is the least expensive option
overall. Whichever option you choose, building it yourself will be cheaper and more
secure than hiring a contractor. You can purchase much of the plumbing and electricity
installations in kits or pre-assembled to
avoid compromising security. Here is an
excellent web site for the do-it-yourselfer:

Greenhouses can be attached (lean-to, window-mount, even-span) or free-standing. A
lean-to uses an existing structure for one or
more sides and is limited to single or doublerow plant benches with a total width of seven
to twelve feet (2.1-3.6 m) and length up to

security, the advantages of the lean-to are its

Small greenhouses and cold frames also
work well on patios, balconies, and rooftops.
They protect plants from wind and prying

An even-span can be an attractive option.
Like the window-mount or lean-to, the evenspan is attached to the house and bears similar limitations of size, light, ventilation, and
temperature. Unlike the lean-to or windowmount, the even-span can be larger and can
open into the house-providing heat and
humidity-or even function as a conservatory,
an attractive place to relax. It is, however,
more expensive to heat and maintain. Such
greenhouses are most popular where security is a minimum concern.
The freestanding greenhouse offers the
most flexibility in size and location. It can be
built to take full advantage of the sun, but it
does not retain heat well and can be expensive to keep warm. Many frame types and
coverings are available in kits or raw materials. There are also a number of good web
sites such as

they can be picked up and moved, are usually considered temporary by municipalities

ken. Plastics and fiberglass can provide safe,
economical alternatives.
Plastic is much cheaper than glass (a sixth
to a tenth of the cost), can be heated as
effectively as glass, and is equal to glass in
producing quality plants and buds.
Polyethylene (PE) is low cost, lightweight,
provides ample light, and can withstand fall,
winter, and spring weather. It does not tolerate summer UV levels, however, and must
be replaced annually. Ultra-violet inhibited
PE lasts longer, but both types lose heat
more quickly than glass. During the day, this
can help keep plants cooler, but at night the
heat loss requires the use of an artificial heat
source. Poly Weave''·' is a plastic fabric made
of 8-mil polyethylene reinforced with nylon
mesh. It transmits up to 90% sunlight, can
be sewn or taped, and has a lifespan of up
to five years.
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is two to five
times more expensive than PE but can last
five years or longer. Polyvinylchloride is pliable, transparent or translucent, and comes
in four to six foot (1.2-1 .8 m) widths which
can be sealed together to provide a superwide piece. Ultraviolet inhibited corrugated
plastic panels provide another option. The
panels can be used in cold frames, propagation houses, and greenhouses to provide
excellent wind and snow protection and
optimal solar heat collection. UV inhibited
corrugated plastic also has insulating properties (2.5 R insulation/3.5 mm panels, 3.0
R/5.0 mm panels).
Corrugated fiberglass is lightweight, strong,
~nd comes in eight to twelve foot (2.4-3.6

than glass. Its lower weight is an advantage,

Even the best greenhouses will lose heat
and improve growing conditions. Handthrough radiation, conduction, convection
operated roof vents will require frequent
through glass, walls, and floor (or soil), and
also through vents, doors, and cracks. To
counteract external variables, the internal
structure of the greenhouse is, in some ways,
more complex than the selection of framing
and covering materials.
All greenhouses need ventilation and most
need fans. Look for an extraction fan with the
capacity to change the air once every minute.
Capacity refers to the amount of power
needed to circulate the air volume of your
structure.
Calculate the volume by multiplying the
square footage of your greenhouse by the
height. Multiply the volume by sixty air
changes per hour to get the cubic feet per
minute (dm) capacity of the greenhouse.
For example a greenhouse with the followmg:
8 x 12 x 7 feet (2.4 x 3.6 x 2.1 m) greenhouse requires a fan with a dm of 40,320
8 x 12 x 7 feet x 60 minutes = 40,320

checks, or you may install automatic vents
with an electric motor and thermostat that
will respond to conditions around the clock.
Venting is important with a cold frame, too.
The high-end models have wax-filled vents
that operate automatically, opening when
the heat rises in the frame and contracting as
the temperature cools. You can find the
paraffin-filled "Optivent" and many other
greenhouse supplies at www.chadey~green­
bouse.com.
Heating systems are important to keep
plants healthy during cold nights. Cannabis
grows well with night temperatures of 60650F ( 16- 18°C), but colder nights will require
an additional heat source for sustained
growth.
You can turn a cold frame into a hot frame
by insulating it with manure or heating it
with steam, hot water pipes, or electricity. To
make the most efficient use of electricity,
purchase soil-heating tape or cable, with a
thermostat that will automatically control the
temperature. Lay the cable on the soil at the
bottom of the bed or on a bed of sand or
vermiculite and cover with about two inches
(5 em) of sand. You will need to provide 1015 watts of electric heat for every square foot
(30 cm2) of growing area. Heat cables are

seedlings, clones, or flowering plants without the cost of heating the entire structure.
Small greenhouses can be heated relatively economically with an electric space heater,
or more effectively with thermostatically controlled forced air using ducts or plastic tubing
to distribute the heat. Larger units. may be
heated with forced air or by a coal or natural
hot-water or steam system. Steam can also
be used to sterilize growing beds and potting
soils. Then there is the low-tech method of
greenhouse warming: compost. A grower in
Portland, Oregon, stacks organic matter on
the sides of the greenhouse to a height of
about five feet (1.5 m) inside and out. As the
compost decomposes, it gives off heat keeping the structure warm at a very low cost.
Evaporative cooling eliminates excess heat
and adds humidity, reducing water needs.
Moist air circulates through the structure
while warm air is expelled through roof vents
or exhaust fans. Properly installed, a cooler
can reduce the interior temperature as much
as 30-40°F (1 5-23°C) in hot, dry climates,
less in wetter areas. As with fans, the size of
the cooler is determined by the size of the
greenhouse. A general guideline is to find a
cooler equal to the total cubic space of the
structure plus 50%. To provide both cooling
and humidifying effects, the cooler must be
installed on the outside of the greenhouse;
otherwise, it simply humidifies without dropping the temperature. Turner greenhouses
has a handy site (bnR.:Li!OOillW.turor;cgreenhouses.comLCoolingLcooL!ip.html) with
some quick tips on selecting a cooling syst~m for your greenhouse. Other great greenhouse sites include:

and
b.llr.:LLwww.cRiungle.comL
nuecool.htm for a detailed explanation of
cooling needs and resources.
Misting and watering are also important
components of greenhouse gardening.

Extended periods of growing and higher sustained temperatures make adequate water
essential. Again, there are methods to suit
every temperament from low-tech to automatic.
Most companies offer watering and misting
systems by component, which can be mixed
and matched to suit the grower's needs.
Automatic systems will have a timer that triggers the mist or water at preset intervals. You
may want a toggle switch that allows you to
rotate between manual and automatic
watering. For more information on specific
uses and types of watering systems, go to a
website such as www.cloudtogs.com which
covers a variety of topics pertaining to the
internal greenhouse environment.
A lower-tech method of mist and watering
control consists of a series of screens that tilt
downward with the weight of the water
shutting off the flow then raising to restart
the cycle as the screens dry. It is fully automated by the weight of the water or lack
thereof. Of course, there is also hand-watering which is very effective and requires no
mechanical intervention. Automatic systems,
both high and low-tech, are alternatives to
hand-watering that can be most helpful during a gardener's absence.
Heating and watering devices depend on
that other cost of greenhouse keeping: how
much time the grower has to spend tending
plants. You can keep equipment costs to a
minimum if you plan to spend a lot of time
in the greenhouse. For growers who are
away from the structure for long periods,
automatic systems are a good investment.
In addition to shelter, heat, water, and ventilation, plants need light. This section will
offer a brief treatment of lighting, since it is
covered in greater depth in Chapter Nine.
Fluorescent light offers higher efficiency with
low heat and is the most widely used.
Incandescent light- 60-500 watts- may be

light source selected, you may want to purchase a light meter ($30-50). It will be very
useful in setting the light level in your greenhouse for maximum efficiency.
Carbon Dioxide (C0 2) is another important
aspect of the greenhouse environment that

will be only touched upon in this section.
Closed greenhouses often have too little C0 2
during the day for plants to be able to use
light effectively. Enhancing the levels of CO,
will accelerate plant growth; methods for
doing so range from expensive C02 equipment with infrared sensors to block dry ice
kept in a pressure bottle until needed. More
detailed information on C0 2 can be found in
Chapter Thirteen, "Air."
Security is always a concern when growing
cannabis. There are several ways to camouflage the greenhouse such as growing other
plants with the cannabis. Paint the walls with
sun-blocking paint so light still enters but
prying eyes do not. Go to the discount store
and purchase artificial flowers. Put the artificial flowers on and around the cannabis
plants so it looks like they are growing from
the cannabis. Remember to pay attention to
other plants that could be blooming during

Much of the information that pertains specifically to outdoor cultivation is in this chapter.
Many of the subjects within this chapter are covered in great detail in other chapters of the
book. References to these chapters are made in
the appropriate places.
Outdoor growing is more popular than indoor
growing in countries with lax cannabis laws. The
reason is simple-sunshine is free; lights and
electricity cost money. More people grow outdoors than indoors for this simple reason.
Cannabis is a strong plant that can be grown
successfully almost anywhere. As long as you
pay attention to security, virtually any growing
area can be altered enough, often with little
effort, to grow a healthy crop.
Do your research before planting. Read garden
columns and talk to local growers about the
best time to plant and grow tomatoes or similar
vegetables, then plan accordingly. Also inquire
about common pests and insects. Collect publications on local growing conditions. These are
often available at nurseries or through your local
department or ministry of agriculture.
You can grow anywhere. For example, one of
the first guerilla crops I planted was on a freeway on-ramp in a city in the Northwest U.S. in
the 1970s. I planted seedlings in a clay soil in a
blackberry infested environment in late June. I
gave the plants a single application of time
release fertilizer. By late September there were
short little female plants with dense little buds
to smoke. The harvest weighed in at just under
a pound of fragrant but leafy little buds.
Everybody called it "homegrown."
. My first big guerilla crop was planted and harvested in the California foothills. I hiked up one
of the many canyons carrying a 3.5 hp engine
that weighed 30 pounds, (14 kg) plus the pump
(another 30 pounds) and the plumbing connections that made it attach to a 2-inch (5 em) inlet
and a I.S-ind1 (3.5 em) outlet. Sdllepping four,

and 200 feet (60 m) of hose was a challenge!
I made these trips carrying conspicuous supplies at four in the morning. The hard part was
carrying it all back down when I closed down
the grow show!
After many trips up the canyon, I harvested six
pounds of Colombian and Mexican bud. The
quality was fair, but I harvested early and had
the only fresh buds in town in mid-September.
In "the good old days," rural real estate for sale
in northern California often advertised the number of marijuana growing holes that had already
been amended.
Now Park Rangers carry guns and have the
authority to arrest "suspected" growers. Latin
mafias have also moved into the National
Forests installing illegal immigrants with guns to
grow and defend large patches of guerilla grass.
The War on Drugs has turned much of America
into an unsafe place to live and grow.
Australia, Canada, much of Europe, and many
other parts of the world are significantly different; growers can plant in their backyards, greenhouses, or in remote locations with little fear of
arrest.

Strains
Selecting the right strains for your climate is
just as important as finding the perfect location.
This section on strains is adapted from a thread
started by Leaf, a

grower with tons of experience. One of the Case
Studies is also adapted from posts by Leaf.
Much more information is also available on the

This is a quid<rundown on some popular outdoor strains. The strains are grouped in five different categories distinguished by their finishing
times. For more information on strains, hit the
"StrainGuide" on www.Qvergrow.com,
It is a good idea to grow several different
strains with different finishing times to spread
out the work and drying over the course of time.
If you grow a spring crop, you can harvest much
of the season.

great varieties that finish mid- to late-August.
The yield and potency are quite high, but the
fragrance is high, tool These strains are for
experienced growers. They need lots of
intense sunlight and must be watered from
below, not from above with rain. These varieties start to bud when the days are long and
the sunlight is intense. The buds fatten up
quickly on plants with a short, squat growth
habit. Rain followed by hot sunny days can
foster mold, which could decimate the crop in
a short time. l eaf has seen dried, cured buds

problems, he suggests harvesting when about
10 percent of the pistils have died back. Even
heavy dew can cause a moldy disaster! Leaf

2. 'Early Pearl', 'Early Queen', 'Early Riser', etc.,
'Manitoba Poison', and similar strains finish
from late-August to early-September at latitude 49° north. They are potent and yield a little better than the plants listed above. They
grow from six to nine feet (1 .8-2.7 m) tall and
are quite bushy. Most of these strains are
mold resistant and easy to grow-excellent
choices for novices or growers with little time
to look after their plants.
3. 'Mighty Mite', 'Durban Poison', 'Jack 1-lerer',
etc., finish mid- to late-September. The yield
and potency are very good, and the odor is
not too intense. All the plants grow a huge,
dominant main cola with several large terminal buds on main branches. They may need
trellising to avoid broken branches. Topping
appears to increase yield. These strains are
fairly low-maintenance, but the more love you
give, the more they return. These plants grow
well if left alone until mid-September and
have a good harvest as long as they do not dry
out or fall over. 'Mighty Mite' is another
favorite.

potency are very high! They do not smell a lot
while growing, but that changes when they
are cut! They grow seven- to ten-feet (2-3 m)
tall and yield heavily. They require some attention to get the best crop. 'Super Silver Haze'
and 'Pure Power Plant' can be a bitch to grow
because they often develop mold near harvest
when the weather is damp. However, a mild
to moderate frost tends to bring out some
nice (purple) colors. They all do well outdoors
but grow even better indoors.
5. 'Skunk #1 ', 'Northern Lights #5', 'Big Bud',
and pure or nearly pure sativas finish from
late-October to early-November. Sometimes
salivas do not finish if the weather cools too
much and snow comes. One year, on
November 15th, the first snowfall had to be
shaken off at harvest! About 50 percent of the
pistils had died back. 'Skunk 4~ 1' is extremely
smelly; the wind can literally carry the skunk
scent for a mile. All of the plants in this group
have a large to huge yield capable of producing several pounds each. 'Big Bud' yields an
enormous amount; the bottom branches
must be tied or staked to avoid breaking from
bud weight. Potency is superb in all plants in
this category except for 'Big Bud.'
All plants grow tall. 'Big Bud' and 'Skunk 41'1'
grow I 0-14 feet (3-4 m) tall. 'Northern Lights'
are often taller! A few salivas can grow to 20
feet (6 m)l
Fungus can become a problem with these
late-flowering plants. They withstand rain and
light frost well; many can take a few light snowfalls. After all, they grow like weeds!

across the globe, providing unique growing
environments and countless microclimates.
Look for specific information for your climate at
local nurseries and in regional gardening books
and magazines or through the department of
agriculture (County Extension Agents) in your
area. Here is a brief rundown on the qualities of
different climates.
Coastal climates like those found in the
Northwestern United States, British Columbia,
Canada, Northern Coastal Europe, and the
United Kingdom, etc., are cool and rainy. Annual
rainfall most often exceeds 40 inches (103 liters
per m3) and can be as high as 100 inches (253
per m3)! Winter blows in early in these areas
bringing a chilling rain and low light levels. The
more northern zones experience shorter days
.and wet cold weather earlier than the southern
zones. Growing outdoors here is challenging
because the temperature seldom drops below
freezing, which contributes to larger insect populations. Some of these cold coastal rainforests
are packed with lush but invasive foliage and
fungal growth brought on by the cold and
damp.

Start Clones or Seedlings Indoors
Get a jump on the season by starting clones
and seedlings under lights indoors. Move small
containerized plants into heated greenhouses
to start hardening-off. Transplant to a backyard
or secure guerilla patch once they have become
hardened-off and are more resistant to environmental stress.
Beat the cold; start seedlings and cuttings
indoors and move them into a heated greenhouse in March or April. A 400-watt HP sodium
lamp on a timer can augment the less-intense
natural light of early spring. Seedlings and
clones will need at least 14 hours of artificial
and natural light per day until plants are transplanted outdoors.
Alpine mountain climates are cold much of
the year. Freezing temperatures, mineral-heavy
acidic soil, and wind top the list of grower concerns.
Summer temperatures in the mountains can

low as 2000 feet (61 0 m) elevation.
Temperatures below so•F ( 10°C) virtually stop
growth, and temperatures below 40°F (s•c) can

You can help your plants deal wi th mountain
stress by backfilling planting holes with a mix of
peat moss, soil, polymer crystals, and slow-acting layers of organic fertilizer.
Cold wind causes moisture loss, and plants

Cool mountain environments, like those in

America, usually experience first frost in
September and last frost during May.
Spring and fall months are rainy with a dry
period in July and August. Cold rains in the fall
can cause mold. Planting early-maturing strains

Prepare Soil
Help reduce the stress by growing seedlings in
tall containers (three-inch square by six-inch
tall) {8 cm2 x 15 em) which will produce a
strong root system and a plant that has a better
chance of SUiviving in tough conditions. Adding
water-absorbing polymers in the plant mix is an
excellent defense against desiccation, too. The
crystals expand up to IS times when watered,
making moisture available to the roots for
longer periods of time. Slow-release crystals will
allow an extended period between watering.
This is very helpful if your patch is in a remote
location that you cannot visit often.
Mountain areas can have poor soil and will
need to be improved before planting for best
results. Dig holes at least 18 inches {46 em)
wide by 18 inches (46 em) deep for each plant.
Place a handful of blood meal (see warnings in
Chapter Eleven) on the bottom and three to
four inches (8-1 0 em) of soil on top of it before
transplanting the cuttings or seedlings, then
water heavily. A little effort preparing the planting holes will result in healthier plants and a
heavier harvest.
On an incline, planting holes must be terraced
into the hillside and be large enough to catch
runoff water. Dig extra gullies to channel runoff
to growing plants, and make a "dish" around the
plants to hold water.
Plants remain smaller in rocky terrain but often
go unseen because they are grown where no
one expects to see them.
Clay forms an excellent underground planting
container. After a good rain, dig large planting
holes. Fill holes with lots of good dirt and compost. Backfill in layers; for example, fill a threefoot (90 em) deep hole with an eight-inch (20
em) layer of steamed bone-meal (see warnings
in Chapter Eleven) and soil. The balance is made
up of a thin layer of topsoil mixed with a rich
compost-manure-straw mixture, rock phosphate,
and seaweed meal. Mound compost and soil
about a foot above ground level. It will settle during growing season. See "Organic Fertilizers" in
Chapter Eleven for more information.

dolomite lime-all will help soil hold water- then
top with a concave bowl of soil that will catch
rain and irrigation water.

Raised beds
Raised beds are wonderful for growing in the
backyard. Cultivation and weed control are easier, and soil quality is simpler to maintain.
Build a raised bed on top of clay soils. Planting
in a bed raised six to eight inches (15-20 em)
eliminates the necessity of trying to dig in clay
while providing the early warmth and good
drainage clay lacks. Plants can be put into the
ground two weeks to a month early and may
even produce an early spring crop.

is on top of a two- to three-foot (60-90 em) high
compost heap. By the time the roots penetrate
into the compost, it has cooled enough that the
roots are safe from burning. He places a
portable greenhouse over the plants. The compost keeps plants warm while the structure protects foliage. This works exceptionally well to
coax a spring harvest.
Another grower prepares a vegetable garden
by dumping three cubic yards (90 cm3) of finished compost and manure with a dose of
dolomite lime into a raised bed, then he rototills and plants. When the vegetables are growing well, he transplants hardened-off clones to
blend in alongside vegetables.

Mulch
Mulch attracts and retains soil moisture and
smothers weeds. Mulch is a layer of decomposing foliage, straw, grass clippings, weeds, etc.
and/or paper, rocks, plastic, etc. laid around
plants.
Native foliage is an excellent and convenient
mulch. My favorite mulch is dry grass clippings,
which are free. Fill your backpack with lightweight grass clippings before every trip to the
patch. Always pile the mulch as high as you can
(6·12+ inches (15-30+ em), because it biodegrades over time.
Biodegradable plastic breaks down into frayed
strips that flap in the wind after continued exposure to sunlight. Plan to use it one year only and
remove it before it shreds into unsightly pieces
of long plastic.
Rock or rock dust makes excellent mulch. Use
rock mulches where they are readily available.
.They become hot to touch on sunny days, but
they still protect the soil from evaporative moisture loss.
Newspaper or brown paper shopping bags
make excellent mulch. Slightly wet paper is easier to work with and less likely to blow around.
Inexpensive and readily available, newspaper
layers should be at least six pages thick (preferably a dozen or more), before adding a soil or
mulch covering to hold it in place.

If fertilizing with every watering, you may need
to dilute the food to half-strength or less until
you figure out the proper dosage.
Fertilize with a mild, soluble flowering solution
for germination and seedling growth. Change to
a high-nitrogen formula during the vegetative
stage and back to a "super-bloom" when the
long nights induce flowering.
Use granular concentrated fertilizers or organic fertilizers that are lightweight and not bulky to
transport and store.
Build organic soils using different natural substances. Always use the most readily available
form of the element. See Chapter Eleven, "Water
and Nutrients," for complete information on fertilizers.

Woven weed barriers or strips of scrap carpet
let water drain but will not let the weeds grow
through. Cover these barriers with rock or bark

Cover the entire garden bed with black plastic
and cut holes through which seedlings are
planted. A soaker hose can be laid underneath
the plastic to irrigate. Make sure to cut large
enough holes so that plant stems do not touch
the plastic. Black plastic gets very hot during the
day but actually warms the soil very little. When
a young, tender plant stem touches the hot,
black plastic, it will literally cook at the soil line.

Fertilizers
Plants can be fertilized enough to make them
respond and grow well within a temperature
range of 60-90°F (15·32°C), reasonable humidity, adequate sunshine, and moderate wind.
Be sparing with fertilizer the first month after
transplanting. Depending upon the fertilizer,
application could be as often as every watering
or as seldom as every week or two.

Water
Clean rainwater is the best for irrigation. To
make sure it is not too acidic (acid rain) and
harmful to plants, take the pH and parts per million (ppm) reading from collected rainwater
before using.
Sodium-heavy water builds up in the soil causing slow growth and shorter plants with smaller
leaves. At low levels, sodium appears to benefit
plants and may even make up for potassium
deficiency, but too much leads to "sodium
stress." Roots lose the ability to absorb water
and other nutrients and will dry out even with
heavy watering. It is very important to test your
water for sodium and other dissolved solids and
take appropriate action if the reading reaches
more than 50 ppm. Sodium is more of a problem when growing in containers than when
growing in well-drained soil.
See Chapter Eleven for more information on
sodium and water quality.
Local farmers or the Department of Agriculture
have information about water solids in your
area, and many areas have low-cost, state-certified labs that can test your water for you.
Often, if the sodium content is below 300

ppm, a good flushing every month will keep
sodium and other salts from building up to toxic
levels.
There are several easy, inexpensive options to
improve water quality.
Irrigate seedlings, clones, and mother plants
with rainwater (or 50 percent rainwater with tap
water) to dilute dissolved solids.
Flush container gardens with three quarts
(3 l) of water for each dry quart (liter) of soil.
Water once with tap water and always afterwards with tap water augmented with ammonium sulfate.
Clean tap water by filling barrels and setting 23 feet (60-90 em) off the ground. Add ammonium sulfa te to settle out the sodium, then siphon
water from the top of the barrel, refilling after
each watering to allow the chlorine to evaporate. Chlorine, like sodium, is beneficial in small
amounts. It is essential to the use of oxygen during photosynthesis and is necessary for root and
leaf cell division. But too much chlorine causes
leaf tips and margins to burn and leaves to turn
a bronze color.

counteract this problem. Too much magnesium
creates rapid uptake of trace elements but does
not usually cause a problem.
The fertilizer comes in liquid or wettable crystal form and can also be used in soil to alleviate
problems caused by bad water. Several commercial hydroponic fertilizer formulations for
"hard water" are available and work very well.
Check the garden daily, if possible, and water
when soil is dry one inch (3 em) below the surface. Irrigate containers until 10-20 percent of
the water comes through the drainage holes.
Irrigate plants in the ground until they are completely wet.
Many different types of receptacles and reservoirs can store irrigation water. Use the biggest
storage unit that you can manage; you will
always need water. One good option for storing
a lot of water is to dig a nice big hole and line it
with a pond liner. For all kinds of water storage
devices, see vyww,rea!&QQds,co.m.
Pumps
Pumps move water long distances and uphill.
Pumps can be operated by hand, batteries,
gasoline, gravity, and with pressure from moving water.
Gasoline-powered pumps are reliable and can
lift much water uphill quickly, but they are noisy.
You can purchase a pump already attached to
the motor or connect them yourself and mount
them on a board. Check your local Yellow Pages
for a good supplier.
Noise is a major factor in starting up a small

water. Finding a water source above the garden
is the key!
Lightweight hose will not disturb foliage. If you
can find it in black, it will be more difficult to
spot. Most garden hose is a bright green color!

Temperature
The best way to control temperature outdoors
is to plant in the right place. Normally hot temperatures are common during midday in full
sun. Cannabis virtually stops growing at 85°F
(29°C). If you are planting in a hot climate,
mal<e sure plants receive filtered sunlight during
the heat of the day. Also, plant them in natural
breezeways so a breeze will cool them during
the heat of the day.
You can create shade over your patch by
bending tree branches and tying them in place.
Cold temperatures can be avoided by planting
at the proper times- well after last frost. Harvest
before first frost!
See Chapter Thirteen, "Air," for more specific
information about temperature.
A shade house covered with "shade cloth"
(synthetic sun-blocking material) or lath house,
which is built from thin, narrow strips of wood,
are great places to protect plants. lath houses

ing on the placement of the laths. Shade cloth
is available in different meshes that filter out 10,
20, 30, etc., percent of the sunlight. Shade or
lath houses are also a great place to pass summer days!

Wind
Wind is one of the strongest forces outdoors.
Sustained wind will sud< moisture from plants.
Wind causes plants to draw moisture from the
roots and shed it through the leaves in a defensive mechanism to regulate internal temperature and chemistry. It creates a problem if the
water supply is limited.
For example, Southern Spain and other arid
regions are subject to strong desert winds that
transport abrasive sand and other particles. We
call it "kalmia" in Spain because the grit is mixed
with saline air from the Mediterranean. These
winds can destroy crops. If your climate is
plagued by such abrasive winds, protect plants
vyith windbreaks. Wash foliage with plenty of
water to remove the particles after windstorms.
Moderate sustained winds will dry out container- and field-grown crops within a few
hours. Container crops suffer the most. For
example, plants grown in five-gallon (20 l) containers on a terrace that receives full sun and
constant moderate winds uses about two gallons (7.5 L) of water daily! Indoors, the same
plant would use 75 percent less water!

patula species, will repel nematodes, also
known as eelworms, from the soil for two to
three years if they are planted in an infested
area and then tilled under. Just planting them in
an area doesn't accomplish anything.
Numerous tests indicate that they do not have
an effect on insects above the ground.

Frogs and Toads
Frogs and toads eat insects
and slugs. The frogs will need
a water source, while toads
are more terrestrial. Large
snakes in the garden will eat
gophers, squirrels, and mice as well as the
moles and shrews. Snakes can give you a good
scare if you come across one unexpectedly! The
snake will also w ant to eat your frog. Plan carefully before committing to any mini-predator
solution to pest infestation.

Birds
Although most birds are welcome guests in most gardens,
there are some that can make
quick work of tender seedlings
or new clones.
The most effective way to keep
birds from freshly planted seed and transplants
is to cover plants with plastic wire or plastic netting. When installing the netting, make sure it is
securely fastened around the perimeter of
plants so hungry birds do not get underneath.

Deer and Ell<
Deer and elk love newly
formed growth on cannabis
plants. In addition, they may
destroy crops by trampling
them. Elk are somewhat of a
problem, and deer are a problem!
A cage around plants is the best deterrent. But
remember, the wire may be easy to spot if it is
not discreet in color. Deer are repelled by the

smell of blood and human hair. Place handfuls
of dried blood meal in cloth sacks and dip in
water to activate the smell. Hang sacks from a
tree to discourage dogs and other predators
from eating them.
Handfuls of human hair can be placed in small
cloth sacks and hung from a fence or tree
branch as a deterrent. Do not use your own
hair; it could turn into evidence for police!
Scented soaps have repelled deer from some
gardens. But if deer are very hungry, the smell of
blood meal, human hair, scented soap, or anything else will not deter them.
Always urinate in several locations around the
perimeter of the garden so animals take your
presence seriously. Some growers save urine all
week and disperse it at regular visits to their
patch.
Deer easily bound over eight-foot (2.4 m)
fences. A good deer fence is eight feet (2.4 m)
tall with the top foot (30 em) sloping outward,
away from the garden at a 45 degree angle.
Electric fences and large dogs are also excellent
deterrents.

Gophers

are small burrowing
rodents that eat
plant roots and
foliage. These herbivores find fleshy

cannabis. Should a family of gophers move into
your area, get rid of them as soon as possible!
Females can bear up to five litters of lour to
eight offspring a year. A family of gophers can
Clean out a large garden in a matter of weeks.
The only sure way to get rid of gophers is by
trapping. There are several gopher traps available, including ones that capture them alive. It
will take some skill before you are regularly able
to catch gophers with traps. You must avoid getting human scent on any part of the traps. If
gophers sense the human odor, they will simply
push soil over the trap to spring it or render it

OUTDOORS

Chapter SEVEN
otherwise ineffective. Traps are put in gopher
runways and so don't need to be baited.
A fence of poultry wire or 0.5-inch (1.5 ern)
hardware cloth buried one foot (30 em) deep
and standing 3 feet (90 em) above the ground
will exclude gophers. Line planting holes with
chicken wire before filling with soil. Driving
metal sheets around the perimeter of planting
holes will also prevent gopher damage.

Mice and Voles
Mice and voles can chew
bark from around the base of
cannabis plants (girdling). If
this is a problem, keep mulch
a foot away from plants, and
install a wire mesh around the
trunks. Mice and voles make nests in large piles
of mulch, and they are attracted to stored water.
Cover all water sources to exclude them, but
keep in mind that they might chew through the
container if water is super scarce.
The best mouse deterrent is a cat that is serious about hunting. Mousetraps also work well
on smaller populations. Removing a large number of mice with traps can be tedious and
unpleasant.
DO NOT USE POISON! Scavenger animals will
eat the dead rodents and may become poisoned themselves.

Moles
Moles are minor pests. They
are primarily insectivores that
eat cutworms and other soil
grubs, but their tunnels may dislodge cannabis roots.
Repel moles with castor plants or gopher
(mole) plants (Euphorbia /athyris). Castor bean
leaves and castor oil, as well as applications of
tobacco and red pepper, will repel moles if put
into their main runs.
Blend two tablespoons (3 cl) of castor oil with
three tablespoons of dish soap concentrate and
ten tablespoons (18 cl) of water. Mix in a
blender. Use this as a concentrate at the rate of

two tablespoons per gallon (4 ml per liter) of
water. Apply as a soil drench directly over mole
holes.
Barrel traps, scissor traps, and guillotine traps
are effective and kill moles instantly.

Rabbits
Rabbits eat almost anything
green, and they multiply like rabbits! Repel rabbits with a light
dusting of rock phosphate on
young leaves or dried blood sprinkled around
the base of plants. Manure tea sprayed on
leaves and soil may keep them from dining on
your plants. Rabbits find plants dusted with hot
pepper or a spray of dilute fish emulsion and
bone meal repulsive. There also are a number
of commercial rabbit repellents, but be wary of
using these on consumables!
A dog will help keep rabbits in checl<, but the
only surefire way to keep rabbits out of the garden is to fence them out with one-inch (3 em)
poultry wire. The poultry wire should be buried
at least six inches (15 em) in the ground to prevent burrowing and rise two or three feet
(60-90 em) aboveground. Wrap trunks with a
wire mesh or aluminum foil to keep rabbits
from chewing bark in winter or early spring.

Rogue Pollen
Rogue pollen from commercial hemp farms
and wild or cultivated males can threaten sinsemilla cannabis grown outdoors or in greenhouses. Undesired pollen can drift from a few
feet to hundreds of miles to pollinate flowering
females and cause them to grow seeds.
Large clouds of pollen blow across the
Mediterranean Sea from the Riff Mountains in
Morocco dropping pollen on Spain and
Portugal. In fact, local weather reports always
include the cannabis pollen statistics. The
reports are directed at people with allergies but
are also used by marijuana growers.
Make inquiries into air quality including
cannabis pollen. Some growers develop "allergies" in order to get the most information from

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/Outdoor M EDICAL GROW ER'S BI BLE
ofricials. Researching wind direction relative to
your crop and closest hemp plants will help you
select sites less likely to be contaminated.
Wind-shadows (large divots in a hillside) protect plants from wind and anything it brings
along.
If rogue pollen is a problem, plant early crops
or late crops that flower before or after male
plants. Usually June and July are the worst
months for pollen, but it could also spill into
August.

You may be able to grow indoors until the
industrial hemp is done flowering and males
are no longer releasing pollen, or plant out of
the wind pattern. If pollen is severe, keep plants
in a greenhouse. Cover the intake opening with
a moist towel-humidity makes pollen unviable.
Put one edge of the towel in a bucket of water
to wick moisture. Wetting down the exterior of
the greenhouse will also help incapacitate any
wild pollen.

Bacl<yard Growing
Lucky growers who live in countries that tolerate cannabis can safely plant a crop in their
backyard and give their garden the tender loving
care it deserves. You can pay close attention to
your plants' soil, water, and nutrient needs.
Growing cannabis in your flower and vegetable
garden is ideal because you can care for all your
plants at the same time.

planting holes or garden beds. Turn it over and
make sure it has plenty of amendments (see
Chapter Ten). Always put a heavy layer of mulch
on any soil that will be planted! A 12-inch-plus
(30 em+) layer of mulch will keep soil elements
intact as well as attract moisture. Bare soil loses
most of its valuable topsoil to erosion during
winter months.
In the spring, mulched amended soil should
be well-mixed and ready for planting. You can
transplant cannabis seedlings or clones in the
garden just like you would tomatoes. If your soil
is poor, or you didn't begin cultivation in fall, dig
large holes, three feet (90 em) in diameter by
three feet (90 em) deep, and fill with your best
compost, potting soil, or planting mix.
Otherwise, break up the top six to eight inches

from being cooked by heat from the sun.

Terrace Growing
Growing in containers on a terrace, balcony, or
roof is very rewarding. A small sunny location,
good genetics, containers, and good soil are the
basic needs.
Your gardening techniques will depend upon
the location of the grow show. City building
rooftops, terraces, and balconies tend to be
windy. The higher the garden, the more wind.
Wind dries plants quickly. See "Wind" in this
chapter.
Patio gardens are most often protected from
strong winds and strong sunlight.
An automatic watering system is often a good
idea in such gardens to ensure they receive adequate water, especially if you are gone for a few
days.
Pots will also need to be shaded from sunlight. Hot sun beating down on pots cooks plant
roots. See Chapters Six ("Grow Rooms") and
Ten ("Soil") for more information.

Beautiful plants line this protected Spanish terrace.

Containers with wheels are much easier to
move, especially if you are moving them back
and forth from indoors to outdoors.
Even with adequate security, the standard
issues of water, soil, and fertilizer apply. For a
successful crop, daily maintenance is essential
during hot and windy weather.
Wind can carry rogue male pollen or industrial
hemp pollen creating problems for terrace
growers. Plan ahead. See "Rogue Pollen" above.

Guerilla Growing
Location
Guerilla growing, a term coined in the early
1970s, requires strategy, time, and most often,
physical prowess. Depending upon your location and local laws, clandestine guerilla growing
in remote locations could be your only option.
Location and security are the main concerns
for a guerilla grower. Choose a location that has
limited public access. Check regulations for
hunting and recreation, and think of who might
be using the area: hunters, mushroomers, other
marijuana growers, hikers, dirt-bikers, Boy
Scouts, etc. Select a remote site unlikely to be
used casually.
Look for a site that already has big green
stands of vegetation. Marijuana is a vigorous
plant with a large root system, and a flowering
female will stand out if surrounding vegetation
dies back before harvest. Stands of thorny blackberry bushes, ferns, and meadow grass are
good options.
Prepare your marijuana patch up to six
months before planting. Remove green vegetation in the fall for a spring garden. Clear a few
patches to allow sufficient sunshine, cut back
roots of competing plants, and till planting holes
two- to three-feet square (60·90 cm2). If possible, allow amended soil to sit for a month or
longer before planting. Remote locations are
hard to visit on a regular basis, so proper planning and preparation is important. If your home

detection. Rapid growth of native plants will
erase any obvious trail. You can fertilize to assist
in repairs, but be careful with application as wild
plants are easily over-fertilized. Remember, in
late summer and early fall, most native plants in
dry climates will not regrow.
Bring growing supplies to the patch and stockpile them over time- PVC pipe, gasoline-powered pumps, water tanks, soil, bricks of coconut
fiber, compost, etc.- and hide them discreetly.
You can take a few things to the patch each
time. Make these trips count; plan ahead.
Prevent the style, size, and sole pattern of your
shoes from leaving discernible tracks that could
lead thieves and cops to your patch. Your shoe
print could be used as evidence against you if
your patch is busted!
Camouflage plants by bending, pruning, or
splitting the stem down the middle. Bending
branches is the least traumatic and has more
subtle effects on hormones, liquid flow, and
physical shape. See "Pruning and Bending" in
Chapter Three. You can splitthe main stem (and
the plant) down the middle and stretch the
halves horizontally to create an espalier. Pruning
produces the strongest effect because it
removes the high concentrations of hormones
in the terminal buds and stimulates lateral
growth. Pruning several main stems may make
the plants less obvious but does not improve
harvest. Think carefully about desired outcome
before cutting.
Grow in sticker bushes or other unpleasant
foliage such as poison oak, poison ivy, stinging
nettles, etc, to discourage intruders. Look for
bushes that are dense and high enough to shelter the patch from view. This deters large ani•
mals or people from wandering into the site.
Protect yourself from these plants with a slick
rain suit and gloves. Wash after each visit to
remove irritating toxic oils and thorns.

Set up a pulley system to lift large containers
and potting soil up to the platform. Install an irrigation hose from the base of the tree up to the
planting area and arrange around the pots so
you can perform weekly watering with a battery
powered pump rather than climbing the tree.
Find a partner to stand lookout when you are
working in the canopy, and be sure to use safety lines. Do not overextend yourself. I used to
climb trees for a living, and my hard and fast
rule was to spend no more than four hours
climbing per day. When you get tired, accidents
happen. If you hurt yourself, you will not be able
to care for your plants!

Drought Growing
If you do not have access to a water source,
dry land crops are possible if the area gets at
least one good rain every one to four weeks.
In general, sativa strains have a bigger root
system than indica strains and are more
drought resistant.
Plants pull water and nutrients from the soil.
Acceptable soil will hold one inch (3 em) of
water per one square foot (30 cm2) of area and
grow a plant seven- to eight-feet (2.1 to 2.4 m)
tall with roots five feet (1.5 m) across and six
feet (1.8 m) deep. Insufficient water results in
small buds. A five-foot (1 .5 m) plant may produce only one to six ounces (30-180 gm) of
smokable bud. By contrast, a plant in good soil
with ample water will be more robust and yield
two to ten times more than those in poor soil,
making attention to soil and water quality
essential.
An easy, inexpensive way to feed and water
your plants is to cut a 3/16-inch (5 mm) hole in
the bottom of a five-gallon (19 L) bucket and fill
with water and water-soluble fertilizer. Place
one bucket by each plant with the hole oriented near the stem. Buckets should be refilled
every ten days during the hottest weather. You

Harden-off before moving outside into the garden or secret garden.
One grower I know keeps a stream of plants
moving from indoors to his outdoor gardens. He
plants the first crop of clones in three-gallon ( 11
L) pots in a greenhouse, hardens them off, and
moves them to their final location. The second
crop is moved into the greenhouse when the
first crop is moved out. He repeats this process
three to four times during the season.
A complete low-maintenance setup is the goal
for most guerilla growers. Loosen the soil,
amend it, and throw in a handful of polymers to
retain moisture. A thick layer of mulch, early in
the year, will attract water, keep the soil cool,
and prevent evaporation. Bury clones deep in
the ground to promote a deep root system that
will not require a lot of additional water.
Some growers transplant one-foot (30 em) tall
clones with smaller root systems by removing
the first few sets of leaves and burying the root
ball deeper with only six inches (1 5 em) of
foliage left above ground. Roots will grow along
the underground stem in a few weeks. Deep
roots will create more self-sufficient plants. This
is of particular importance in extremely remote
areas that are hard to get to and in the mountains where the rainfall may be sporadic.
· Pest prevention is crucial for guerilla crops,
because the patch is too difficult to maintain
every day or week. It is easier to keep pests from
attacking plants in the first place than to try and
do damage control later.
Water and fertilize as needed. See chapters in
this book that pertain to specific outdoor needs.

Harvest
Harvest before cold, damp, autumn weather
sets in. This weather causes fungus- botrytis
(bud mold) and powdery mildew. Many plants
can take a short mild freeze (30-32°F [-l -0°q).
But if the temperature stays below freezing for
more than a few hours, it could kill plants. Pay
close attention to weather forecasts and apply
the information to the microclimate where your
plants are growing. Be ready to harvest quickly
if weather dictates.
Law enforcement can force a harvest, too.
Limit potential discovery by hunters, hikers, and
cops by harvesting at night. Find out when
police or rangers are in the area, and plan to be
there at a different time. Police scanners that
pick up local police activities can come in handy
for determining their location.
Take a sharp pocket knife and a backpack to
haul your crop incognito. If you are harvesting
more than one variety, put them in separate
bags or wrap in newspaper before they go in
the backpack.
Determine a believable story to explain your
presence in the area, including proximity to the
garden, should you be discovered. Offer nothing, explain little, and keep it simple so you
don't slip. Always remember Bart Simpson's
words, "I didn't do it. Nobody saw me. You can't
prove a thing!"

lightweight and seemed very bright when the
lights were turned on.
Clones were potted and placed on the benches (ten under each lamp). For the first five or six
days, the lights were kept about one meter
above the plants, then gradually lowered to
about half that height as growth became
healthy and vigorous. Watering was done by
hand, and because .the soil was a premixed
organic blend, no extra fertilizer was added for
the first week.
Nigel and Terry hovered over this first crop like
proud fathers. They adhered to a daily schedule
of watering, monitoring pH, and inspecting
leaves for signs of insect attack and nutrient
imbalance. As a result, the plants developed
quickly and were ready to begin flowering by
the end of the second week. To induce flowering, the lights were set back from 18 to 12 hours
per day. About this time, they began to add
organic nutrient supplements to the daily soak.
As the plants developed further, they worked up
quite a thirst; all pots were watered until their
individual drip trays nearly overflowed.
The carbon filter was connected around week
6, in an effort to prevent odors escaping the
shed. This tactic worked well, but it reduced airflow. As the plants increased in size and density, it became increasingly difficult to keep grow
room temperatures below 86°F (30"C). On a
couple of occasions, the temperature rose
above 91 "F (33°C), and bud development definitely suffered. The guys remember one time
when every plant stopped growing for three or
four days after the room overheated.
As their crop approached maturity, Nigel and
Terry noticed something strange going on. Most
plants were finishing off nicely, but some (generally the biggest) didn't seem to be maturing
properly. The buds on the plants growing right
under the lamps were big but didn't seem as
solid or as resinous as those on the other pia nts.
This condition became more noticeable as time
progressed. By the 8-week mark, the larger
plants started to go a bit yellow and drop leaves.

It was time to pull the pin on this caboose!
The crop was harvested a few days later and
hung to dry. In general, the smaller plants produced better quality buds than the larger plants.
The yield was 8.4 pounds (3.8 kg) of very nice
weed, and wi th that in hand, who was going to
complain?
Actually, the boys were very happy with their
first result, as everything ran quite smoothly.
They had a few problems with heat, but they
learned a lot and gained the confidence (and
the $) to expand their room to its full potential,
33 feet x 10 feet (10 x 3m).

THE SECOND CROP:This was a time of change and serious
improvement. Over the past three months,
Nigel and Terry had visited the local hydro store
on many occasions and had struck up a friendship with one of the owners who worked there.
He had given them heaps of useful advice, and
the boys realized that without his input, the first
crop could have easily ended in failure.
The storeowner (we'll call him Bob) offered to
help the boys design their new double-sized
room, provided they purchase all their new
equipment from him, of course. He insisted that
the system they were currently running used
too much power, generated too much heat, and
was too labor-intensive to be successfully doubled in size and maintained by two guys already
working full-time jobs. As usual, Bob was talking
sense, so Nigel and Terry decided it was a safe
bet to play it Bob's way and part with the necessary cash. The total cost of Bob's proposed
improvements weighed in at USD $7552 (Eur
$6000). Calculating at a rate of Eur $2200/kilo,
'the first crop paid for itself and more than half
the expenses of the proposed expansion and
improvements. Cool!
Bob's plan was to: I) Double the length of the
existing two benches and line the walls of the
other half of the storage area with white laminated wood; 2) Set up an automatic watering
system wi th a large reservoir to reduce manual

labor; 3) Plant double the amount of clones per
area to reduce time in vegetation by a week; 4)
To achieve adequate air flow, install a new 5000
cu/ hr fan for air extmction, and use their existing 3200 cu/ hr fan for air intake; 5) Make use of
current advancements in reflector technology to
decrease the number of lights required- from
20 to 14- and consequently reduce the power
usage and heat generation by the same ratio; 6)
Bob also suggested ditching the pot idea in
favor of cocopeat slabs. "Just supply the plants
with a top-quality organic nutrient, and the garden will be state-of-the-art and organic."
The best way to explain the setup is to refer to
Plate C. The room was set up pretty much as
Bob had planned. Five Danish-made plastic 6
foot 6 inch x 3 foot 3 inch (2 x 1 m) trays were
loaded up with coco mats and placed on each
33 foot (10 m) long bench top. Each tray was
installed with a 3-degree tilt to promote
drainage. An elaborate system of drippers and
drainage pipes was constructed and each bench
was run as a separate entity with its own 400liter reservoir and 6000 L/hr pump. Both pumps
were timed to run x times a day for y minutes,
and nutrient runoff was pumped out of the
grow room and into the shower drain.
The fans were installed placing the 5000 cu/ hr
fan high at one end of the room and the 3200
cu/hr fan down low at the other. The 5000
removed air via the vent in the upper central part
of the room. The vent was box-shaped and permanently connected to the carbon filter. When
the filter was not required, a cover on the under
side of the box was removed, and air was drawn
out through the exposed opening. The 3200
forced cool air through ductwork that ran along
the floor under each bench. This air entered the
room in four places under each bench, equally
spaced along their length. Four pedestal fans
were used to mix the air and push it in the general direction of the outlet vent.
The room was lit using fourteen 600-watt
lamps, each covering an area of 4 feet 8 inches
x 3 feet 11 inches (1.43 x 1.2 m). This was

achieved by using high-tech adjustable doubleparabolic reflectors (Adjust-a-Wings). These flexible "wings" were highly reflective and could
spread light evenly and broadly at a range of
heights above the plants. They were rated to
cover areas of 4 feet 11 inches x 4 feet 1 inch
(1.5 x 1.25 m) and above with 600-watt lamps,
so 4 feet 8 inches x 3 feet 11 inches (1.43 x 1.2
m) was within prescribed limits. Another lighting
product was used in conjunction with the wings
and referred to as a Super Spreader. These fit
below the lamp and spread excess light and
heat from that hot area across the light's entire
footprint. They allow lamps to be close to plants
to produce rapid growth but keep growth rate
and plant size even.
When compared to the first, this crop almost
seemed to grow itself! The irrigation system
alone (reservoir size, how many days reserve,
nutrient dosing, the coco/Danish tray/ run to
waste system) saved Nigel and Terry about two
hours a day.
The ventilation design combined well with the
simple, effective lighting strategy. Air was
pumped in and pushed up from below, cooling
plants and lights on its way up. The heated air
would rise naturally, be trapped by the ceiling,
sucked towards the vent/filter, and exhausted
from the room. With a small amount of adjust·
ment, the air temperature could be maintained
at 80-82°F (27°C to 2a•q even when the plants
formed a dense mass across the whole room.
The wing reflectors could be adjusted to provide even lighting when they were close to the
plants (growth and flowering phases) and when
they were farther away (early vegetative and
final maturation phases). When reflectors were
hung low over the plants, the spreaders dealt
with any hot spots and insured even lighting.
Nigel and Terry's second crop grew vigorously
and evenly all the way through to maturity. They
had a small problem early on with spider mites.
Seems the clones they bought had a few mites
onboard. The mites were dealt with organically
and effectively. Bob had suggested the boys use

Ecolizer organic nutrients and follow their program exactly. The program suggested misting
clones regularly with their "Bugs Away" foliar
feed. This solution contains nutrition plus essential oils that coat mite eggs and suffocate them.
No chemicals and it worked!
After a total of nine weeks growing, the room
was filled with plants that formed a dense layer
of evenly developed, sticky, fat bud. The room
resembled a "sea of green" rather than a collection of plants of assorted size and shape. As
they harvested, Nigel and Terry joked about
mowing down a mass of sticky green corn cobs.
Cutting, hanging, drying, and particularly manicuring this much weed was one hell of a job
and took them a month to finish. The final yield
was 12.5 kilos and the quality was A+.
At this point, the boys had covered all their
expenses, they were almost half way into their
third crop (which was growing strong), and
were already 10 kilos in the black. This had
been an ambitious project. Nigel and Terry had

Calendar and Checklist
'

A calendar helps growers know what to do
and when to prepare to do it. A checklist adds
necessary routine to the process. The calendar
outlines the average three-month life cycle of
clones. It notes major points of interest during
each ~tage in life. The weekly checklist consists
of a few things that must be done every week
to ensure a successful crop.
Savvy growers read and consider each and
every point on the calendar weekly. They mark
each point with a check when finished with it.
Growers should spend at least 10 minutes per
day, per lamp, to have a productive garden. This
is enough time to complete all the stuff on the
weekly calendar. Much of gardening is simply
watching and paying attention, but it takes time
to have a decent, productive garden. If using
C02 enrichment or hydroponics, allow 20 minutes per day for maintenance.

Large chunks of time will be spent setting up
the grow room and harvesting. These are not
included in the 10-20 minute daily schedule.

Calendar
The calendar starts on January 1st and is only
three months long. Two weeks for clones to
stick (root), two weeks of vegetative growth,
and eight weeks of flowering. This indoor calendar can be started any day of the year, no matter which direction the wind is blowing or what
the weatherman says.
If the garden is full of clones grown with C0 2
enrichment or hydroponically, the calendar
could move up one week, depending on how
fast the garden grows. Remember, light intensity substantially diminishes over four feet away
from the bulb.

Weekly Checklist
Check the following to see if they
function properly:
Air ventilation
Air circulation
Humidity: 40-50 percent

Light, Spectrum, and
Photoperiod
Marijuana needs light to grow. The light must
have the proper spectrum and intensity to
ensure rapid growth. Light is comprised of separate bands of colors. Each color in the spectrum
sends the plant a separate signal. Each color in
the spectrum promotes a different type of
growth.

PAR and Light Spectrum
Plants need and use only certain portions of
the light spectrum. The most important colors in
the spectrum for maximum chlorophyll production and photosynthetic response are in the blue
and red range. The main portion of light used by
plants is between 400 and 700 nanometers
(nm)."'
This region
is called
the
Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)
zone.**
"PAR watts" is the measure of the actual
amount of specific photons a plant needs to
grow. Photons are a measure of light energy.
Light energy is radiated and assimilated in photons. Photosynthesis is necessary for plants to
grow and is activated by the assimilation of photons. Blue photons are worth more PAR watts
than red photons, but scientists have difficulty
measuring the exact difference.
Each color of light activates different plant
functions. Positive tropism, the plant's ability to
oril;!nt leaves toward· light, is controlled by specBulb Rating

trum. Light bulbs deliver only a part of the necessary light marijuana needs to grow. However,
they deliver enough! Most of marijuana's light
needs can be met by artificial means.
"One nanometer (nm) = one billionth (10-9 )
of a meter. Light is measured in wavelengths;
the wavelengths are measured in nanometers.
**Some scientists still disagree as to the exact
PAR zone and make their calculations based on
350 to 750 nanometers. PAR watts measured
with this scale will be a little higher.

dies, lux, or lumens. A foot-candle is a unit of
illumination equal to the intensity of one candle
at a distance of one foot. The lux scale is similar
to that of the foot-candle; one foot-candle is
equal to 10.76 lux.
Humans see light differently than plants do.
Compare the graphs above to see how the light
you see differs from the light a plant uses to
grow. Plants use the photosynthetically active
response (PAR) portion of the spectrum.
Humans use the central portion of the spectrum,
while plants are able to use large portions of the
spectrum not measured by light meters that
record foot-candles, lux, and lumens.
light is also measured in spectrum with Kelvin
temperature which expresses the exact color a
bulb emits. Bulbs with a Kelvin temperature
from 3000 to 6500 are best for growing marijuana. The PAR section above explains that plants
use specific portions of the spectrum- a complete range from blues to reds. Lamps with a
spectrum similar to PAR-rated bulbs can use
Kelvin temperature of a bulb to ascertain the
approximate PAR rating of the lamp. Color spectrum results from a specific mix of different colors. High intensity discharge bulbs are very similar in spectrum. Making these safe assumptions,
a rough PAR rating could be extrapolated from a
Kelvin temperature rating.
The Color Corrected Temperature (CCT) of a
bulb is the peak Kelvin temperature at which the
colors in a bulb are stable. We can classify bulbs
by their CCT rating which tells us the overall
color of the light emitted. It does not tell us the
concentration of the combination of colors emitted. Companies use a Color Rendering Index
(CRI). The higher the CRI, the better the bulb is
for growing.

M easuring Light
Virtually all light is measured in foot-candles,
lux, or lumens. Foot-candles and lux measure
light visible to the human eye. The human eye
sees much less of the light spectrum than plants
"see." The eye is most sensitive to light between
525-625 nanometers. The importance of the
blue and red portions in the spectrum is diminished greatly when light is measured in foot-can-

foot-candles and lux. This information is still
valuable, because it records the amount of light
spread over a specific surface. TI1e information is
then coupled with the PAR rating of different
bulbs. Regardless of the lamp, the amount of
light emitted is constant. It only makes sense to
use the proper reflective hood with a high PAR·
rated bulb to grow the best garden.
After all the talk about PAR watts, industry officials are unable to agree on a common scale of
measurement. For this reason, we have decided
to rely on Kelvin color temperature to measure
lamp spectrum.
•

Photoperiod
The photoperiod is the relationship between
the duration of the light period and dark period.
Most strains of marijuana will stay in the vegetative growth stage as long as an 18 to 24-hour
light and a 6 to 0-hour dark photoperiod are
maintained. However, there are exceptions.
Eighteen hours of light per day will give marijuana all the light it needs to sustain vegetative
growth.
Flowering is most efficiently induced with 12
hours of uninterrupted darkness in a 24-hour
photoperiod. When plants are at least two
months old-after they have developed sexual
characteristics-altering the photoperiod to an
even 12 hours, day and night, will induce visible
signs of flowering in one to three weeks. Older
plants tend to show signs of flowering sooner.
Varieties originating in the tropics generally
mature later. The 12-hour photoperiod represents the classic equinox and is the optimum
daylight-to-dark relationship for flowering in
cannabis.
Research has proven that less than 12 hours of
light will not induce flowering any faster and
reduces flower formation and yield. More than
12 hours of light often prolongs flowering. Some
growers have achieved higher yields by inducing
flowering via the 12-hour photoperiod, then
changing to 13-14 hours of light after two to four
weeks. However, flowering is often prolonged. 1

hour two to three weeks after flowering is
induced. They say the yield increases about 1o
percent. Flowering takes about a week longer,
and different varieties respond differently.
A relationship exists between photoperiod
response and genetics. We can make generalizations about this relationship, because little scientific evidence documents the extent to which
specific strains of cannabis are affected by photoperiod. For example, sativa-dominant plants
that originated in the tropics respond to long
days better than indica-dominant plants. On the
equator, days and nights are almost the same
length year-round. Plants tend to bloom when
they are chronologically ready, after completing
the vegetative growth stage. However, most
growers are familiar with the pure sativa strain,
'Haze: which flowers slowly for three months or
longer, even when given a 12-hour photoperiod.
You can start 'Haze' on a 12/ 12 day/night schedule, but it still must go through the seedling and
vegetative stages before spending three months

or longer flowering. Plants grow more slowly in
12-hour days than when given 18 hours of light,
and inducing flowering takes longer.
Indica-dominant varieties that originated in
northern latitudes tend to flower sooner and
respond more quickly to a 12-hour photoperiod.
Many indica varieties will flower under a 14/10 or
13/11 day/night photoperiod. Again, the hours of
light necessary to induce flowering in an indicadominant plant is contingent upon the genetics
in the strain. More hours of light during flowering
can cause some strains to produce bigger plants
with reduced flowering time, but some growers
have reported looser, leafier buds as a result.
Giving any cannabis variety less than 12 hours
of uninterrupted darkness will not make it
flower faster. Instead, the plant will take longer
to mature, its buds will be smaller, and the overall harvest will be lessened.
Genetically unstable strains could express hermaphroditic tendencies if the photoperiod
bounces up and down several times. If you plan
to give plants a photoperiod of 13/11 day/night,
stick to it. Do not decide you want to change the
photoperiod to 15/9. Such variation will stress
plants and could produce hermaphrodites.
Some growers experiment with gradually
decreasing daylight hours while increasing hours
of darkness. They do this to simulate the natural
photoperiod outdoors. This practice prolongs
flowering and does not increase yield.
The photoperiod signals plants to start flowering; it can also signal them to remain in (or
revert to) vegetative growth. Marijuana must
have 12 hours of uninterrupted, total darkness
to flower properly. Dim light during the dark
period in the pre-flowering and flowering stages
prevents marijuana from blooming. When the
12-hour dark period is interrupted by light,
,

Chapter NINE

LIGHT, LAMPS & ELECTRICITY

plants get confused. The light signals plants, "It's
daytime; start vegetative growth.'' Given this signal of light, plants start vegetative growth, and
flowering is retarded or stopped.
Marijuana will not stop flowering if the lights
are turned on for a few minutes once or twice
during the flowering cycle. If a light is turned on
for a few minutes- long enough to disrupt the
dark period- on two or three consecutive nights,
plants will start to revert to vegetative growth.
Less than one half of one foot-candle of light will
prevent cannabis from flowering. That is a little
more light than reflected by a full moon on a
clear night. Well-bred indica-dominant plants
will revert within three days. Sativa-dominant
plants tal< e four to five days to revert to vegetative growth. Once they start to re-vegetate, it
takes four to six additional weeks to induce
flowering!
When light shines on a green object, green pigment in the object absorbs all spectrum colors
but green, and the green light is reflected. This is
why we see the color green.
The smart way to visit a grow room during the
dark period is to illuminate it with a green light.
Marijuana does not respond to the green portion of the light spectrum, thus a green bulb is
usable in the grow room at night with no ill
effects.
Some growers leave the HID on 24 hours a
day. Marijuana can efficiently process 16 to 18
hours of light per day, after which it reaches a
point of diminishing returns, and the electricity is
wasted. (See Chapter Sixteen Breeding.)
I talked with Dutch and Canadian growers who

claim their plants flower under a 6-hour dark
and 12 hour light photoperiod. This expedited,
18-hour photoperiod regimen is supposed to
work, but I'm not sold on it. Growers say that
their harvest is undiminished, and that they are
getting 25 percent more marijuana in the same
time. I have not visited their grow rooms to verify these claims. No electricity is saved by adopting this regimen.

Intensity
High intensity discharge lamps are bright- very,
very bright. Growers who properly manage this
intense brightness harvest more weed per watt.

meager sum with a poorly designed reflective
hood, and beautiful buds suffer big time! The
closer marijuana is to a light source, the more
PAR watts it receives and the better it grows, as
long as it is not so close that heat from the lamp
burns foliage.

A 1000-watt standard metal halide emits from
80,000 to 110,000 initial lumens and 65,000 to
88,000 average (mean) lumens. One lumen is
equal to the amount of light emitted by one candle that falls on one square foot of surface one
foot away. Super halides emit 11 5,000 initial
lumens and 92,000 mean lumens. A I 000-watt
HP sodium emits 140,000 initial lumens, and a
600-watt HP sodium emits 90,000; watt for
watt, that's seven percent more lumens than the
1000-watt HPS. Lumens emitted are only part of
the equation. Lumens received by the plant are
much more important.
Lumens received are measured in watts-persquare-foot or in foot-candles (fc). One foot-candle equals the amount of light that falls on one
square foot of surface located one foot away
from one candle.
Watts-per-square-foot (or m2) is easy to calculate, but is an erroneous way to determine
usable light for a garden. It measures how many
watts are available from a light source in an area.

point source (bulb) and distance are defined by
the inverse square law. This law affirms that the
intensity of light changes in inverse proportion to
the square of the distance.
I = L/0 2
Intensity = light output/distance2
For example:
= light output/distance2
100,000 = 100,000/1
25,000 = 100,000/4
11 '1 11 = 100,000/9
6250 = 100,000/16

Light intensity is brightest directly under the bulb. To
promote even growth, arrange plants under lamps so
they receive the same intensity of light:

is often caused by the lamp being too far away
from plants. Dim light causes sparse foliage and
spindly branches that are further apart on the
stem.
Increase yield by giving growing area uniform
light distribution. Uneven light distribution causes strong branch tips to grow toward the intense
light. Foliage in dimly lit areas is shaded when
light distribution is uneven.
Reflective hoods ultimately dictate lamp placement- distance between lamps and above the
plants. Nearly all stationary lamps have bright
(hot) spots that plants grow toward.
Growers prefer high-wattage lamps- 400, 600,
1000, or 1100 watts-because they have lumensper-watt and their PAR rating is higher than
smaller bulbs. Plants receive more light when
the lamp is closer to the garden. Even though
400-watt lamps produce fewer lumens-per-watt
than a 1000-watt bulb, when properly set up,
they actually deliver more usable light to plants.
The 600-watt bulb has the highest lumen-perwatt conversion (150 LPW) and can be placed
closer to the canopy of the garden than 1000 or
1100-watt bulbs. When the 600-watt bulb is
closer to plants, they receive more light.
A 1000-watt HID emits a lot of light. It also
radiates a lot of heat. The bulb must be farther
away from the plants to avoid burning them. In
many cases it is more effective to use smaller
wattage bulbs. For example, two 400-watt bulbs
can be placed closer to plants than one 1000watt bulb, and the 400-watt bulbs emit light
from two points. The disadvantage is that two
400-watt systems cost more than one 1000watt system.
Check out the diagrams that show the differe'nce in usable light in different sized growing
areas. Growers who use these drawings finetune the area with a hand-held light meter.
Look at the simple mathematical examples
below to see how much more efficient 400 and
600-watt lamps are than 1000-watt lamps.
For example, a 1000-watt lamp that produces
I 00,000 lumens at the source produces the following:
The goal is to give plants 10,000 lumens.

Chapter NINE

LIGHT, LAMPS & ELECTRICITY

If you use three 600-watt HP sodium lamps,
you get a total of 270,000 lumens at a cost of
$0. 18 per hour (cost per kWh = $0.1 0). If you use
two 1000-watt HP sodium lamps, you get a total
of 280,000 lumens at a cost of $0.20 per hour.
Use the examples above to see the 1000-watt
HP sodium offers more watts per square foot
and m2 to achieve the desired lumen output of
10,000 lumens. However, the bulb also produces a hot spot near the center of the illuminated area. Plants tend to grow into the hot spot
and shade other plants.
Although 400-watt lamps have a lower lumenper-watt conversion, when used properly they
may be more efficient than higher wattage
bulbs. One 1000-watt halide produces 115,000
initial lumens and a 400-watt halide only
40,000. This means each 400-watt lamp must
be located closer to the canopy of the garden to
provide a similar amount of light. It also means
that several different point sources sustain more
even, intense light distribution.

Side Lighting
Side lighting is generally not as efficient as
lighting from above. Vertically oriented lamps
without reflectors are efficient, but require plants
to be oriented around the bulb. To promote
growth, light must penetrate the dense foliage
of a garden. The lamps are mounted where light
intensity is marginal- along the walls- to provide
sidelight.
Compact fluorescent lamps are not a good
choice for side lighting when using HID lamps.
(See Compact Fluorescent Lamps below for
more information.)

Some clones grow so fast that the harvl::!$1is ready
before plants shade one anorher.

Rotating Plants
Rotating the plants will help ensure even distribution of light. Rotate plants every day or two by
moving them one-quarter to one-half turn.
Rotating promotes even growth and fully-developed foliage.
Move plants around under the lamp so they
receive the most possible light. Move smaller

the hood before it is reflected downward to
plants. Reflected light is always less intense than
original light. Light travels farther before being
reflected in parabolic or cone reflective hoods.
Direct light is more intense and more efficient.
Parabolic dome reflectors offer the best value
for vertical reflectors. They reflect light relatively
evenly, though they throw less overall light than
hori zontal reflectors. Large parabolic dome
hoods distribute light evenly and refl ect enough
light to sustain vegetative growth. The light
spreads out under the hood and is reflected
downward to plants. Popular parabolic hoods
are inexpensive to manufacture and provide a
good light value for the money. Four-foot parabolic hoods are usually manufactured in nine
parts. The smaller size facilitates shipping and
handling. The customer assembles the hood
with small screws and nuts.
Four-foot cone hoods are usually manufactured in four parts. The smaller size facilitates
shipping and handling. The customer assembles
the pieces with small screws and nuts. Coneshaped reflectors using a vertical bulb waste
light and are very inefficient. Growers who try to
save money by purchasing cone-shaped reflectors pay even more in lost efficiency.
For example, say you bought a cone reflective
hood for S20 instead of the top of the line horizontal reflector for $40. First, let's look at efficiency. The cone hood produces at 60 percent efficiency and the horizontal reflector at 100 percent, or 40 percent more. Each lamp costs $36
per month to operate 12 hours daily at S0.10 per
kilowatt-hour {kWh). If 100 percent = $0.10 per
kilowatt-hour, then 60 percent efficiency =
$0.06, or a loss of ll0.04 for each kilowatt-hour.
With this information we can deduce that
$36/$0.04 = 900 hours. In 900 hours {75 12hour days) the horizontal reflector has recouped
the extra $20 cost. Not only does the vertical
cone yield 40 percent less light, it costs 40 percent more to operate! When this 75-day breakeven point is reached, you will be stuck with an
inefficient reflective hood that costs more for

fewer lumens every second the lamp is using
electricity!
Lightweight reflective hoods with open ends
dissipate heat quickly. Extra air flows directly
through the hood and around the bulb in openend fixtures to cool the bulb and the fixture.
Aluminum dissipates heat more quickly than
steel. Train a fan on reflective hoods to speed
heat loss.
Artificial light fades as it travels from its source
(the bulb). The closer you put the reflector to the
bulb, the more intense the light it refl ects.
Enclosed hoods with a glass shield covering
the bulb operate at higher temperatures. The
glass shield is a barrier between plants and the
hot bulb. Enclosed hoods must have enough
vents; otherwise, heat build-up in the fixture
causes bulbs to burn out prematurely. Many of
these enclosed fixtures have a special vent fan to
evacuate hot air.

Air-Cooled Lamp Fixtures
Several air-cooled lights are available. Some
use a reflective hood with a protective glass face
and two squirrel cage blowers to move air
through the sealed reflective hood cavity. The air
is forced to travel around corners, which requires
a higher velocity of airflow. Other air-cooled
reflectors have no airflow turns, so the air is
evacuated quickly and efficiently.

Water-Cooled Lamp Fixtures
Water-cooled and air-cooled lamp fixtures are
somewhat popular in hot climates. These lamps

Water-cooled bulbs are difficult for thermal

Keep outer jacket clean and avoid scratching.
Growers decrease .bulb heat by 80 percent
with a properly set up water-cooled bulb. The
water and outer jacket account for a ten percent
lumen loss. Growers make up for the loss by
moving bulbs closer to plants. On an average
day, a 1000-watt bulb uses about 100 gallons of
water to keep cool, if the water runs to waste. To
recirculate the water requires a big, big reservoir.
The water in the reservoir that serves a recirculating cooling system must also be cooled.
Reservoir coolers can easily cost $1000.
No Reflective Hood
One option is to remove the reflective hood.
With no hood, the lamp burns cooler and emits
only direct light.

Even though the lumens-per-watt conversion
is lower with 400-watt bulbs than 1000-watt
bulbs, hanging ten 400-watt lamps over the
same area that four I 000-watt lamps cover, provides more even distribution of light and minimizes shading. Three 600-watt lamps that produce 270,000 lumens from three point sources,
instead of two 1000-watt HP sodiums yielding
280,000 lumens from two points, lower total
light output by 10,000 lumens, but increases the
number of sources of light. Lamps can be placed
closer to plants, increasing efficiency even more.
Manually rotating plants helps them fill out
better, promoting more even development. The
longer plants are in the flowering growth stage,
the more light they need. During the first three
to four weeks of flowering, plants process a little
less light than the last three to four weeks. Plants
flowering during the last three to four weeks are
placed directly under the bulb where light is the
brightest. Plants that have just entered the flow-

ering room can stay on the perimeter until the
more mature plants are moved out. This simple
trick can easily increase harvests by five to ten
percent.
When plants get big, it can become laborious
to rotate them. Difficult jobs often go undone.
Save the strain and use a light mover, or put the
containers on wheels.
Add a shallow shelf around the perimeter of
the garden to use light that is eaten by the walls.
This sidelight is often very bright and very much
wasted. Use brackets to put up a four to six-inchwide shelf around the perimeter of the garden.
The shelf can be built on a slight angle and lined
with plastic to form a runoff canal. Pack small
plants in six-inch pots along the shelf. Rotate
them so they develop evenly. These plants can
either flower on the short shelf or when moved
under the light.
Installing rolling beds will remove all but one
walkway from the garden. Greenhouse growers
learned long ago to save space. We can use the
same information to increase usable grow space
in a grow room. Gardens with elevated growing
beds often waste light on walkways. To make
use of more growing area place two, two-inch (6

for more lumens from an additional lamp. It is a
more efficient way to use each HID, especially
1000-watt lamps. A lamp that is directly overhead casts more direct, intense light to a greater
number of piants.
Slower-moving light movers are generally
more reliable. Fast-moving light movers can
cause lightweight reflectors to wobble or list.
Light from a stationary bulb always shines with
the same intensity in the same spot. If upper
foliage shades lower leaves, growth slows and is
uneven. Light, received by plants from several
directions, shines more intensely on more
foliage. The light energy is being processed by
more foliage and promotes even growth. In
nature, as the sun arcs overhead, the entire plant
gets full benefit of the light. Most varieties of
cannabis grow into a classic Christmas tree
shape. This is the most efficient configuration for
the plant's growth. Light reaches the center of
the plant as well as all outside parts.
Commercial light movers supply more intense
light to more plants for less money. Growers
report that light movers make it possible to use
fewer lamps to get the same yield. Light movers
increase intense light coverage by 25 to 35 percent. According to some growers, three lamps
mounted on motorized light mover(s) will do
the job of lour lamps.
Motorized light movers keep an even garden
profile. The HID draws about 9.2 amperes (A). If
this lamp is on a IS or 20 ampere circuit, you
can easily add a light mover that draws one
more ampere to the circuit with no risk of overload.
Linear systems move in a straight line simulating the sun's path through the heavens. A linear
system increases intense light to plants in a linear oval. The area covered by a light mover
depends on the length of the track and the number of lamps. The systems use a track that affixes to the ceiling. The lamp moves back and forth
across the ceiling, guided by the track. The lamp
is fastened to the mover with an adjustable
chain or cord. These units vary in length and the
speed at which the lamp travels. Some are
designed for one lamp, while others are able to

Start using the light movers after the plants are
12 inches (30 em) tall and have several sets of

Planter boxes or containers on wheels offer a
good alternative to light movers. Containers are
rotated daily; wheels make this job a snap. Light
reaches every corner of the garden without having to move the lamp. This method has a similar
effect as moving the lamp overhead, but is more
work because all plants have to be moved,
rather than only one or two lamps.

bulbs have become slightly better at letting light

technical advances in these bulbs for the last 20
years.

band of chemicals used to dose the arc tube.
The arc tube is contained within a larger glass
bulb. Most of the ultraviolet (UV) rays produced
in the arc tube are filtered by the outer bulb.
Never look at the arc tube if the outer bulb
breaks. Turn off the lamp immediately. Some
bulbs have a phosphor coating inside the bulb.
This coating makes them produce a little different spectrum and fewer lumens.

(SunMaster) manufacture HID bulbs. These
companies construct many bulbs with the exact
same technical statistics. According to some gardeners, certain brands of bulbs are better than
others because of where they are manufactured.
They usually came to this conclusion because
they purchased two different brands of (1000watt) bulbs and had better luck using one brand.
What these gardeners don't know is that many
of the manufacturers buy and use the same
components, often manufactured by competitors!
Pulse-start metal halides commonly use 240
volts and harbor the starter in the ballast box,
not in the arc tube. These systems employ physically smaller reactor ballasts that keep original
line voltage within ten percent of the voltage in
the arc tube.
Reflective walls increase light in the growing
area. Less intense light on the perimeter of gardens is wasted unless it is reflected back onto
foliage. Up to 95 percent of this light can be
reflected back toward plants. For example, if 500
foot-candles of light is escaping from the edge of
the garden and it is reflected at the rate of 50
percent, then 250 foot-candles will be available
on the edge of the garden.
Reflective walls should be 12 inches (30 em)
or less from the plants for optimum reflection.
Ideally, take walls to the plants. The easiest way
to install mobile walls is to hang the lamp near
the corner of a room. Use the two corner walls
to reflect light. Move the two outside walls close
to plants to reflect light. Make the mobile walls
from lightweight plywood, Styrofoam, or white

Visqueen plastic.
Using white Visqueen plastic to "white out" a
room is quick and causes no damage to the
room. Visqueen plastic is inexpensive, removable, and reusable. It can be used to fabricate
walls and partition rooms. Waterproof Visqueen
also protects the walls and floor from water
damage. Lightweight Visqueen is easy to cut
with scissors or a knife and can be stapled,
nailed, or taped.
To make the white walls opaque, hang black
Visqueen on the outside. The dead air space
between the two layers of Visqueen also
increases insulation.
The only disadvantages of white Visqueen
plastic are that it is not as reflective as flat white
paint, it may get bri ttle after a few years of use
under an HID lamp, and it can be difficult to find
at retail outlets.
Using flat white paint is one of the simplest,
least expensive, most efficient ways to create
optimum reflection. Artists' titanium white paint
is more expensive, but more reflective. While
easy to clean, semi-gloss white is not quite as
reflective as flat white. Regardless of the type of
white used, a non-toxic, fungus-inhibiting agent
should be added when the paint is mixed. A gallon of good flat white paint costs less than $25.
One or two gallons should be enough to "white
out" the average grow room. But do not paint
the floor white- the reflection is detrimental to
tender leaf undersides. Use a primer coat to prevent bleed-through of dark colors or stains or if
walls are rough and unpainted. Install the vent
fans before painting. Fumes are unpleasant and
can cause health problems. Painting is laborintensive and messy, but it's worth the trouble.

About Ballasts
A ballast regulates specific starting requirements and line voltage for specific HID lamps.
Wattages from 150-1100 use old-fashioned coil
transformer-type ballasts. Smaller wattagesbelow 100- use energy-efficient electronic ballasts. Electronic ballasts run cool and quiet.
Scientists continue to develop electronic ballasts
191

MARIJUANA HORTICULTURE The Indoor/ Outdoor MEDICAL GROWER' S BIBLE
for larger wattage HID's, but the failure rate is
still very high. It is very important to buy the
proper ballast for your HID. Smart growers buy
the entire HID system- ballast, lamp, socket, connecting wiring, and timer- at the same time from
a reputable supplier to ensure the ballast and
lamp go together.
Be careful when purchasing ballasts that are
made in China or Asia, in general. Many of these
ballasts are poorly made and do not meet local
safety standards. Do not be tricked by misleading sales phrases such as ''all components UL or
CSA approved." Of course, each of the components could be UL or CSA approved, but when
the component'S are used together to operate a
lamp, they are not UL or CSA approved.
Furthermore, chances are that if components are
approved, they are not approved for the specific
application. Cheap transformers, capacitors, and
starters are cheap because they are of inferior
quality.
Do not try to mix and match ballasts and
lamps. Just because a lamp fits a socket attached
to a ballast, does not mean it will work properly
in it. If you use the wrong ballast, capacitor, or
starter with a lamp, the lamp will not produce
the rated amount of light, and it will burn out
sooner. The wrong lamp plugged into the wrong
ballast adds up to a burnout!

The "core," or transformer, consists of metal
plates stuck together by resin and wound with
copper wire. The capacitor can is on the right
under the connecting wires.
More economical ballast kits contain a transformer core, capacitor (H PS and some metal
halides), starter, containing box, and, sometimes, wire. You can purchase components separately from an electrical supply store, but it's a
bigger hassle than it's worth. If unfamiliar with
electrical component assembly and reading
wiring diagrams, purchase the assembled ballast
in a package containing the lamp and hood from
one of the many HID distributors.
Do not buy used parts from a junkyard or try to
use a ballast if unsure of its capacity. Just
because a bulb fits a socket attached to a ballast,
does not mean that it is the proper system. One
of the most miserable gardens I have ever seen
was grown with mercury vapor streetlights and
makeshift reflective hoods. The grower was low
on money, so he pilfered all the street lamps,
ballast and all, in front of his house.
Even though HID's have specific ballasting
requirements, the ballasts have a good deal in
common. The most common characteristics ballasts share are noise and heat. This noise could
drive some people to great fits of paranoia!
Ballasts operate at 90-l SO"F (32-60°C). Touch a

"strike anywhere" kitchen match to the side to
check if it is too hot. If the match lights, the ballast is too hot and should be taken into the shop
for assessment. A ballast that runs too hot is
noisy and could cause problems or burn out.
Heat is the number one ballast destroyer. Many
ballasts are manufactured with a protective
metal box. This outer shell safely contains the
core, capacitor (starter), and wiring. If you build
another box around a ballast to dampen noise,
make sure there is plenty of air circulation. If the
ballast runs too hot, it will be less efficient, burn
out prematurely, and maybe even start a fire!
More expensive ballasts are equipped with
ventilation fans to maintain cool operating temperatures. Air vents allow a ballast to run cooler.
The vents should protect the internal parts and
prevent water from splashing in.

Some industrial ballasts are sealed in fiberglass
or similar material to make them weatherproof.
These ballasts are not recommended. They were
designed for outdoor use where heat buildup is
not a problem. Indoors, the protection of the
sealed unit from weather is unnecessary and
creates excessive heat and inefficient operation.

small 400-watt halide ballast weighs about 30
pounds (14 kg), and a large 1000-watt HP sodium ballast tips the scales at about 55 pounds
(25 kg). This small, heavy box is very awkward to
move without a handle.
Most ballasts sold by HID stores are "single
tap'' and set up for 120-volt household current in
North America or 240-volts in Europe, Australia,
and New Zealand. North American ballasts run
at 60 cycles per minute, while European,
Australian, and New Zealand models run at 50
cycles per minute. A ballast from Europe,
Australia, or New Zealand will not work properly
at 60 cycles per minute. Some "multi-tap" or
"quad-tap" ballasts are ready for 120 or 240-volt
service. Single-tap ballasts accommodate only
one voltage, usually 120. Multi-tap ballasts
accommodate either 120 or 240-volt service.
It is generally easiest to use the regular 120volt systems, because their outlets are more
common. The 240-volt systems are normally
used in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand or in
North America when several lamps are already
taking up space on other 120-volt circuits.
Changing a "multi-tap" ballast from 120 volts to
240 volts is a simple matter of moving the wire
from the 120-volt tap to the 240-volt tap.
"Single-tap" ballasts cannot change operating
voltages. Consult the wiring diagram found on
each transformer for specific instructions. TI1ere
is no difference in the electricity consumed by
using either 120 or 240-volt systems. The 120volt system draws about 9.6 amperes, and an
HID on a 240-volt current draws about 4.3
amperes. Both use the same amount of electricity. Work out the details yourself using the chart
below.
'The ballast has a lot of electricity flowing
through it. Do not touch the ballast when operating. Do not place the ballast directly on a

Help control heat by placing it on or near the
floor to radiate heat in a cool portion of the grow
room, or move the ballast outside the garden to
cool the room. Attached ballasts are fixed to the
hood; they require more overhead space, are
very heavy, and tend to create more heat around
the lamp.
Ballasts may be manufactured with an
attached timer. These units are very convenient,
but the timer should be constructed of heavyduty heat-resistant materials. If it is lightweight
plastic, it could easily melt under the heat of the
ballast.
Ballasts with a switch allow growers to use the
same ballast with two different sets of lights. This
wonderful invention is perfect lor running two r
flowering grow rooms. The lights go on for 12
hours in one grow room while they are off in a

In general, I-IlD bulbs are designed to be tough
and durable. New bulbs are tougher than used
bulbs. Once the bulb has been used a few
hours, the arc tube blackens, and the internal
parts become somewhat brittle. After a bulb has
been used several hundred hours, a good bump
will substantially shorten its life and lessen its
luminescence.
Never remove a warm lamp. Heat expands the
metal mogul base within the socket. A hot bulb
is more difficult to remove, and it must be
forced. Special electrical grease is available to
lubricate sockets (Vaseline works too). Lightly
smear a dash of the lubricant around the mogul
socket base to facilitate bulb insertion and
extraction.
The outer arc tube contains practically all of the
ultraviolet light produced by HID's. If an HID
should happen to break when inserting or
removing, unplug the ballast immediately and
avoid contact with metal parts to prevent electrical shock.
Always keep the bulb clean. Wait for it to cool
before wiping it off with a clean cloth every two
to four weeks. Dirt will lower lumen output substantially. Bulbs get' covered with insect spray
and salty water vapor residues. This dirt dulls
lamp brilliance just as clouds dull natural sun1 light.
Hands off bulbs! Touching bulbs leaves them
with your hand's oily residue. The residue weakens the bulb when it is baked onto it. Most

growers clean bulbs with Windex or rubbing
alcohol and use a clean cloth to remove filth and
grime, but l-lortilux lighting advises cleaning
bulbs with a clean cloth only.
Lumen output diminishes over time. As the
bulb loses brilliance, it generates less heat and
can be moved closer to the garden. This is not
an excuse to use old bulbs; it is always better to
use newer bulbs. However, it is a way to get a
few more months out of an otherwise worthless
bulb.
Write down the day, month, and year you start
using a bulb so you can better calculate when to
replace it for best results. Replace metal halides
after 12 months of operation and HP sodium
bulbs after 18 months. Many growers replace
them sooner. Always keep a spare bulb in its
original box available to replace old bulbs. You
can go blind staring at a dim bulb trying to
decide when to replace it. Remember, your
pupils open and close to compensate for different light levels! One way to determine when to
replace a bulb is to examine the arc tube. When
the arc tube is very cloudy or very blackened, it
is most likely time to replace it.

Bulb Disposal
1. Place the bulb in a dry container, and then
place it in the trash.
2. lamps contain materials that are harmful to
the skin. Avoid contact, and use protective
clothing.
3. Do not place the bulb in a fire.

Metal Halide Systems
The metal halide I-IlD lamp is the most efficient
source of artificial white light available to growers today. It comes in 175, 250, 400, 1000, 1100,
and 1500-watt sizes. They may be either clear or
phosphor coated, and all require a special ballast. The smaller 175 or 250-watt halides are very
popular for closet grow rooms. The 400, 1000
and 1100-watt bulbs are very popular with most
indoor growers. The 1500-watt halide is avoided
due to its relatively short 2000 to 3000 hour life
and incredible heat output. American growers

generally prefer the larger 1000-watt lamps, and
Europeans almost exclusively favor 400-watt
metal halide lamps.
The main metal halide manufacturers include
General Electric (Multivapor), Osram/Sylvania
(Metalarc) and Westinghouse {Metal Halide),
Iwasaki (Eye), Venture (SunMaster), and Philips
J
(Son Agro ). Each manufacturer makes a super
halide which fits and operates in standard halide
ballasts and fixtures. Super metal halides produce about 15 percent more lumens than standard halides. Super halides cost a few dollars
more than standards but are well worth the
money.
SunMaster, a division of Venture Lighting, has
developed new horticultural metal halide bulbs.

Nigh Pressure Sodium Bulbs

Construction and Operation
Metal halide lamps produce light by passing or
arcing electricity through vaporized argon gas,
mercury, thorium iodide, sodium iodide, and
scandium iode within the quartz arc tube. After
they are in their proper concentrations in the arc
tube, the characteristic bright white light is emitted. This process takes about three to five minutes. The metal halide arc system is very complex
and requires a seasoning period of 100 hours
operation for all of its components to stabilize. If
a power surge occurs and the lamp goes out or is
turned off, it will take five to fifteen minutes for the
gases inside the arc tube to cool before restarting.
The outer bulb functions as a protective jacket
that contains the arc tube and starting mechanism, keeping them in a constant environment as
well as absorbing ultraviolet radiation. Protective
glasses that filter out ultraviolet rays are a good
idea if you spend much time in the grow room, or
if you are prone to staring at the HID!
When the lamp is started, incredible voltage is
necessary for the initial ionization process to take
place. Turning the lamp on and off more than
once a day causes unnecessary stress on the HID
system and will shorten its life. It is best to start

200

,.,.

the lamp only once a day, and always use a timer.
TI1e metal halides operate most efficiently in a
vertical ± IS-degree position (see diagram
above). When operated in positions other than ±
IS-degrees of vertical, lamp wattage, lumen output, and life decrease; the arc bends, creating
non-uniform heating of the arc tube wall, resulting in less efficient operation and shorter life.
There are special lamps made to operate in the
horizontal or any other position other than ± IS
degrees (see diagram above). These bulbs have
"HOR" stamped on the crown or base which
refers to horizontal.

Lumen Maintenance and Life
The average life of a halide is about 12,000
hours, almost two years of daily operation at 18
hours per day. Many will last even longer. The
lamp reaches the end of its life when it fails to
start or come up to full brilliance. This is usually
caused by deterioration of lamp electrodes over
time, loss of transmission of the arc tube from
blackening, or shifts in the chemical balance of
the metals in the arc tube. Do not wait until the
bulb is burned out before changing it. An old
bulb is inefficient and costly. Replace bulbs every
I 0-12 months or SOOO hours. Electrode deterioration is greatest during start-up. Bulbs are
cheap! Throw another one in, and you will be
happy!

The halide may produce a stroboscopic (flashing) effect. The light will appear bright, then dim,
bright, dim, etc. This flashing is the result of the
arc being extinguished 120 times every second.
Illumination usually remains constant, but it may
pulsate a little. This is normal and nothing to
worry about.

Metal Halide Ballasts
Read "About Ballasts." The ballast for a 1000watt halide will operate standard, clear, and
phosphor-coated and super, clear, and phosphor-coated halides on a 120 or 240-volt current Different ballasts are required for each
lamp wattage; 150, 250, 400, 1000, 1100, and
1500. The ballast for each wattage will operate
all halides (super or standard, clear or phosphor
coated) of the same wattage. Each ballast must
be specifically designed for the 150, 250, 400,
1000, 1100, or 1500-watt halides, because their
starting and operating requirements are unique.
Metal Halide Bulbs
Universal metal halide bulbs designed to operate in any position, vertical or horizontal, supply
up to ten percent less light and often have a
shorter life.
SunMaster Warm Deluxe Grow Lamps emit
balanced light similar to a 3000 Kelvin source.
The enhanced orange-red component promotes
flowering, stem elongation, and germination
while a rich blue content assures healthy vegetative growth.

High Pressure Sodium Systems
The most impressive fact about the 600-watt
high-pressure sodium lamp is that it produces
90,000 initial lumens. The HP sodium is also the
most efficient HID lamp available. It comes in
35, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 310, 400, 600,
and 1000 wattages. Nearly all of the HP sodium

bulbs used in grow rooms are clear. All HP sodium vapor lamps have their own unique ballast.
High pressure sodium lamps are manufactured
by: GE (Lucalox), Sylvania (Lumalux),
Westinghouse (Ceramalux), Philips (Son Agro),
Iwasaki (Eye), and Venture (High Pressure
Sodium). American growers use 1000 and GOOwatt HP sodiums most often, while European
growers love 400 and 600-watt HPS lamps.
High pressure sodium lamps emit an orangetinged glow that could be compared to the harvest sun. The color spectrum is highest in the
yellow, orange, and red end. For many years, scientists believed this spectrum promoted flower
production. However, with the new PAR technology, scientists are rethinking old theories.
Marijuana's light needs change when flowering;
it no longer needs to produce so many vegetative cells. Vegetative growth slows and eventually stops during blooming. All the plant's energy
and attention is focused on flower production so
it can complete its annual life cycle. Light from
the red end of the spectrum stimulates floral
hormones within the plant, promoting flower
production. According to some growers, flower
volume and weight increase when using HP
sodium lights. Other compelling evidence shows
the SunMaster halides to be superior. Growers
using a 10 x 10-foot (3 m2) room often retain
the 1000-watt halide and add a 1000-watt sodium during flowering. Flowering plants need
more light to produce tight, full buds. Adding an
HP sodium lamp not only doubles available
light, it increases the red end of the spectrum.
This 1:1 ratio (1 halide and 1 HP sodium) is a
popular combination for flowering.

Operation and Construction
High pressure sodium lamps produce light by
passing electricity through vaporized sodium
and mercury within an arc tube. The HP sodium
lamp is totally different from the metal halide in
its physical, electrical, and color spectrum 'characteristics.' An electronic starter works with the
magnetic component of the ballast to supply a
short, high-voltage pulse. This electrical pulse

Electricity passes, or arcs, between the two main
electrodes. If the lamp is turned off, or power
surge occurs and the lamp goes out, the gases in
the tube will usually need to cool three to fifteen
minutes before restarting is possible.
Similar to the metal halide, the HP sodium has
a two-bulb construction, with an outer protective bulb and inner arc tube. The outer bulb, or
jacket, protects the arc tube from damage and
contains a vacuum, reducing heat loss from the
arc tube. The sodium, mercury, and xenon gas

HP Sodium Bulbs

High pressure sodium bulbs are used for
industri al, residential, and horticultural lighting.
The bulbs are inexpensive and readily available.
Discount building stores often carry 250 and
400-watt lamps. All HP sodium lamps will grow
cannabis. Even though they are brighter, the
spectrum contains little blue and more
yellow/orange. Lack of color balance makes
plants stretch between internodes, but does not
necessarily diminish overall harvest.
Philips designed and manufactures the 430watt Son Agro specifically to augment natural
sunlight and grow plants. The bulb produces a

touch more blue light helps prevent most plants
from becoming leggy. The other enhanced performance HP sodium bulb is the Hortilux by Eye

Conversion bulbs operate at a lower wattage
and are not as bright as HP sodium bulbs.
Although conversion bulbs have less blue, they
are up to 25 percent brighter than metal halide
systems and their lumens-per-watt conversion is
better than that of super metal halides. The 940watt conversion bulb has a lumens-per-walt rating of 138. Similar to the HP sodium lamp, the
conversion bulb has a life expectancy of up to
24,000 hours. Unlike most high-pressure sodium lamps which flicker on and off near the end
of their lives, conversion bulbs go off and remain
off at the end of their lives.
Although conversion bulbs are not inexpensive, they are certainly less expensive than an
entire HP sodium system. For gardeners who
own a metal halide system, or who deem metal
halide the most appropriate investment for their
lighting needs, conversion bulbs offer a welcome alternative for bright light. In the United
States, CEW Lighting distributes Iwasaki lights.
Look for their Sunlux Super Ace and Sunlux Ultra
Ace lamps.
Venture, Iwasaki, and Sunlight Supply manufacture bulbs for conversion in the opposite
direction, from high-pressure sodium to metal
halide. Venture's White-Lux and Iwasaki's White
Ace are metal halide lamps which will operate in
an HP sodium system. The 250, 400, 1000-watt
conversion bulbs can be used in compatible
HPS systems with no alterations or additional
equipment. If you own a high-pressure sodium
system but need the added blue light which
metal halide bulbs produce, these conversion
bulbs will suit your needs.
Many gardeners have great success using conversion bulbs. If you have a metal halide system
but want the extra red and yellow light of an HP
sodium lamp to promote flowering, simply buy
a conversion bulb. Instead of investing in both a
metal halide and an HP sodium system, you can
rely on a metal halide system and use conversion bulbs when necessary, or vice versa.

and Retrolux (Philips) produce an HP sodium

bulbs make it possible to use a metal halide ballast and get the same spectrum as an HP sodium lamp. Lumens-per-watt efficiency is traded
for the convenience of using these bulbs. A
1000-watt HP sodium bulb produces 140,000
initial lumens. A MH to HPS conversion bulb
produces 130,000 initial lumens. If you only
want one lamp, a conversion bulb is a fair
choice.

The White Ace (Iwasaki) and White Lux
(Venture) are conversion bulbs. They have a

system. The bulb converts from HPS to MH and
produces 110,000 initial metal halide lumens.

Mercury Vapor Lamps
The mercury vapor lamp is the oldest and bestknown member of the HID family. The HID principle was first used with the mercury vapor lamp
around the turn of the 20th century, but it was
not until the mid 1930s that the mercury vapor
lamp was really employed commercially.
Mercury vapor lamps produce only 60 lumensper-watt. A comparison of the spectral energy
distribution of the mercury vapor and the photosynthetic response chart will show this is a poor
lamp for horticulture. It is expensive to operate
and produces a spectrum with a low PAR value.
Lamps are available in sizes from 40 to 1000·
watts. Bulbs have fair lumen maintenance and a
relatively long life. Most wattages last up to three
years at 18 hours of daily operation.
Bulbs usually require separate ballasts, however there are a few low wattage bulbs with selfcontained ballasts. Uninformed growers occasionally try to scrounge mercury vapor ballasts
from junk yards and use them in place of the
proper halide or HP sodium ballast. Trying to
modify these ballasts for use with other HID's
will cause problems.

Conversipn bulbs (T}ake it possible to have both metal
halide and HP sodium spectrums at the expense of
electrical efficiency.

Fluorescent Lamps
Fluorescent lamps have gone through major
changes in recent years. New bulbs produce
more light. Most growers use fluorescents to
grow clones and small vegetative plants and
maintain mother plants. Some growers even use
them to flower a crop. Fluorescents are available
in many different spectrums, some almost identical to natural sunlight.
Fluorescent lamps are long glass tubes that
come in a wide variety of lengths, from one to
twelve feet. The two- and four-foot tubes are the
easiest to handle and most readily available.
Two four-foot fluorescent bulbs in a shop light
fixture cost from $20 to $30.
Fluorescent lamps work very well for root cuttings. They supply cool, diffused light in the prop·
er color spectrum to promote root growth. Use
any "daylight spectrum" fluorescent lamp to root
cuttings. Fluorescents produce much less light
than HID's and must be very close (two to four
inches) to the plants for best results.
Using fluorescents along with HID's is awk205

ward and problematic. When using them in conjunction with HID's, fluorescents must be very
close to plants to provide enough intense light
to do any good. Fixtures may also shade plants
from HID light and generally get in the way.
Plants will flower under fluorescent lights. The
buds will be small and light, but, with enough
fluorescent light, you can grow a mature crop.
The grow show will have to literally be lined
with fluorescents.
Fluorescent tubes are available in so many different wattages or outputs that they are hard to
track! All fluorescents require specific ballasts.
The old standard (T12) tubes use about 10
watts per linear foot. A two-foot tube uses about
20 watts, four-foot: 40 watts, etc. The most common bulbs used for growing are available in
lengths from 15 inches (38 em) to fourfeet (120
em). Lamps are available in very low to more
than 50 watts. Circular fluorescent tubes are also
available but used by few growers.
Power twist, or groove type, lamps offer additional lumens in the same amount of linear
space. The deep wide grooves give more glass
surface area and more light output. Several
companies market variations of power twist fluorescents.
Black light fluorescent lamps emit ultraviolet
(UV) rays through a dark filter glass bulb, but
they are not used to grow cannabis. Ultraviolet
light is supposed to promote more resin formation on buds. However, all known experiments
that add artificial UV light in a controlled environment have proven that it does not make any
difference.
Most of the major lighting manufactu rers- GE,
Osram/Sylvania, and Philips- make fluorescent
lamps in a variety of spectrums. The most common are Warm White, White, Cool White, Full
Spectrum, and Daylight. See chart for Kelvin
temperatures. Sylvania has the Grolux and the
Wide Spectrum Grolux. The Standard Grolux is
the lamp to use for starting clones or seedlings.
It is designed for use as the only source of light,
having the full spectrum necessary for photosynthesis and chlorophyll production. The Wide

Mercury Vapor Spectrum

Full Spectrum?
The term full-spectrum was coined in the
1960s by photo-biologist Dr. John Ott to
describe electric light sources that simulate
the visible and UV spectrum of natural light.
Today there are many fluorescent lamps
advertised as "full-spectrum." All flu orescent
bulbs marketed as "full-spectrum" grow lights
are tri-phosphor-coated. Until photo-biologist
Dr John Ott began producing and selling the
first "color-corrected" bulbs, all fluorescent
lamps were halo-phosphor or deluxe halophosphor blends, which did not render the
reds well. Tri-phosphor-coated lamps emit
the visible light spectrum in spectrums from
2700 I< to 6400 K. They simulate colors by
mixing the three colors associated with the
three cone types in our eyes "specially formulated to replicate all the wavelengths in the
visible spectrum."
The term "full-spectrum" has been successful to help sell overpriced lights. Now the
market is rampant with hype about the lights.
Resellers purchase tri-phosphor bulbs from
manufacturers and market them as "Grow
Lites." Major lamp manufacturers do not sell
tri-phosphor-coated lights as "full-spectrum."
Spectrum Grolux is designed to supplement
natural light and covers the blue to far-red
regions. Westinghouse has the Agrolight that
produces a very similar spectrum to the sun.
Warm White and Cool White bulbs used together make excellent lamps to root clones.

Fluorescent bulbs are further classified by
diameter and come in the sizes T12 (1.5 inch [5
em]), TS (1 inch (3 em)), T5 (0.625 inch [1.5
em)) and CFL (see section below "Compact
Fluorescent Lamps"). The T12 uses old-fashioned magnetic ballasts. The T8 and the TS
(technically CFL's) use electronic ballasts.
Growers prefer slimmer TS and T5 bulbs with
electronic ballasts because they run cooler, electricity cycles faster, and lights do not flicker.
The average lumen output of a 40-watt Tl2 is
2800 lumens, about 68 lumens per watt.
A 32-watt T8 bulb yields 100 lumens per watt
and cranks out 100 average lumens.
A 54-watt TS throws 5000 average lumens,
which means it produces 92 lumens per watt.

Construction and Operation
Fluorescent lamps create light by passing electricity through gaseous vapor under low pressure.
Like the HID family, fluorescents require an
appropriate fixture containing a small ballast to
regulate electricity and household electrical current. The fixture is usually integrated into the
reflective hood. There are several types of fixtures. The most common fluorescent bulbs used
for growing are hooked to sockets with bi-pin
connectors. If purchasing new tubes, make sure
the bulb fits the fixture. The fixture may contain
one, two, or four tubes.
A ballast radiates almost all heat produced by
the system. The ballast is located far enough
away from fluorescent tubes that plants can
actually touch them without being burned.
Ballasts will normally last 10-12 years. Used
fluorescent fixtures are generally acceptable. The
end of a magnetic ballast's life is usually accom-

panied by smoke and a miserable chemical
odor. Electronic ballasts simply stop. When the
ballast burns out, remove it and buy a new one
to replace it. Be very careful if the ballast has
brown slime or sludge on or around it. This
sludge could contain carcinogenic PCB's. If the
ballast contains the sludge, dispose of it in an
approved location. Most modern fluorescents
are self-starting, but older fluorescents require a
special starter. This starter may be integrated
into the body of the fixture and hidden from
view, or be a small metal tube (about 1 inch [3
em] in diameter and 0.5-inch long [1 em)), located at the end of the fixture on the underside.
The latter starters are replaceable, while the former require a trip to the electrical store.
If your fluorescent fixture does not work, and
you are not well versed in fluorescent troubleshooting, take it to the nearest electric store
and ask for advice. Make sure they test each
component and tell you why it should be
replaced. It might be less expensive to buy
another fixture.
The tubular glass bulb is coated on the inside
with phosphor. The mix of phosphorescent
chemicals in the coating and the gases contained within determine the spectrum of colors
emitted by the lamp. Electricity arcs between the
two electrodes located at each end of the tube,
stimulating the phosphor to emit light energy.
The light emission is strongest near the center of
the tube and somewhat less at the ends. If rooting just a few cuttings, place them under the
center of the fixture for best results.
Once the fluorescent is turned on, it will take a
few seconds for the bulb to warm-up before an
arc can be struck through the tube. Fluorescents
blacken with age, losing intensity. Replace bulbs
when they reach 70 percent of their stated service life listed on the package or label. A flickering
light is about to burn out and should be
replaced. Life expectancy ranges from 9000
hours (15 months at 18 hours daily operation).

rescent lamps (CFL) are finally available in larger
wattages. The larger CFLs are having a major
impact on small indoor grow shows. CFLS are
similar to long-tube fluorescents but boast
increased power, smaller size, and an electronic
ballast that ensures longevity and precise spectrum rendition. Although not as bright as HID's
they are available in Cool White and Warm White
spectrums and generate little heat. Compact fluorescent lamps are perfect for growers with a
limited budget and a small space. They run cooler than HID's and require minimal ventilation.
When CFL's were first introduced, wattages
were too small, and bulbs did not emit enough
light to grow cannabis. New large-wattage CFL's
are much brighter than smaller, low-wattage
CFL's. Several years ago, European companies
started selling 55-watt CFL's and Home Depot
began to sell a 65-watt CF flood light for $30.
Soon afterward 95, 125, and 200-watt CF lamps
made in China became available in North
America and Europe. The new lamps changed
the way growers looked at CFL's. The new CFL's
provide enough light to grow cannabis from
seed to harvest
Compact fluorescent lamps used to grow
cannabis are available in two basic styles and
shapes. Modular CFLs have independent bulbs
and ballasts that can be replaced separately. The
bulb is shaped like a long "U" with a two- or
four-pin fixture (these lamps are designated
"1 U"). The 20-inch (50 em) long "lU" 55-watt,
dual-pin base bulbs are common in Europe.
Normally, two 55-watt lamps are placed in a
reflective hood. Shorter U-shaped bulbs are
common in North America, the United l<ingdom,
Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
· The second type consists of miniaturized fluorescent tubes packaged with an attached (electronic) ballast. The short lamps consist of several U-shaped tubes (designated 4U, 5U, 6U, etc.,
for the number of U-shaped tubes) that measure from eight to twelve inches (20-30 em) not
including the two- to four-inch (5·10 em)
attached ballast and threaded base. Smaller
wattages fit into household incandescent light

"photometric lumens." A look at their website

Furthermore, manufacturers commonly compare the output of
CF~s with incandescent lamps. But the comparison is misleading.
They claim the 65 watt CFL is equivalent to a 500 watt incandescent. A 65 watt CFL produces the same number of lumens as a
500 watt incandescent bulb. Given this information many people
assume that a 65 watt lamp produces as much light as all 500
watt bulbs. Not true.
Cool White CFL's have a kelvin (I<) temperature of 4100, with
more blue in the spectrum, which lessens internodal branching
space in plants. Cool White CFL's are perfect to grow short, stout
seedling and vegetative plants. Warm White CFL's (2700 I<) have
more red in the spectrum and can be used alone but are best
used in conjunction with Cool White lamps to avoid internodal
stretching during flowering. A 95- to 120-watt lamp will illuminate
a space of about two square feet.
Light from CFL's fades fast and must be placed close to the
plants. The bulb produces very little heat and can be mounted
about two inches (5 em) away from foliage to achieve the best
results.
Short U-shaped bulbs are most efficient when vertically oriented. When mounted horizontally under a reflective hood, much
light is reflected back and forth between the bulb's outer envelope
and the hood, which markedly lowers efficiency. Heat also builds
up from the ballast. Both conditions lessen efficiency.
Save electricity in the grow house and replace incandescent
bulbs with compact fluorescents. Compact fluorescents use about
75 percent less energy than incandescent lamps, and emit 90 percent less heat for the same amount of light. If you replace ten 100watt incandescent bulbs, you will save 750 watts of electricity!

Construction and Operation
Compact fluorescent lamps create light by passing electricity
through gaseous vapor under low pressure. Compact fluorescent
bulbs are coated inside with tri-phosphor which further expands
light emission. CF~s must warm up about five minutes so the
chemicals become stable before they come to full brightness. Lil<e
all fluorescents, CFL's require an appropriate fixture containing a
small electronic ballast to regulate electricity and household electrical current. Ballasts are either attached to the lamp (self-ballasted) or integrated into the reflective hood. Smaller self-ballasted
lamps screw into a household incandescent bulb socket. Larger
bulbs screw into a mogul socket. Each 1-U bulb is hooked to sockets with bi-pin connectors.
Compact fluorescent lamps will normally last 10-20,000 hours
(1 8-36 months at 18 hours daily use). The life of a CF ballast is
from 50,000 to 60,000 hours (seven to nine years at 18 hours

Incandescent Lamps

LP Sodium Lamps

Incandescent lamps were invented by Thomas
Edison. Light is produced by sending electricity
through the filament, a super fine wire insid~ t~e
bulb. The filament resists the flow of electnc1ty,
heating it to incandescence, causing it to glow
and emit light. The incandescent bulbs work on
ordinary home current and require no ballast.
They come in a wide range of wattages and con-

Low Pressure (LP) sodium lamps are monochromatic. Do not use these lamps to grow
cannabis. They produce light in a very narrow
portion of the spectrum, at 589 nan~mete~s,
and emit a yellow glow. They are ava1lable 111
wattages from 55 to 180. Their lumens-per-watt

market today. Their main use in industry has
been for security or warehouse light.
Lamps require specific ballasts and fixtures
according to wattage. The fixture for a 180-watt
lamp is just a little larger than a fixture for two
40-watt, four-foot {120 em) fluorescent tubes.
After visiting hundreds and hundreds of grow
rooms over the last 20 years, I have seen only
one LP sodium lamp in use.

About Electricity
You don't need to understand the basics of
electricity to grow indoors or in a greenhouse,
but understanding the basics will save you
money, time, and possibly the shock of your life.
Before you touch anything electrical, please
remember to work backwards when installing
electrical components or doing wiring. Start at
the bulb, and work towards the plug-in. Always
plug in the cord last!
Ampere (amp): is the measure of electricity in
motion. Electricity can be looked at in absolute
terms of measurement just as water can. A gallon is an absolute measure of a portion of water;
a coulomb is an absolute measure of a portion
of electricity. Water in motion is measured in gallons per second, and electricity in motion is
measured in coulombs per second. When an
electrical current flows at one coulomb per second, we say it has one ampere.

Breaker Switch: ON/OFF safely switch that
will turn the electricity OFF when the circuit is
overloaded. Look for breaker switches in the
breaker panel or breaker box.
Circuit: the circular path that electricity travels.
If this path is interrupted, the power will go off.
If this circuit is given a chance, it will travel a circular route through your body!
Conductor: something that is able to carry electricity easily. Copper, steel, water, and your body
are good electrical conductors.
Fuse: Electrical safety device consisting of a
fusible metal that melts and interrupts the circuit
when overloaded. Never replace fuses with pennies or aluminum foil! They will not melt and
interrupt the circuit when overloaded. This is an
easy way to start a fire.
Ground: means to connect electricity to the
ground or earth for safety. If a circuit is properly
grounded and the electricity travels somewhere
it is not supposed to, it will go via the ground
wire into the ground (earth) and be rendered
harmless. Electricity will travel the path of least
resistance. This path must be along the ground
.
w1re.
The ground is formed by a wire (usually green,
brown, or bare copper) that runs parallel to the
circuit and is attached to a metal ground stake.
Metal water and sewer pipes also serve as excellent conductors for the ground. Water pipes conduct electricity well and are all in good contact
with the ground. The entire system, pipes, copper wire, and metal ground stake conduct any
misplaced electricity safely into the ground.
The ground wire is the third wire with the big
round prong. The ground runs through the ballast all the way to the hood. High intensity discharge systems must have a ground that runs a

ground.
GFI: Ground Fault Interrupt outlets are
required anywhere water is used in a home or
business. Install GFI outlets in grow rooms to
provide an instant, safe electrical shut-off when
necessary.
Hertz: Irregular fluctuations or cycles in electricity within a conductor (wire). In the United
States, electricity runs at 60 hertz (Hz), or cycles,
per second.
Ohm's Power Law: A law that expresses the
strength of an electric current: volts x amperes =
watts.
Short Circuit: A short or unintentional circuit
formed when conductors (wires) cross. A short
circuit will normally blow fuses and turn off
breaker switches.
Volts: Electricity is under pressure or electrical
potential. This pressure is measured in volts.
Most home wiring is under the pressure of
approximately 120 or 240 volts.
Watts: are a measure of work. Watts measure
the amount of electricity flowing in a wire. When
amperes, (units of electricity per second) are
multiplied by volts (pressure), we get watts.
1000 watts = 1 kilowatt.
A halide lamp that draws about 9.2 amperes x
120 volts = 1104 watts. Remember Ohm's

Power Law: amps x watts = volts. This is strange;
the answer was supposed to be 1000 watts.
What is wrong? The electricity flows through the
ballast, which uses energy to run. The energy
drawn by the ballast must amount to 104 watts.
Watt-hours: measure the amount of watts that
are used during an hour. One watt-hour is equal
to one watt used for one hour. A kilowatt-hour
(kWh) is 1000 watt-hours. A 1000-watt HID will
use roughly one kilowatt per hour, and the ballast will use about 100 watts. Electrical bills are
charged out in kWh.
Electrical wire comes in many thicknesses
(gauges) indicated by number. Higher numbers
indicate smaller wire and lower numbers indi·
cate larger wire. Most household circuits are
connected with 14-gauge wire. Wire thickness is
important for two reasons- ampacity and voltage
drop. Ampacity is the amount of amperes a wire
is able to carry safely. Electricity flowing through
wire creates heat. The more amps flowing, the
more heat created. Heat is wasted power. Avoid
wasting power by using the proper thickness of
well-insulated wire (14-gauge for 120-volt applications and 18-gauge for 240-volts) with a
grounded wire connection.
Using too small of a wire forces too much
power (amperes) through the wire, which causes voltage drop. Voltage (pressure) is lost in the
wire. For example: by forcing an 18-gauge wire
to carry 9.2 amperes at 120 volts, it would not
only heat up, maybe even blowing fuses, but the
voltage at the outlet would be 120 volts, while
the voltage ten feet away could be as low as
108. This is a loss of 12 volts that you are paying
for. The ballast and lamp run less efficiently wi th
fewer volts. The further the electricity travels, the
more heat that is generated and the more voltage drops.
A lamp designed to work at 120 volts that only
receives 108 volts (90 percent of the power it
was intended to operate at), would produce
only 70 percent of the normal light. Use at least
14-gauge wire for any extension cords, and if the
cord is to carry power over 60 feet, use 12-gauge
.

When wiring a plug-in or socket:
The hot wire attaches to the brass or gold
screw.
The common wire attaches to the aluminum
or silver screw.
The ground wire always attaches to the ground
prong.
Take special care to keep the wires from crossing and forming a short circuit.
Plugs and outlets must have a solid connec-

tion. If they are jostled around and the electricity is allowed to jump, electricity is lost in the
form of heat; the prongs will burn, and a fire
could result. Periodically check plugs and outlets
to ensure they have a solid connection.
If installing a new circuit or breaker box, hire an
electrician or purchase Wiring Simplified by li. P.

It is not a crime to use electricity that has been
legally purchased. No sensible judge would
issue a search warrant on the basis of suspicious
electricity consumption. However, not all judges
are sensible, and small communities with bored
police officers or special marijuana task forces
often take it upon themselves to investigate
whatever information they are able to weasel
out of electric company employees. Larger
police forces do not have the desire, time, or
money to look for small-time marijuana growers. I once went to check on the electricity consumption of a home I was thinking about renting; I went to the electric company and asked
how much electricity the current tenant was
using. The electric company employee called up
the address on the computer and spun the
screen around for me to examine. I could see
the electrical consumption for the past few years
as well as all the personal information about the
tenant! If this is what I can do with a simple
question and a smile, imagine what law
enforcement officials can do with intimidation!
There are many ways to deal with the increase
in consumption of electricity. One friend moved
into a home that had all electric heat and a fireplace. He installed three HID lamps in the basement that also generated heat. The excess heat
was dispersed via a vent fan attached to a thermostat/humidistat. He turned off the electric
heat, bought a fireplace insert, and started heating
with wood. Even running three lamps, con•
suming three kilowatts per hour, the electric bill
was less than it had been with electric heat!
Electric bills are controlled with and generated
by a computer system. Monthly energy consumption is often displayed on a bar graph for
the previous 12 months. This graph makes it
easy to see fluctuations in electricity consumption.

This genemtor produces 4000 watts at full capacity.

Change the daylight cycle to be on at night, so
the meter reader sees the meter when the
lamps are off. Growers tend to know exactly
when the meter reader is coming around. Now
meter readers are using high-tech telescopes to
read the dials on the meter and storing the readings in an integrated digital entry device. The
information is then dumped into the larger computer at the central office. One friend had his

-

meter replaced by the power company. The company had noticed a major change in electricity consumption at the residence and thought that it
could be due to a defective meter, so the meter
was changed, but no difference was realized. Large
electricity consumers may use a heavy-duly commercial power meter.
Some people bypass the meter or figure out
some other way to steal electricity. This is a bad
idea. If you are stealing electricity from a power
company, they might find out. Stealing electricity is
a very good way to call unnecessary attention to
your growing operation. If you steal electricity, you
are making it easy for someone from the power
company to investigate you. Of course, some people have stolen electricity for years and gotten
away with it, and they might get away with it forever. Ironically, one of the main reasons that people steal electricity in the first place is because of
security. If conspicuous electricity consumption is a
problem, a generator will help.

Generators

Generators can supply all the electricity necessary
for a grow room, and you can grow "off the power

most often, used because they are reasonably priced,
dependable, and quiet But, they are not designed to
work for long periods. One grower I met hooked up a
generator to a six-cylinder gasoline motor. It could run five
lamps with ease, but it guzzled a lot of gas. Diesel motors
are more economical to run, but noisy, and the toxic
fumes reek. Always make sure gasoline or diesel-powered generators are vented properly. The exhaust produces carbon monoxide, which is toxic to plants and
humans.
Gasoline generator motors can be converted to propane,
which burns much cleaner, and the exhaust may be used
as a source of C0 2.
Diesel generators for truck and train car refrigerators are
fairly easy to acquire and last for years. Once set up, one of
these "Big Bertha" generators can run many, many lights.
Check with wholesale railway and truck wrecking yard outlets for such generators. The generators are usually moved
to a belowground location and covered with a building.
With a good exhaust system and baffling around the motor,
the sound is soon dissipated. Muffling the exhaust and
expelling the fumes is a little complex but very effective. The
exhaust must be able to escape freely into the atmosphere.
Maintaining a generator that runs 12 hours a day is a lot
of work. The generator will need fuel and must be monitored regularly. If the generator shuts down prematurely,
plants stop growing.
I once interviewed a grower who ran a generator for six
years. He seemed to know a lot about the idiosyncrasies of
the machine. He also had the innate feeling that the
machine would do something outrageous if he were not
there to make it right This underlying theme dominated
the entire interview. Running the generator motor-making
sure it had oil, fuel, and ran quietly- was all he thought
about when he was growing in the country with "Big
Bertha," who produced 20 kilovolts of electricity. Check this

Timers
A timer is an inexpensive investment that turns lights and
other appliances on and off at regular intervals. Using a
timer ensures that your garden will receive a controlled light
period of the same duration every day.
Purchase a heavy-duty grounded timer with an adequate
amperage and tungsten rating to meet your needs. Some

Chapter NINE
timers have a different amperage rating for the
switch; it is often lower than that of the timer.
Timers that control more than one lamp are more
expensive, because they require the entire force of
electricity to pass through them. Many pre-wired
timers are available at stores that sell HID lights.
How many lights (total watts) will the timer
handle? If you are running more than 2000 or
3000 watts, you may want to attach the lamps to
a relay, and control the relay with a timer. The
advantage of a relay is it offers a path for more
electricity without having to change the timer.
There are numerous sophisticated timers on the
market that will solve every last need you have.

Setting up the HID System Step-by-Step
Step One: Before setting up the HID system,
read "Setting Up the Grow Room" in Chapter Six,
and complete the step-by-step instructions.
Step Two: Both the lamp and ballast radiate
quite a bit of heat. Take care when positioning
them, so they are not so close to plants or flammable walls and ceiling that they become hazardous. If the room has limited space with a low
ceiling, place a protective, non-flammable material like metal between the lamp and ceiling to protect from heat. An exhaust fan will be necessary
to keep things cool. It is most effective to place
the remote ballast near the floor to keep things
cool. Place it outside the grow room if the room
is too hot. When hanging the lamp on the overhead chain or pulley system, make sure electrical
cords are unencumbered and not too close to any
heat source.
Step Three: Buy and use a good timer to keep
the photoperiod consistent. A decent timer costs
from $20 to $30 and is worth its weight in buds!
Step Four: To plug in the HID lamp, it will be
necessary to find the proper outlet. A 1000-watt
HID lamp will use about 9.5 amperes (amps) of
electricity on a regular 120-volt house current.
A typical home has a fuse box or a breaker box.
Each fuse or breaker switch controls an electrical
circuit in the home. The fuse or breaker switch will

LIGHT, LAMPS & ELECTRICITY
be rated for 15, 20, 25, 30, or 40-amp service.
Circuits are considered overloaded when more
than 80 percent of the amps are being used.
(See: "Overload Chart" on page 212). The fuse
will have its amp rating printed on its face, and
the breaker switch will have its amp rating printed on the switch or on the breaker box. To find
out which outlets are controlled by a fuse or
breaker switch, remove the fuse or turn the breaker switch off. Test each and every outlet in the
home to see which ones do not work. All the outlets that do not work are on the same circuit. All
outlets that work are on another circuit. When you
have found a circuit that has few or no lights,
radios, TVs, stereos, etc., plugged into it, look at
the circuits' amp rating. If it is rated for 15 amps,
you can plug one 1000-watt HID into it. A leeway
of 5.5 amps is there to cover any power surges. If
the circuit is rated for 20 or more amps, it may be
used for the 1000-watt HID and a few other lowamp appliances. To find out how many amps are
drawn by each appliance, add up the number of
total watts they use, and divide by 120.
Never put a larger fuse in the fuse box than it is
rated for. The fuse is the weal< est link in the circuit.
If a 20-amp fuse is placed into a 15-amp circuit,
the fuse is able to conduct more electricity than
the wiring. This causes wires to burn rather than
the fuse. An overloaded circuit may result in a
house fire.
Use an extension cord that is at least 14-gauge
wire or heavier if the plug will not reach the outlet desired. Thick 14-gauge extension cord is more
difficult to find and may have to be constructed.
Smaller 16- or 18-gauge cord will not conduct
adequate electricity and will heat up, straining the
entire system. Cut the 14-gauge extension cord to
the exact length. The further electricity travels, the
weaker it gets and the more heat it produces,
which also strains the system.
Step Five: Always use a three-prong grounded
plug. If your home is not equipped with working
three-prong grounded outlets, buy a three-prong
grounded plug and outlet adapter. Attach the
ground wire to a grounded ferrous metal object
like a grounded metal pipe or heavy copper wire

driven into the earth to form a ground, and
screw the ground into the plug-in face. You will
be working with water under and around the
HID system. Water conducts electricity about as
well as the human body.
Step Six: Once the proper circuit is selected,
the socket and hood are mounted overhead,
and the ballast is in place (but not plugged in),
screw the HID bulb finger-tight into the socket.
Make sure the bulb is secured in the socket
tightly, but not too tight, and make certain there
is a good connection. When secure, wipe off all
smudges on the bulb to increase brightness.
Step Seven: Plug the three-prong plug into the
timer that is in the OFF position. Plug the timer
into the grounded outlet, set the timer at the
desired photoperiod, and turn the timer on.
Shazam! The ballast will hum; the lamp will flicker and slowly warm up, reaching full
brilliance in about five minutes.

This pH Chart shows the Safe Zone is between 5.8
and6.8.

Soil is made up of many mineral particles
mixed together with living and dead organic
matter that incorporates air and water. Three
basic factors contribute to the cannabis root's
ability to grow in a soil: texture, pH, and nutrient
content.
Soil texture is governed by the size and physical makeup of the mineral particles. Proper soil
texture is required for adequate root penetration, water, and oxygen retention and drainage
as well as many other complex chemical
processes.
Clay or adobe soil is made up of very small, flat
mineral particles; when it gets wet, these
minute particles pack tightly together, slowing
or stopping root penetration and water
drainage. Roots are unable to breathe because
very little or no space is left for oxygen. Water
has a very difficult time penetrating these tightly
packed soils, and once it does penetrate,
drainage is slow.
Sandy soils have much larger particles. They
permit good aeration (supply of air or oxygen)
and drainage. Frequent watering is necessary
because water retention is very low. The soil's
water- and air-holding ability and root penetration are a function of texture.
Loam soil is ideal for growing cannabis. It contains a mix of clay, silt, and sand. The different
sized particles allow a large combination of pore
spaces, so it drains well and still retains nutrients
and moisture.
To check soil texture, pick up a handful of
moist (not soggy) soil and gently squeeze it.
The soil should barely stay together and have a
kind of sponge effect when you slowly open
your hand to release the pressure. Indoor soils
that do not fulfill these requirements should be
thrown out or amended. See "Soil Amendments" below.

pH
The pH scale, from 1 to 14, measures acid-toalkaline balance. 1 is the most acidic, 7 is neutral, and 14 most alkaline. Every full point
change in pH signifies a ten-fold increase or
decrease in acidity or alkalinity. For example,
soil or water with a pH of 5 is ten times more
acidic than water or soil with a pH of 6. Water
with a pH of 5 is one hundred times more acidic
than water with a pH of 7. With a ten-fold difference between each point on the scale, accurate measurement and control is essential to a
strong, healthy garden.
Cannabis grows best in soil with a pH from 6.5
to 7.0. Within this range marijuana can properly absorb and process available nutrients most
efficiently. If the pH is too low (acidic), acid salts
chemically bind nutrients, and the roots are
unable to absorb them. An alkaline soil with a
high pH causes nutrients to become unavailable. Toxic salt buildup that limits water intake
by roots also becomes a problem. Hydroponic
solutions perform best in a pH range a little
lower than for soil. The ideal pH range for
hydroponics is from 5.8 to 6.8. Some growers
run the pH at lower levels and report no problems with nutrient uptake. The pH of organic
soil mixes is very important because it dictates
the ability of specific pH-sensitive bacteria.
Measure the pH with a soil test kit, litmus
paper, or electronic pH tester, all of which are
available at most nurseries. When testing pH,
take two or three samples and follow instructions supplied by the manufacturer "to the letter:• Soil test kits measure soil pH and primary
nutrient content by mixing soil with a chemical
solution and comparing the color of the solution
to a chart. Every one of these kits I have seen or
used is difficult for novice gardeners to achieve
accurate measurements. Comparing the color
of the soil/chemical mix to the color of the chart
is often confusing. If you use one of these kits,
make sure to buy one with good, easy-to-understand directions and ask the sales clerk for exact
recommendations on using it.

For an accurate pH test with
an electronic pH meter:
- Clean the probes of the meter after each test
and wipe away any corrosion.
- Pack the soil around the probes.
- Water soil with distilled or neutral pH water
before testing.
If using litmus paper, collect samples that
demonstrate an average of the soil. Place the
samples in a clean jar, and moisten the soil samples with distilled water. Place two pieces of the
litmus paper in the muddy water. After ten seconds, remove one of the strips of litmus paper.
Wait a minute before removing the other one.
Both pieces of litmus paper should register the
same color. The litmus paper container should
have a pH-color chart on the side. Match the
color of the litmus paper with the colors on the
chart to get a pH reading. Litmus paper will
accurately measure the acidity of the substance
to within a point. The pH readings will not be
accurate if altered by water with a high or low
pH, and the litmus paper could give a false reading if the fertilizer contains a color-tracing agent.
Electronic pH testers are economical and convenient. less expensive pH meters are accurate
enough for casual use. More expensive models
are quite accurate. Pay special attention to the
soil moisture when taking a pH test with an
electronic meter. The meters measure the electrical current between two probes and are
designed to work in moist soil. If the soil is dry,
the probes do not give an accurate reading. I
prefer electronic pH meters over the reagent test
kits and litmus paper because they are convenient, economical, and accurate. Once purchased, you can measure pH thousands of
times with an electronic meter, while the chemical test kits are good for about a dozen tests.
Perpetual pH-metering devices are also available and most often used to monitor hydroponic nutrient solutions.
Check the pH of irrigation water. In dry climates, such as the desert Southwest United
States, Spain, Australia, etc., irrigation water is

•

•

often alkaline with a pH above 6.0. The water in
rainy climates, such as the Pacific Northwest of
North America, the United Kingdom,
Netherlands, and maritime Northern Europe, is
often acidic with a pH below 6.0. The pH and
EC of water supplies in municipalities and cities
can also change throughout the year in some
countries. After repeated watering, water with a
pH that is too high or low will change the pH of
the growing medium, especially in organically
amended soils. Raw-water pH above 6.0 helps
keep fertilizer mixes from becoming too acidic.
Climatic conditions can also affect irrigation
water pH. For example, the pH can become
more acidic in late autumn, when leaves fall and
decompose. large municipalities carefully monitor and correct the pH, and there are few waterqualily problems. Check the pH at least once a
week.
Cannabis will grow in almost any soil"', but it
flourishes when the pH is between 6.5 and 7.
Commercial potting soil almost never has a pH
above 7.5. A lower pH is more common, even
as low as 5.5. Some potting soils purchased at
a nursery are pH balanced and near a neutral 7.
However, most potting soils have a tendency to
be acidic. The easiest way to stabilize soil pH is
to mix in one cup of fine dolomite lime per
cubic foot (0.25 liters) of potting soil. Mix
dolomite lime thoroughly into dry soil. Remix
the soil in the container after it has been
watered.
Fine Dolomite Lime has long been a favorite
pH stabilizer for gardeners. It is difficult to apply
too much as long as it is thoroughly mixed into
soil. Dolomite has a neutral pH of 7, and it can
never raise the pH beyond 7.0. It stabilizes the
pH safely. Compensate for acidic soil by mixing
dolomite with soil before planting. It will help

Do not use wood ashes on indoor gardens
unless you know their origin, pH, and nutrient
content. You can add cottonseed meal, lemon
peels, coffee grounds, or a high-acidity fertilizer
to lower pH in soil to below 7.0.
Commercial potting soils and soilless mixes
are often acidic and the pH seldom needs to be
lowered. If new soil pH is under 6 or above 8,
it is easier and less expensive in the long run to
change soil rather than experiment with chang·
ing the pH. Fertilizers are naturally acidic and
lower the pH of the growing medium. Sulfur
will lower the pH, if necessary, but it is tricky to
use. 1advise using an acid to alter the pH. Add
distilled white vinegar at the rate of one tea·

not, add more vinegar in small increments.
Often when using vinegar, the pH drifts up
overnight.
Check the pH the next day.
Hydroponic growers use phosphoric and nitric
acid to lower pH. Calcium nitrate can also be
used, but is less common. Keep a close eye on
the pH and control it accordingly. After altering

the pH, check it, and then
check it again daily to make
sure it remains stable.
Aspirin also lowers the pH.

tions appear to be triggered

Soil Temperature
Raising the soil temperature speeds the chem·
ical process and can hasten nutrient uptake.
Ideally, the soil temperature should range from
65-70°F (18-24°C) for the most chemical activity. Warm the soil with soil-heating cables or a
heating pad. Fasten heating cables to a board
or table and set a heat-conducting pad on top of
the cables to distribute heat evenly. Set cuttings
and seedlings in shallow flats or growing trays
on top of the heat-conducting pad. The added
heat speeds root growth when soil temperature
is below 6s•F (1a•q .
Soil heating cables cost much less than soil
heating pads but must be installed, whereas the
pads are ready to use. Most commercial nurs·
eries carry cables, and hydroponic stores carry
heating pads. When rooting clones, a heating
pad or cables virtually ensure success and expe·
dite root growth.
Cold soil slows water and nutrient uptake and
stifles growth. Growers often overwater when

the soil is too cold or the room cools unexpectedly, which further slows growth. Pots on cold
concrete floors stay as cold as the concrete,
which is always colder than the ambient temperature. Increase soil temperature by moving
pots up off the floor a few inches. Set them on
an insulating board or piece of Styrofoam" '·
Soil temperatures that climb above 75°F (39°
C) dehydrate roots, and at higher temperatures
the roots actually cook! It is relatively easy to
heat the soil in a pot. If the light or any heat
source is too close to small pots, it can easily
heat up the outside layer of soil where the
majority of the feeder roots are located. Once
destroyed, roots take one or two weeks to grow
back. Two weeks accounts for one quarter of
the flowering cycle!
The more feeder root hairs there are to absorb
water and nutrients, the faster and stronger
plants will grow. Once roots go beyond their
comfort zone, they send stress signals to foliage
and stomata via hormones to close and conserve moisture.
Oxygen is essential for clones that are growing
roots. Water holds under one percent dissolved
oxygen at 70°F (21 °C). Bump the temperature
up to 85°F (29°C) and it holds less than 0.5 percent oxygen.

Root temperatures below 40°F (4°C) make
water expand, which causes cell damage.
Temperatures above 92°F (33°C) cause excessive vapor pressure within the roots, which can
cause damage. At high temperatures roots send
stress signals to shut the leaves down before
damage can occur.

Potting Soil
Potting soil fresh out of the bag often fulfills all
requirements for a growing medium: good texture
that allows good root penetration, water retention,
and good drainage, a stable pH between 6 and 7,
and a minimum supply of nutrients.
Premium fast-draining soils with good texture
that will not break down quickly are the best
choice. Potting soils found at nurseries are often
formulated with a wetting agent and retain
water and air evenly, drain well, and allow easy
root penetration. Organic potting soils are very
popular. These soils are often fortified with
organic nutrients including readily available
high-nitrogen worm castings. Potting soils are
very heavy, and transportation costs tend to
keep them somewhat localized. There are
many good brands of high-quality potting soil.
Ask your nursery person for help in selecting
one for fast-growing vegetables.

soil or soilless mix is a dusty, messy job that
takes little space. To cut down on dust, lightly
mist the pile with water several times when mixing. Always wear a respirator to avoid inhaling

The texture of soilless mixes-for rapid-growing
cannabis- should be coarse, light, and spongy.
Such texture allows drainage with sufficient
moisture and air retention, as well as providing
good root penetration qualities. Fine soilless
mix holds more moisture and works best in
smaller containers. Soilless mixes that contain
more perlite and sand drain faster, making them
easier to fertili ze heavily without excessive fertilizer-salt buildup. Vermiculite and peat hold
water longer and are best used in small pots
that require more water retention.
The pH is generally near neutral, 7.0. If using
more than 15 percent peat, which is acidic, add
appropriate dolomite or hydrated lime to correct
and stabilize the pH. Check the pH regularly
every week. Soilless mixes are composed mainly of mineral particl es that are not affected by
organic decomposition, which could change the
pH. The pH is affected by acidic fertilizers or by
water with a high or low pH. Check the pH of
the runoff water to ensure the pH in the medium is not too acidic.

Place a seed or cutting in a moist peat pot or
root cube. If the little container does not have a
planting hole, make one with a chopstick, large
nail, or something similar. Set the seed or clone
stem in the hole. Crimp the top over the seed
or around the stem so it makes constant contact
with the medium. In one to three weeks, roots
grow and show through the side of the cube.
Cut the nylon mesh from peat pots before it gets
entangled with roots. To transplant, set the peat
pot or root cube in a pre-drilled hole in a rockwool block or into larger pot. Clones and
seedlings suffer little or no transplant shock
when transplanted properly.
Check moisture levels in peat pots and root
cubes daily. t<eep them evenly moist but not
drenched. Root cubes and peat pots do not
contain any nutrients. Seedlings do not require
nutrients for the first week or two. Feed
seedlings after the first week and clones as soon
as they are rooted.
Coarse sharp sand, fine vermiculite, and perlite
work well to root cuttings. Sand and perlite are
fast draining, which helps prevent damping-off.
Vermiculite holds water longer and makes
cloning easier. A good mix is one third of each:
sand, fine perlite, and fin e vermiculite.
Premixed seed starter mixes sold under such
brand names as Sunshine Mix and Terra-Lite are
the easiest and most economical mediums in
which to root clones and start seedlings.
Soilless mix also allows for complete control of
critical nutrient and root stimulating hormone
additives, which are essential to asexual propa'gation.

Soil Amendments
Soil amendments increase the soil's air-,
water-, and nutrient-retaining abilities. Soil
amendments fall into two categories: mineral
and organic.
Mineral amendments are near neutral on the
pH scale and contain few, if any, available nutri-

ents. Mineral amendments decompose through
weathering and erosion. Add mineral amendments to augment air and increase drainage.
They have the advantage of creating no bacterial activity to alter nutrient content and pH of the
growing medium. Dry mineral amendments are
also very lightweight and much easier to move
in and out of awkward spaces.
Perlite is sand or volcanic glass expanded by
heat. It holds water and nutrients on its many
irregular surfaces, and it works especially well
for aerating the soil. This is a good medium to
increase drainage during vegetative and flowering growth, and it does not promote fertilizersalt build-up. Versatile perlite is available in
three main grades: fine, medium and coarse.
Most growers prefer the coarse grade as a soil
amendment. Perlite should make up one third
or less of any mix to keep it from floating and
stratifying the mix.
Pumice, volcanic rock, is very light and holds
water, nutrients, and air, in its many catacomblike holes. It is a good amendment for aerating
the soil and retaining moisture evenly. But like
perlite, pumice floats and should constitute less
than a third of any mix to avoid problems.
Hydroclay is used more and more as a soil
amendment in containers. The large expanded
clay pellets expedite drainage and hold air within the growing medium. See Chapter Twelve
"Hydroponics" for more information.
Vermiculite is mica processed and expanded
by heat. It holds water, nutrients, and air within
its fiber and gives body to fast-draining soils.
Fine vermiculite holds too much water for cuttings, but does well when mixed with a fastdraining medium. This amendment holds more
water than perlite or pumice. Used in hydroponic wick systems, vermiculite holds and wicks
much moisture. Vermiculite comes in three
grades: fine, medium, and coarse. Use fine vermiculite as an ingredient in cloning mixes. If
fine is not available, crush coarse or medium
vermiculite between your hands, rubbing palms
back and forth. Coarse is the best choice as a
soil amendment.

Pumice is lighweight.

Vermiculite is lightweight cmd absorbent.

decomposition. If they do not contain at least
1.5 percent nitrogen, the organic amendment
will get it from the soil, robbing roots of valuable
nitrogen. When using organic amendments,
make sure they are thoroughly composted (at
least one year) and releasing nitrogen rather
than stealing it from the soil. A dark, rich color
is a good sign of fertility.
Rich, thoroughly composted organic matter
amends texture and supplies nutrients. Leaf
mold, garden compost (at least one year old),
and many types of thoroughly composted
manure usually contain enough nitrogen for
their decomposition needs and release nitrogen
rather than using it. Purchase quality organic
amendments at a reputable nursery. Look carefully at the descriptive text on the bag to see if it
is sterilized and is guaranteed to contain no
harmful insects: larvae, eggs, and fungi or bad
microorganisms. Contaminated soil causes
many problems that are easily averted by using
a clean mix.
Garden compost and leaf mold are usually
rich in organic nutrients and beneficial organisms that speed nutrient uptake, but they can be
full of harmful pests and diseases, too. For
example, compost piles are a favorite breeding
ground for cutworms and beetle larvae. Just
one cutworm in a container means certain
death for the defenseless marijuana plant.
Garden compost is best used in outdoor gardens and not indoors. See below for more
information on garden compost.
Manure: Barnyard manure, a great fertilizer for
outdoor gardens, often contains toxic levels of
salt and copious quantities of weed seeds and
fungus spores that disrupt an indoor garden. If
using manure, purchase it in bags that guarantee its contents. There are many kinds of
manure: cow, horse, rabbit, and chicken, etc.
See Chapter Eleven . for a complete rundown
on manures, all of which help retain water and
improve soil texture when used as soil amendments. When mixing manures as amendments,

purchasing all of the components. Use garden
soil or compost only if they are top quality and
devoid of harmful pests and diseases. Use
only the richest, darkest garden soil with a
good texture. Amend the soil by up to 80 percent to improve water retention and drainage.
Even a soil that drains well in the outdoor garden needs amending to drain properly
indoors. Check the pH of the garden soil
before digging to ensure it is between 6.0 and
7.0. Add fine dolomite to stabilize and buffer
pH. Check pH several times after mixing to
ensure it is stable.
Solarize garden soil by putting it out in the
sun in a plastic bag for a few weeks. Turn the
bag occasionally to heat it up on all sides.
Make sure the bag receives full sun and heats
up to at least l40°F (60°C). This will kill the
bad stuff and let the beneficial bacteria live.
You can also sterilize soil by laying it out on a
Pyrex plate and baking it at 160°F for 10 minutes, or microwave it for two minutes at the
highest setting. It is much easier and more
profitable in the end to purchase good potting
soil at a nursery.

Compost is outstanding. It solves most problems outdoors. Compost is an excellent soil
amendment. It holds nutrients and moisture
within its fiber. However, using backyard compost indoors is tricky.
Some growers have no trouble with organic
composts, but others have bad luck and even
Ipse their entire crop when growing in backyard compost. Good compost recipes are
available from monthly publications such as

Sunset, Organic Gardening, National
Gardening, etc., or from the companies specializing in organic composts. Outdoor growers love compost. It is inexpensive, abundant,
and works wonders to increase water reten·
tion and drainage. It also increases nutrient
uptake because of biological activity. Indoors,

compost is not very practical to use in contain·
ers. It could also have unwanted pests. If
using compost indoors, make sure it is well·
rotted and screened.
A good compost pile includes manure- the
older the better. Manure from horse stalls or
cattle feedlots is mixed wi th straw or sawdust
bedding. Sawdust uses available nitrogen and
is also acidic and not recommended. Look for
the oldest, and most-rotted manure. Well-rot·
ted manure is less prone to have viable weed
seeds and pests. Fresh nitrogen-packed grass
clippings are one of my favorites to use in a
compost pile. Put your hand down deep into
a pile of grass clippings. The temperature one
or two feet down in such a pile ranges from
120° to 180°F (49° to 82°C). Heat generated
by chemical activity kills pests, breaks down
the foliage, and liberates the nutrients.
Build compost piles high, and keep turning
them. Good compost pile recipes include the
addition of organic trace elements, enzymes,
and the primary nutrients. The organic matter
used should be ground up and in the form of
shredded leaves and grass. Do not use large
woody branches that could take years to
decompose.
Before using compost indoors, pour it
through 0.25-inch mesh hardware cloth
(screen) to break up the humus before mixing
with soil. Place a heavy-duty framed screen
over a large garbage can or a wheelbarrow to
catch the sifted compost. Return earthworms
found on the screen to the medium and kill
cutworms. Make sure all composts are well
rotted and have cooled before mixing with
indoor soil. For more information about com-

posting. see Let II Rot!, Third Edition, by Stu
Campbell, Storey Press, Prowal, VT.
Some growers mix up to 30 percent perlite
into organic potting soil that contains lots of
worm castings. Heavy worm castings compact
soil and leave little space for air to surround
roots. Adding perlite or similar amendments
aerates the soil and improves drainage.

Growing Medium Disposal
Disposing of used growing medium can be as
big a problem as finding the proper soil. Most
soilless mixes and soils contain perlite, which
leaves white telltale traces when dumped anywhere. Grow soil is also packed with incriminat·
ing cannabis roots. The plug was pulled on
more than one grow-show because soil residuals were found in the back yard.
Dry soil is easier to work and transport. Press
and rub dry soil through a 0.25 to O.S·inch
screen to remove roots, stems, and foliage.
Screening also transforms the cast-container
shape of the soil to an innocuous form. Once
the roots are removed, dry, used soil can be
bagged up or compacted. Place the dry soil in a
trash compactor to make it smaller and more
manageable. Do not throw the spent growing
medium into your trash can. Remember, it is
not a crime for law enforcement in America to
dig through your garbage. In fact, picking
through a suspected grower's garbage is a tactic
often used by American authorities to secure a
search warrant. Remove the depleted soil from
the property. Take it to the dump or dispose of
it in a very discreet locale. Never throw away the
transporting bags with the used soil. Reuse the
bags.
Used indoor growing mediums make excel·
lent outdoor amendments when mixed with
compost and garden soil. Do not reuse the
depleted soil in outdoor pots. Many of the same
problems that occur indoors will happen in out·
door pots.

Grow Medium Problems
These maladies are caused by growing medium problems but manifest as nutrient problems. The solution is found within the growing
medium.
When water is abundant in the growing medium, roots easily absorb it. Roots use more energy to absorb more water as it becomes scarce.

Visible Signs of Grow Medium Stress
Dry, crispy, brittle leaves
Patchy or inconsistent leaf color
Yellow leaf edges that worsen
Crispy, burnt leaf edges
Chlorosis-yellowing between veins
while veins remain green
Irregular blotches on leaves
Purple stems and leaf stems
Leaf edges curl up or down
Leaf tip curls down
Super-soft pliable leaves
Branch tips stop growing
Leggy growth

Finally, the point comes when the substrate
retains more moisture than it surrenders, and
the roots receive no water. A good growing
medium readily yields its bank of stored water
and nutrients. A poor medium does not pass
enough nutrients to a plant's roots. The more
easily cannabis absorbs nutrients, the higher the
yield.
The cation-exchange-capacity (CEC) of a growing medium is its capacity to hold cations that
are available for uptake by the roots. The CEC is
the number of cation charges held in 3.5 ounces
{100 gm) or 100 cc of soil and is measured in
milli-Equivalents (mEq) or Centi-Moles/kg on a
scale from 0-100. CEC of 0 means the substrate
holds no available cations for roots. CEC of 100
means the medium always holds cations available for root uptake. Growing mediums that
carry a negative electrical charge are the best.

Containers
Container preference is often a matter of convenience, cost, and availability. But the size,
shape, and color of a container can affect the
size and the health of a plant as well as the versatility of the garden. Containers come in all

This chart shows different growing mediums' ability to hold positive charges that are
ready for root uptake. Note the zero CEC of
perlite and rockwool. Roots must be constantly bathed in nutrients. Other mediums
do not provide a constant flow of nutrients
and the CEC regulates the ability to hold a
positive charge to make nutrients available
for root uptake.

will grow in any clean container that has not

breathe better than plastic or metal pots. Heavy
clay pots are brittle and absorb moisture from

Rigid plastic pots are the most commonly used
containers in grow rooms. Growing in inexpensive, readily available containers is brilliant
because they allow each plant to be cared for

Grow bags are one of my favori te containers.
Inexpensive, long-lasting grow bags take up little space and are lightweight. A box of 100 3gallon (13 L) bags weighs less than 5 pounds
(2.3 kg) and measures less than a foot square.
One hundred 3-gallon (1 3 L) grow bags can be
stored in two 3-gallon (13 L) bags. Imagine
storing 100 rigid pots in the same space!
Grow bags are very easy to wash and reuse.

Wash each one by hand the next day and fill

because they are so practical.
The potting soil sack can be used as a container. The moist soil inside the bag holds its shape
well, and the bags expand and contract with the
soil, lessening the chance of burned root tips
that grow down the side of pots.
Fiber and paper-pulp pots are popular with
growers who move their plants outdoors. The
bottoms of the pots habitually rot out. Painting
the inside of the fiber container with latex paint
will keep the bottom from rotting for severaI
crops.

Grow beds can be installed right on the earthen floor of a garage or basement. If drainage is
poor, a layer of gravel or a dry well can be made
under the bed. Some growers use a jackhammer to remove the concrete floor in a basement
to get better drainage. An easier option is to cut
a hole in the basement floor and install a dry
well. Knocking holes in basement floors could
cause water seepage, where water tables are
high. When it rains, the water may collect
undern eath; the garden seldom needs watering,
but plants are kept too wet.
A raised bed with a large soil mass can be built
up organically after several crops. To hasten
organic activity within the soil, add organic seaweed, manure, and additives. When mixing soil
or adding amendments, use the best possible
organic components and follow organic principles. There should be good drainage and the
soil should be as deep as possible, 12-24 inches (30-60 em).

set on a concrete floor. The basement beds are
below sea level and filled with outstanding Dutch
cannabis. They are able to treat the beds similar
to outdoor soil beds, but when watered heavily,
water runs out on the floor and it must be
mopped up. They also have a problem with ventilation. The ambient climate is naturally humid
and the extra water in the large basement
increases humidity to above 90 percent, day and
night. They employ a large extraction fan and a
relatively small intake fan. Air is pulled through
the long narrow basement room quickly and efficiently to evacuate moisture and lower the
humidity. Even with this much soil, they have to
flush individual beds at least once every four
weeks to avoid nutrient buildup.
Much heat can be generated by decomposing
organic matter, and it warms the room.
Ventilation lowers heat and humidity, and helps
keep the room free of pests and diseases. An
organic garden sounds great, but it is a lot of
work to replicate the great outdoors. Most organic growers opt for organic liquid fertilizers and a
bagged commercial organic soil mix.
Another drawback to raised beds is that the
crop will take a few days longer to mature than if
it were grown in containers. But the longer wait
is offset by a larger harvest.

Dr~inage

Flush containers with a mild nutrient solution eve!)'

All containers need some form of drainage.
Drainage holes allow excess water and nutrient
solution to flow freely out the bottom of a container. Drainage holes should let water drain easily, but not be so big that growing medium washes out onto the floor. Containers should have at
lt?ast two half-inch (1 .2 em) holes per square foot
of bottom. Most pots have twice this amount. To
slow drainage and keep soil from washing out of
the large holes, add a one-inch (3 em) layer of
gravel in the bottom of the pot. Surface tension
created by the varying sizes of soil and rock particles cause water to be retained at the bottom of
the container. Line pots with newspaper if
drainage is too fast or if soil washes out drain
holes. This will slow drainage, so be wary!

often causes root rot. To avoid water-logging
soil and roots, set containers up an inch or two
on blocks when using trays.
Nursery trays used for rooting cuttings and
growing seedlings must have good drainage
throughout the entire bottom. Once clones and
seedlings are in place in the tray, the tray should
always drain freely with no standing water in the
bottom.

and more efficient to toss it out and replace it
with a healthy one.
Roots soon hit the sides of containers where
they grow down and mat up around the bottom. The unnatural environment inside the container often causes a thick layer of roots to grow
alongside the container walls and bottom. This
portion of the root zone is the most vulnerable
to moisture and heat stress and is the most
exposed.

Container Shape, Size, and
Maintenance
Popular pot shapes include rectangular and
cylindrical. Growers prefer taller pots rather
than wide, squat containers because the
cannabis root system penetrates deeply. Of all
the gardens I have visited, squat pots were few
and far between. Growers I queried said squat
pots may hold more soil for their stature, but
they do not produce as extensive a root system.
The volume of a container can easily dictate
the size of a plant. Cannabis is an annual; it
grows very fast and requires a lot of root space
for
sustained,
vigorous
development.
Containers should be big enough to allow for a
strong root system, but just big enough to contain the root system before harvest. If the container is too small, roots are confined, water and
nutrient uptake is limited, and growth slows to
a crawl. But if the container is too big, it requires
too much expensive growing medium and
becomes heavy and awkward to move.
Marijuana roots develop and elongate quickly,
growing down and out, away from the main
taproot. For example, about midsummer, nurseries have unsold tomato plants that are still in
small 4-inch (10 em) pots and one-gallon (4 L)
containers. The stunted plants have blooming
flowers and ripe fruit. But few branches extend
much beyond the sides of the container; the
plants are tall and leggy with curled down leaves
and an overall stunted, sickly appearance.
These plants are pot- or root-bound. Once a
plant deteriorates to this level, it is often easier

months. 3- to 6-gallon containers are good
for three to four months of rapid plant
growth.

Square containers ore easy to bunch together when

Soil shrinks when dry; it causes a gap to farm alongside the container wall.

Roots grow quickly and soon encircle the inside of the
container.

.

Cultivate the top layer of soil with a fark to break up tile crusty surface.

When soil dries in a pot, it becomes smaller,
contracting and separating from the inside of
the container wall. This condition is worst in
smooth plastic pots. When this crack develops,
frail root hairs located in the gap quickly die
when they are exposed to air whistling down
this crevice. Water also runs straight down this
crack and onto the floor. You may think the pot
was watered, but the root ball remains dry.
Avoid such killer cracks by cultivating the soil

surface and running your finger around the
inside lip of the pots. Cultivate the soil in pots
every few days and maintain evenly moist soil
to help keep root hairs on the soil perimeter
from drying out.
Do not place containers in direct heat. If soil
temperature climbs beyond 75°F (24°C), it can
damage roots. Pots that are in direct heat
should be shaded with a piece of plastic or
cardboard.

. __,...-

Lightly cultivate the soil surface, so water penetrates
evenly. Be careful not to disturb roots.

A 1 to 2-inch (3-5 em) layer of hydro clay
mulch on soil surface keeps soil surface moist.
Roots are able to grow along the surface, and
the soil does not need to be cultivated. The
mulch also decreases evaporation and helps
keep irrigation water from damaging roots or
splashing.

light does not penetrate and slow root growth.
If roots around the outside of the root ball start
turning green, you know they are receiving
direct light. Remedy the problem by painting
the inside of the container with a non-toxic latex
paint.

Introduction
Insects, mites, and maggots slither into grow
rooms eating, reproducing, and wasting weed.
Outdoors, they live everywhere they can. Indoors,
they live anywhere you let them. Fungi are present in the air at all times. They may be introduced
by an infected plant or from air containing fungus
spores. Fungi will settle down and grow if climatic conditions are right. Pests, fungi, and diseases
can be prevented, but if allowed to grow
unchecked, extreme control measures are often
necessary to eradicate them.
Simple hygiene in the grow room keeps pests ond
diseases in check.

Dirty grow rooms help cause pest
and disease problems.

---------~~~
Sweep the grow room floor every few days to
avoid problems with pests and diseases.

Prevention
Cleanliness is the key to insect and fungus prevention. The grow room should be totally
enclosed so the environment can be controlled
easily. Keep the floor clean. Keep all debris off
soil surface. Do not use mulch. Insects and fungi
like nice hideaway homes found in dirty, dank corners, and under dead decaying leaves or rotting
mulch. Growers and their tools often transport
many microscopic pests, diseases, and fungi that
could ultimately destroy the garden. This does not
mean growers and their tools have to be hospital
clean every time they enter a grow room, even
though that would be nice. It does mean normal
and regular sanitary precautions must be taken.
Growers who wear clean clothes and use clean
tools reduce problems considerably. A separate
set of indoor tools is easy to keep clean. Pests,
diseases, and fungi habitually ride from plant to
plant on dirty tools. Disinfect tools by dipping in
rubbing alcohol or washing with soap and hot
water after using them on each diseased plant.
Another quick way to sterilize pruners is with a
hand-held torch. A quick heating with the torch
will sterilize metal tools immediately.
Personal cleanliness is fundamental to preventing pests and diseases. Wash your hands before
touching foliage and after handling diseased
plants. Smart growers do not walk around the
buggy outdoor garden and then visit the indoor
garden. They do it vice versa. Think before entering the indoor garden and possibly contaminating
it. Did you wall< across a lawn covered with rust
fungi or pet the dog that just came in from the
garden outside? Did you just fondle your spider
mite-infested split-leaf philodendron in the living
room? Avoid such problems by washing your
hands, and changing shirt, (>ants, and shoes

before entering an indoor garden.
Once a crop has been grown in potting soil or
soilless mix, throw out the grow medium. Some
growers brag about using the same old potting
soil over and over, unaware that this savings is
repaid with a diminished harvest. Used soil may
harbor harmful pests and diseases that have
developed immunity to sprays. Starting a new
crop in new potting soil will cost more up front
but will eliminate many potential problems.
Used soil makes excellent outdoor gard en soil.
Be careful when discarding used soil! Growers
in Eugene, Oregon, tossed their outdoor soil out
in the backyard for many years. The soil was
about 50 percent white perlite and had a distinctive color. This oversight eventually led to the
growers' arrest.
Once potting soil is used, it loses much of the
fluff in the texture, and compaction becomes a
problem. Roots penetrate compacted soil slowly,
and there is little room for oxygen, which restricts
nutrient uptake. Used potting soil is depleted of
nutri ents. A plant with a slow start is a perfect
target fo r disease, and worst of all, it will yield
less!
Companion planting helps discourage insects
outdoors. Pests have nowhere to go indoors, so
companion planting is not viable in the grow
rooms.
Plant insect- and fu ngus-resistant strains of
marijuana. If buying·seeds from one of the many
seed companies, always check for disease resist·
ance. In general, Cannabis indica is the most
resistant to pests, and sativa is more resistant to
fungal attacks. Choose mother plants that you
know are resistant to pests and diseases.
Keep plants healthy and growing fast at all
times. Disease attacks sick plants first. Strong
plants tend to grow faster than pests and diseases can spread.
Forced air circulation makes life miserable for
pests and diseases. Pests hate wind because
holding on to plants is difficult, and flight pat'hs
are haphazard. Fungal spores have little time to
settle in a breeze and grow poorly on wind-dried
soil, stems, and leaves.
Ventilation changes the humidity of a room
quickly. In fact, a vent fan attached to a humidistat is often the most effective form of humidity
control. Mold was a big problem in one of the
grow rooms that I visited. The room did not have
a vent fan. Upon entering the enclosed room, the

Healthy plants are easy ta keep strong
and are able to fight off pests and diseases.

humid air was overpowering. It was terrible! The
environment was so humid that roots grew from
plant stems. The grower installed a vent fan to
suck out moist, stale air. The humidity dropped
from nearly 100 percent to around 50 percent.
The mold problem disappeared, and harvest volume increased.
Indoor horticulturists who practice all the preventative measures have fewer problems with
pests and diseases. It is much easier to prevent
the start of a disease than it is to wipe out an
infestation. If pests and diseases are left
unchecked, they can devastate the garden in a
few short weeks.

Control
Sometimes, even when all preventative measures are taken, pests and diseases still slink in
and set up housekeeping. First, they establish a
base on a weak, susceptible plant. Once set up,
they launch an all-out assault on the rest of the
garden. They move out in all directions from the
infested base, taking over more and more space,
until they have conquered the entire garden. An
infestation can happen in a matter of days. Most
insects lay thousands of eggs in short periods of
time. These eggs hatch and grow into mature
adults within a few weeks. For example, if 100
microscopic munchers each laid I 000 eggs during their two weeks of life and these eggs grew
into adults, two weeks later 100,000 young adults
would lay 100 eggs each. By the end of the
month, there would be t 00,000,000 pests attack-

Sprays often kill adults only. In general, sprays
should be applied soon after eggs hatch so young
adults are caught in their weakest stage of life.
Very lightweight (low viscosity) horticultural oil
spray works well alone or as an additive to help
kill larvae and eggs.
The availability of some sprays can be seasonal,
especially in more rural areas. Garden sections of
stores are changed for the winter, but extra stock
is sometimes kept in a storage room. Look for
bargains on sprays at season-end sales. Today,
there are many indoor grow stores that carry pest
and disease controls all year round.

Insect Control
Indoor gardeners have many options to control
insects and fungi. Prevention and cleanliness are
at the top of the control list. A logical progression
to pest and disease control is outlined in the
chart on this page. (Note that it begins with
cleanliness!)
Manual removal is just what the name implies
- smashing all pests and their eggs in sight
between the thumb and forefinger or between
two sponges.
I like natural-organic sprays such as pyrethrum
and neem and use harsh chemicals only as a last
resort. Any spray, no matter how benign, always
seems to slow plant growth a litl'le. Stomata
become clogged when foliage is sprayed and
covered with a filmy residue. Stomata stay

Yellow sticky traps are used to monitor pest populations CIS well as to control small flying insects.

Sprays and Traps
Chemical fungicides, insecticides, and
miticides
I do not recommend using chemical fungicides,
fungistats, insecticides, or miticides on plants that
are destined for human consumption. Most contact sprays that do not enter the plant system are
approved for edible fruits and vegetables.
However, there are numerous ways to control
fung i, diseases, and pests without resorting to

and avoid spraying for two weeks before harvest.
Read all labels thoroughly before use.
Use only contact sprays that are approved for

chemicals. On the previous page is a chart of
common chemicals with their trade names and
the insects they control.

Spreader-Sticker for Pesticides
Spreader-stickers improve and promote wetting
and increase sticking and absorption through
foliage. Spreader-sticker products increase effectiveness of fertilizers, fu ngicides, insecticides, etc.
They are especially important to use wh en plants
develop a waxy coating of resin. Spreader-stickers also impair insects' respiration mechanisms
and function as pesticides. One of my favorite
spreader-sti~ke rs is Coco-Wet from Spray-NGrow.

Abamectin
Ingredients: Abamectin derivatives include
emamectin and milbemectin. Does not bioaccumulate. Used extensively on hops; abamectin is
not truly systemic. It is absorbed from the exterior of foliage to other leaf parts, especially young
leaves, in the process of translaminar activity.
Controls: Russet and spider mites, fire ants,

L - ~.iqu ld
WP - Wettable Powder
0 - Oil
G • Glandular
leafminers, and nematodes.
Mixing: Dilute in water. Mix 0.25 teaspoon
(0.125 cl) per gallon (3.8 L). Use a wetting agent.
Application: Spray. Works best when temperature is above 70°F (2 1•q . Repeat applications
every seven to ten days.
Persistence: One day.
Forms: Liquid.
Toxicity: Toxic to mammals, fish, and honeybees in high concentrations. Sucking insects are
subject to control while beneficials are not hurt.
Safety: Wear gloves, mask, and safety glasses.

Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and other
Bacillus species
Ingredients: Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is the
best known of several bacteria that are fatal to
caterpillars, larvae, and maggots.
Caterpillars, larvae, and maggots all eat Bt bacteria, which can be applied as a spray, dust, or
granules. Inject liquid Bt into stalks to kill borers.
Shortly after they ingest it, their appetite is ruined,
and they stop eating. Within a few days they
shrivel up and die; cabbage loopers, cabbage-

worms, corn earworms, cutworms, gypsy moth
larvae, and hornworm s are controlled.
Commercial Bt products do not reproduce within
insect bodies, so several applications may be necessary to control an infestati on. Microbial Bt bacteria are nontoxic to animals (humans), beneficial
insects, and plants; however, some people do
develop an allergic reacti on. Commercial Bt
products do not contain living Bt bacteria, but the
Bt toxin is extremely perishable. Keep within prescribed temperature range, and apply according
to the directions. Most effective on young caterpillars, larvae, and maggots, so apply as soon as
they are spotted.
Get the most out of Bt applica ti ons by adding a
UV inhibitor, spreader-sticl<er, and a feeding stimulant such as Entice<tO, l<onsumeoo or PheastOI). Bt
is completely brol<en down by UV light in one to
three days.
13. thuringiensis var. kurstaf<i (Btk)- introduced
on the market in the early 1960s-is the most
popular Bt. Toxic to many moth and caterpillar
larvae including most of the species that feed on
flowers and vegetables. Sold under many trade
names DiPe/(10, BioBitov, Jave/inoo, etc., Btk is also
available in a microencapsulated form, M-TrakM,
Mattchl,o, etc. The encapsulation extends the
effective life on foliage to more than a week.
B. thuringiensis var. aizawai (Bta) is effective
against hard-to-kill budworms, borers, armyworms and pests that have built up a resistance
to Btk.
B. thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bt-i) is effective
against the larvae of mosquitoes, black flies, and
fungus gnats. Look for Gnatro)OI), VectobacQu, and
Bacrimos 111. All are lethal to larvae. Adults do not
feed on plants and are not affected. Fungus gnats
can cause root problems including rot. Use Bti to
get rid of them as soon as they are identified.
8. thuringiensis var. morrisoni is a new strain of
Bt under development for insect larvae with a
high pH in their guts.
B. thuringiensis var. san diego (13tsd) targets the
larvae of Colorado potato beetles and elm beetle
adults and other leaf beetles.
13. tlwringiensis var. tenebrionis (Btt) is lethal to
Colorado potato beetle larvae.
8. cereus helps control damping-off and rootkn ot fun gus. It flourishes in water-saturated
mediums and promotes beneficial fungus that
attacks the diseases.
B. subtilis is a soil-dwelling bacterium that curbs

Fusarium, Pythium, and Rhizoctonia that cause
damping-off. It is commercially available under
the brand names Epic<rO, Kodiac<ru, Rhi zo-Pius<1u,
Serenade®, etc. Soak seeds and apply as a soildrench.
B. popilliae colonize larvae and grub bodies that
consume it, causing them to turn milky-white
before dying. It is often called
milky spore disease. It is most
effective against Japanese beetle
grubs.

azadirachtin, confuses growth hormones and
pests never mature into adults to produce more
young. It is most effective against young insects
and is available in various concentrations. It also
contains N-P-K and trace elements.

Precautions:
Cooking or heating preparations can destroy
active ingredients. To draw out (extract) ingredients, mince plant and soak in mineral oil for a
couple of days. Add this oil to the water including a little detergent or soap to emulsify the oil

and soaps are good wetting-sticking agents for
these preparations. Soap dissolves best if a teaspoon (0. 75 cl) of alcohol is also added to each
quart {0.9 L) of mix.

Ingredients: Nicotine is a non-persistent pesti·
cide derived from tobacco, Nicoliana tabacum. It
is a stomach poison, contact poison, and respiratory poison. This very poisonous compound
affects the neuromuscular system, causing pests
to go into convulsions and die. Nicotine sulfate is
the most common form.
Caution: Do not swallow any or this vile poison,
and avoid skin contact. Do not use around night·

Oil, horticultural
Ingredients: Often underrated and overl ooked
as an insecticide and miticide, horticultural oil is
very popular in greenhouses and is regaining
popularity among indoor growers. Similar to
medicinal mineral oil, horticultural oils are made

from animal (fish) oils, plant seed oils, and petroleum oils refined by removing most of the portion
that is toxic to plants. Lighter weight oil (viscosity 60·70) is less phytotoxic. Vegetable oil is also
horticultural oil.
Controls: Virtually invisible, horticultural oil kills
slow moving and immobile sucking insects, spider mites and their eggs by smothering, as well as
generally impairing their life cycle.
Caution: Do not use lubricating oils such as 3·
in-1 or motor oil!
Mixing: Mix 3J., teaspoon (0.75 cl) of oil
spray- no more than a one percent solution-per
quart (0.9 L) of water. More than a few drops
could burn tender, growing shoots.
Application: Spray foliage entirely, including
under the suface of the leaves. Apply oil sprays
up until two weeks before harvest. Repeat applications as needed. Usually three applications,
one every five to ten days, will put insects and
mites in check Lightweight-oil residue evaporates
into the air in a short time.
Persistence: Disappears in one to three days,
under normal growing conditions.
Forms: Liquid
Toxicity: Safe, non-poisonous, and non-polluting insecticide. Can become phytotoxic if too
heavy (viscosity), if applied too heavily, or when
temperatures are below 70"F (21"C), or very
humid; this slows evaporation, increasing phytotoxicity.
Safety: Wear a mask and gloves.

Oil, vegetable
Ingredients: Fatty acids and glycerides.
Controls: Lightweight vegetable oil kills slowmoving and immobile sucking insects, spider
mites, and their eggs by smothering as well as
generally interrupting their life cycles.
Caution: Vegetable oil does not kill as well as
horticultural oil.
Mixing: Mix two drops of oil spray- no more
than a one percent solution- per quart of water.
Application: Spray foliage entirely, including
under suface of leaves. Stop spraying two weeks
before harvest.
Persistence: Several days.
Forms: Liquid.
Toxicity: Not toxic to mammals or fish.
Safety: Wear a mask and gloves.

Pyrethrum
Ingredients: Pyrethrum, the
best-kn own botanical pesticide, is extracted from the
flowers of the pyrethrum
chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum coccineum and C.
cinerariifoliu.
Pyrethrin spyrethrins, cinerins, and jasmolins- are the active ingredients in natural pyrethrum and
kills insects on contact.
Pyrethrum is often combined Pyrethrum
with rotenone or ryania to
ensure effectiveness. Aerosol forms contain synergists. (See "Applica ti on" below.)
Controls: A broad-spectrum contact pesticide,
pyrethrum kills aphids, whitefli es, spider mites,
and insects including beneficials. It is very eflective to control flying insects, but they must receive
a killing knockdown dose, or they may revive and
buzz off.
Caution: Do not mix with sulfur, lime, copper,
or soaps. The high pH of these substances render it ineffective. Wash these substances off
foliage with plain water (pH below 7) before
applying pyrethrum.
Mixing: Mix in water with a pH below 7 and use
a spreader-sticker.
Application: Spot spray infested plants.
Aerosol sprays are most effective especially on
spider mites. This can burn foliage- spray is icecold when it exits the nozzle- if applied closer
than one foot. Aerosol sprays contains a synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) or MGK 264. Both
are toxic to people. Pyrethrum dissipates within
a few hours in the presence of air, HID light, and
sunlight. Overcome this limitation by applying
just before turning off the lights, the circulation,
and vent fans for the night. One manufacturer,
Whidmere®, offers encapsulated pyrethrum in
aerosol form called Exclude®. As the spray fogs
out of the nozzle, a bubble forms around each
droplet of pyrethrum mist. The outside coating
keeps the pyrethrum intact and extends its life for
several days. When a pest prances by touching
the bubble, it bursts, releasing the pyrethrum.
Liquid and wettable pyrethrum applied with a
pump-type sprayer is difficult to apply under
leaves where spider mites live.
Persistence: Effective several hours after application when the lights are on, longer when
applied after lights-out and the fan is turned off.

Forms: Wettable powder, dust, liquid, granular
bait, and aerosol.
Toxicity: Not toxic to animals and humans
wh en eaten, but becomes toxic to people wh en
inhaled. It is toxic to fish and beneficials.
Safety: Wear a mask and protective clothing
wh en applying sprays or breathing in any form of
pyrethrum, especially aerosols. Aerosols contain
toxic PBO and MGK 464- possible carcinogens
- which are easily inhaled.

Afterward, boil for two hours. Add a potassiumbased soap to increase effectiveness. Strain and
cool before spraying.
Application: Spray on foliage until saturated.
Persistence: Two to five days on the surface of
plants.
Forms: Barl<, wood chips, and shavings.
Toxicity: Safe for mammals and (possibly) beneficials.
Safety: Wear a mask and gloves.

Synthetic Pyrethroids

Rotenone

Ingredients: Synthetic pyrethroids such as permethrin and cypermethrin act as broad-spectrum,
non-selective contact insecticides and miticides.
There are more than 30 synthetic pyrethroids
available in different formul ations. Deltamethrin
is available as a sticky paint that is used as a trap
when applied to stems and colored objects.
Other pyrethroids include Allethrin, cyflutrin, fenpropathin, phenothrin, sumithrin, resmitherin,
and tefluthrin.
Controls: Aphids, whiteflies, thrips, beetles,
cockroaches, caterpill ars, and spider mites.
NOTE: Many insects and mites are resistant to
pyrethroids.
Caution: Non-selective pyrethroids kill all
insects and mites including beneficials and bees.
Mixing: Follow directions on container.
Application: Follow directions on container.
(See "Application" under "Pyrethrum" above.)
Persistence: Breaks down in one to three days.
Newer pyrethroids, such as Permethrin, stay
active the longest.
Forms: Powder, liquid, aerosol.
Toxicity: Toxic to all insects. It is somewhat
toxic to mammals.
Safety: Wear a mask and protective clothing
wh en applying sprays or breathing in any form of
pyrethrum, especially aerosols. Aerosols contain
toxic PBO and MGK 464- possible carcinogenswhich are easily inhaled.

Ingredients: Rotenone is an extract of roots of
several plants including Derris species,
Lonchocarpus species, and Tephrosia species.
This poison is a non-selective contact insecticide,
stomach poison, and slow-acting nerve poison.
Controls: Non-selective control of beetles,
caterpillars, flies, mosquitos, thrips, weevils, and
beneficial insects, but death is slow. According to
Hemp Diseases and Pests, target insects can con sume up to 30 times their lethal dose before
dying!
Caution: Kills beneficials. New evidence indicates rotenone may be toxic to people and may
cause Parkinson's disease. Use only as a last
resort!
Mixing: Follow directions on the package.
Application: Follow directions on the package.
Persistence: Breaks clown in three to ten days.
Forms: Powder, wettable powder, liquid.
Toxicity: The effect on mammals is undetermined. Chronic exposure may cause Parkinson's.
It is toxic to birds, fish, and beneficials.
Safety: Wear a mask and gloves; cover exposed
skin and hair. Avoid skin contact.

Quassia
Ingredients: Quassia is made from a subtropical South Am erican tree, Quassia amara, and the
tree-of-heaven, Ailanthus altissima.
Controls: Soft-bodied insects including aphids,
leafminers, and some caterpillars.
Mixing: Available in the form of bark, wood
chips, and shavings. Soak 6 ounces ( 18 cl) of
chips per gallon (0.9 L) of water for 24 hours.

Ryania
Ingredients: This contact-alkaloid stomach poison is made from stems and roots of the tropical
shrub, Ryania speciosa.
Controls: Toxic to aphids, thrips, European corn
borers, hemp borers, flea beetles, lear rollers, and
many caterpillars. Once pests consume ryania,
they stop feeding immediately and die within 24
hours.
Caution: Somewhat toxic to beneficials and
mammals!
Mixing: Follow directions on package.
Application: Follow directions on package.

Sabadilla
Ingredients: This alkaloid pesticide is made
from the seeds of a tropical lily, Schoenocaulon
officinale, native to Central and South America,
and a European hellebore, Veratrum album.
Controls: A contact and stomach poison, this
centuri es-old poison controls aphids, beetles,
cabbage loopers, chinch bugs, grasshoppers, and
squash bugs.
Caution: Very toxic to honeybees and moderately toxic to mammals!
Mixing: Follow directions on package.
Application: Most potent when applied at 7580"F. Follow directions on package.
Persistence: Two or three days.
Forms: Powder, liquid.
Toxicity: Somewhat toxic to mammals, toxic to
honeybees.
Safety: Wear a mask, gloves, and safety glasses,
and cover exposed skin and hair. Avoid skin, eye,
ear, and nose contact. Irritates eyes and nose.

Seaweed
Ingredients: Numerous elements including
nutrients, bacteria, and hormones.
Controls: Suspended particles in seaweed
impair, and even kill, insects and spider mites by
causing lesions. The particles cut and penetrate
the soft-bodied pest insects and mites causing
their body fluids to leak out.
Mixing: Dilute as per instructions for soil application.
Application: Spray on foliage, especially under
leaves where mites live.
Persistence: Up to two weeks when spreadersticker is used.
Forms: Powder and liquid.
Toxicity: Not toxic to mammals, birds, and fish.
Non-selective, kill s beneficials.
Safety: Wear a masl< and gloves.

Soap, insecticidal
Ingredients: Mild contact insecticides made

from fatty acids of animals and
plants. A variety of soaps are available in potassium-salt based liquid
concentrates. Soft soaps such as
Ivory liquid dish soap, Castille soap,
and Murphy's Oil soap are
biodegradable and kill insects in a
similar manner to commercial
insecticidal soaps, but they are not
as potent or effective.
Controls: Controls soft-bodied
insects such as aphids and mealy
bugs, spider mites, thrips, and
whiteflies by penetrating and clogging body membranes.
Caution: Do not use detergent soaps because
they may be caustic.
Mixing: Add a few capfuls of soap to a quart of
water to make a spray. Ivory or Castille soap can
also be used as a spreader-sticl<er to mix with
other sprays. The soaps help the spray stick to
the foliage better.
Application: Spray at the first appearance of
insect pests. Follow directions on commercial
preparations. Spray homemade mixes every four
to five days.
Persistence: Soft soaps will last only for about
a day before dissipating.
Forms: Liquid.
Toxic.ity: These soaps are safe for bees, animals,
and humans.
Safety: Wear a mask and gloves.

Sulfur
Ingredients: Sulfur. Mixed with lime, sulfur is
more toxic to insects but more phytotoxic to
plants.
Controls: Centuries-old fungicide is effective
against rusts and powdery mildew.
Caution: Do not apply in temperatures above 90°F (32°C) and less
than 50 percent humidity. It will
b'urn foliage.
Mixing: Follow directions on package.
Application: Apply in light concentration. It is phytotoxic during
hot, 90"F, arid weather.
Persistence: It stays on foliage
until washed off.
Forms: Powder.

Application: Smear Tanglefoot rM around the
edges of pots, base of stems, and at the end of
drying lines to form an impenetrable barrier-trap
against mites and insects. This simple precaution
helps keep mites isolated. However, resourceful
spider mites can spin a web above the barrier.

Water
Ingredients: A cold jet of water- preferably with
a pH between 6 and 7- blasts insects, spider
mites, and their eggs off leaves and often kills

them. Hot water vapor and steam also work as a
sterilant.
Controls: A cold jet of water is an excellent first
wave of attack against spider mites, aphids, and
other sucking insects. Steam controls spider
mites, insects, and diseases on pots, growing
medium, and other grow-room surfaces.
Caution: Avoid spraying fully formed buds with
water. Standing water in or on buds promotes
gray mold. Do not apply hot steam to foliage.
Mixing: None.
Application: Spray leaf undersides with a jet of
cold water to knock off sucking spider mites and
aphids. Apply water as a mist or spray when
predatory mites are present. The extra humid
conditions impair the pest mite lifecycl es and
promote predatory mite health. Rent a wallpaper
steamer. Get it cooking, and direct a jet of steam
at all grow-room cracks and surfaces.
Persistence: None.
Forms: Liquid, steam vapor.
Toxicity: Not toxic to mammals, fish, and bene·
ficials.
Safety: Do not spray strong jet of water in eyes,
up nose, or into other body orifices.

Biological Controls
Predators and Parasites
Predator and parasite availability and supply
have changed substantiaffy over the last 10 years.
Today, many more predators and parasites are
available to home growers than ever before.
Shipping, care, cost, and application of each pred·
ator or parasite is very specific and should be pro·
vided in detail by the supplier. Make sure the
supplier answers the following questions:
1) Latin name of the predator so there is no

confusion as to identity.
2) Specific pests attacked.
3) Life cycl e.
II) Preferred climate including temperature ;md
humidity range.
5) Application rate and mode of application.
For more information about predators check
out the following web pages:

By definition, a predator must eat more than
one victim before adulthood. Predators, such as
ladybugs (ladybird beetles) and praying mantises,
have chewing mouthparts. Other predators, such
as lacewing larvae, have piercing-sucking mouth·

parts. Chewing predators eat their prey whole.
The piercing, sucking-type, suck the fluids from
their prey's body.
Parasites consume a single individual host
before adulthood. Adult parasitoids typically
place a single egg into many hosts. The egg
hatches into larvae that eat the host insect from
the inside out. They save the vital organs for
dessert! Most often, the larvae pupate inside the
host's body and emerge as adults.
Parasites, unlike predators, hunt until the prey is
almost eliminated. Predators choose to be sur·
rounded by prey. When prey population starts to
diminish a little, predators move on to lind a nice,
fat infestation. They never truly eradicate the
pests. This is why predators worl< best for preven·
tative control, but are slow to stop an infestation.
The rate at which the predators and parasites
keep the infestation in check is directly propor·
tionate to the amount of predators. The more
predators and parasites, the sooner they will get
infestations into check. Predators and parasites
outbreed their victims, reproducing faster than
pests are able to keep up with.
One of the best places in the country to buy
predatory and parasitoid insects is from Nature's
Control, Medford, Oregon. Check out their very
informative web site at www.naturescontrol.coro.
This supplier gives advice and supplies specific
care and release instructions. Nature's Control
has a good predator and parasite supply and can
ship year round. Predators and parasites are
shipped special delivery and may arrive alter the
daily-mail delivery. Make sure to pick them up as
soon as they arrive. Do not let predators sit inside
a mailbox in the hot sun. It could easily reach
120°F (49°C) or more!
When predators and parasites are introduced
into a garden, special precautions must be taken
to ensure their well-being. Stop spraying all-toxic
chemicals at least two weel<s before introducing
the predators. Pyrethrum and insecticidal soaps
can be applied up to a lew days before, providing
any residue is washed off with fresh water. Do
not spray after releasing predators and parasites.
Predators and parasites survive best in gardens
that are not sterilized between crops. Gardens
with perpetual harvests are ideal for predators.
Most of the predators and parasites that do well
in an indoor HID garden cannot fly. Insects that
can fly often head straight for the lamp. Ladybu gs
are the best example. If 500 ladybugs are
released on Monday, by Friday, only a few die·

I

hards will be left. The rest will have popped off
the lamp. If using flying predators or parasitoids,
release when it is dark. They will live longer.
Predators are most often very small and must
be introduced to each plant separately.
Introducing predators to a garden and plants
takes a little time and patience. Predators also
have very specific climatic requirements. Pay
attention to the predators' needs and maintain
them for best results.

Spider Mites and Insects
Here is one of the best web sites I have found
that describes insects. They have excellent photos
of all pests and predators that attack marijuana:

Spider mites cause stippling, small spots, on the top
of leaves.

Spider Mites
Identify: The spider mite is the most common
pest found on indoor plants and causes the most
problems. Spider mites have eight legs and are
classified as spiders rather than insects, which
have six legs. Find microscopic spider mites on
leaf undersides sucking away life-giving fluids. To
an untrained naked eye, they are hard to spot.
Spider mites appear as tiny specks on leaf undersides; however, their telltale signs of feedingyellowish-white spots, stippling-on the tops of
leaves are easy to see. Careful inspection reveals
tiny spider webs-easily seen when misted with
water- on sterns and under leaves as infestations
progress. A magnifying glass or low-power
microscope (1 0-30X) helps to identify the yellowwhite, two-spotted brown or red mites and their
translucent eggs. Indoors, the most common is
the two-spotted spider mite. After a single mat-

ing, females are fertilized for life and reproduce
about 75 percent female and 25 percent male
eggs. Females lay about 100 eggs.
Damage: Mites suck life-giving sap from plants,
causing overall vigor loss and stunting. Leaves
are pocked with sucl<·hole marks and yellow
from fa ilure to produce chlorophyll. They lose
partial to full function, and leaves turn yellow and
drop. Once a plant is overrun with spider mites,
the infestation progresses rapidly. Severe cases
cause plant death.
Controls: Cleanliness! This is the most important first step to spider mite control. l<eep the
grow room and tools spotless and disinfected.
Mother plants often have spider mites. Spray
mothers regularly with miticides, including once
three days before taking cuttings. Once mite
infestations get out of control and miticides work
poorly, the entire grow room will have to be
cleaned out and disinfected with a pesticide and
5 percent bleach solution. Steam disinfection is
also possible but too diff'icult in most situations.
Cultural and physical control: Spider mites
thrive in a dry, 70-80°F (21·27° C) climate, and
reproduce every five days in temperatures above
80°F (27° C). Create a hostile environment by
lowering the temperature to 60°F (16°C) and
spray foliage, especially under leaves, with a jet of
cold water. Spraying literally blasts them off the
leaves as well as increases humidity. Their reproductive cycle will be slowed, and you will have a
chance to kill them before they do much damage. Manual removal works for small populations. Smash all mites in sight between the
thumb and index finger, or wash leaves individu-

ally in between two sponges. Avoid infecting
other plants with contaminated hands or
sponges.
Remove leaves with more than 50 percent
damage and throw away, making sure insects
and eggs do not reenter the garden. If mites
have attacked only one or two plants, isolate the
infected plants and treat them separately. Tal<e
care when removing foliage not to spread mites
to other plants. Severely damaged plants should
be carefully removed from the garden and
destroyed.
Smear a layer of Tanglefoof'" around the lips of
containers and at the base of stems to create barriers spider mites cannot cross. This will help isolate them to specific plants. Note: smear a layer
of Tanglefoot"' at each end of drying lines when
hanging buds to contain spider mites. Once
foliage is dead, mites try to migrate down drying
lines to find live foliage with fresh, flowing sap.
Biological: Neoseiu/us (Amblyseius) califomicus and Mesoseiulus (phytoseiulus) longipes, are
the two most common and effective predators.
Phytoseiulus persimilis, Neoseiulus (Amblyseius)

Progressive Control Measures
for Spider Mites
Cleanliness • Clean room daily, disinfect tools,
do not introduce new pests into the
garden on clothes, no animal visits, etc.
Create hostile environment • Humidity,
temperature, water spray.
Create barriers • Smear Tanglefoot"' around
pot lips, stems, drying lines.
Dip cuttings and vegetative plants • Dip small
plants in pyrethrum, horl'icultural oil,
neem oil.
Remove damaged foliage • Remove foliage
more than 50 percent damaged.

-

Introduce predatory mites • Release predators
before infestations grow out of hand.
'

Spray • Apply pyrethrum or neem oil; use strong
miticides only if necessary. Rotate sprays
so mites do not develop immunity.

fallacius, Galendromus (Metaseiulus) occidentalis,
and Galendromus (Typh/odromus) pyri predators
are also available commercially.
When properly applied and reared, predatory spider mites work very well. There are many things to
consider when using the predators. First, predators
can eat only a limited number of mites a day; the
average predator can eat 20 eggs or 5 adults daily.
As soon as the predators' source of food is gone,
some mites die of starvation while others survive
on other insects or pollen. Check with suppliers for
release instructions of specific species. A general
dosage of 20 predators per plant is a good place to
start. Predatory mites have a diHicult time traveling
from plant to plant, so setting them out on each
plant is necessary. Temperature and humidity levels must be at the proper levels to give the predators the best possible chance to thrive. When spider mites have infested a garden, the predatory
mites cannot eat them fast enough to solve the
problem. Predatory mites work best when there
are only a few spider mites. Introduce predators as
soon as spider mites are seen on vegetative
growth, and release them every month thereafter.
This gives predators a chance to keep up with
mites. Before releasing predators, rinse all plants
thoroughly to ensure all toxic-spray residues from
insecticides and fungicides are gone.
The fungus, Nirsutella thompsonii, trade name
Mycaruo, kills spider mites.
Sprays: Homemade sprays often lack the
strength to kill infestations but work as a deterrent
by repelling mites. Popular homemade sprays
include Dr. Bonner's Soap, garlic, hot pepper, citrus
oil, and liquid seaweed combinations. If th ese
sprays do not deter spider mites after four to five
applications, switch to a stronger spray: neem oil,
pyrethrum, horticultural oil, or nicotine sulfate, cinnamaldehyde.
Insecticidal soap does a fair job of controlling
mites. Usually two or three applications at five to
ten day intervals will do the trick.
Horticultural oil smothers eggs and can be mixed
with pyrethrum and homemade sprays to improve
extermination.
Pyrethrum (aerosol) is the best natural miticide!
Apply two to three applications at five to ten day
intervals. Pyrethrum is the best control for spider
mites. Spider mites should be gone after two or
three applications at five to ten day intervals, providing sanitary preventative conditi ons are maintained. Eggs hatch in five to ten days. The second
spraying will kill the newly hatched eggs and the

remammg adults. The third and subsequent
applications will kill any new spider mites, but
mites soon develop a resistance to synthetic
pyrethrum.
Neem oil works great!
Heavy-duty chemical miticides are available but
are not recommended on plants that will be consumed by humans. If using any chemical miticide, be sure it is a contact poison and not systemic. Use StirrupMOt>, described below, to
improve
the
spider
mite kill
rate.
Cinnamaldehyde extracted from Cinnamonum
zeylanicum kills mites. The synthetic hormonesold under the brand name StirrupMO\l-attracts
spider mites, and is used very successfully to
enhance miticides.

Ants farm aphids. They move aphids to uninfected

p/cmts.

Aphids
Identify: Aphids, also called plant lice, are
about the size of a pinhead. They are easy to
spot with the naked eye, but use a 1OX magnifying glass for positive identification. Aphids are
found in all climates. Normally grayish to blacl<,
aphids can be green to pink- in any color, aphids
attack plants. Most aphids have no wings, but
those that do have wings are about four times
the size of their bodies. Aphids give birth to
mainly live female larvae, without mating, and
can pump out 3 to 100 hungry larvae every day.
Each female reproduces between 40 and 100 offspring that start reproducing soon after birth.
Aphids are most common indoors when they are
plentiful outdoors. Install yellow sticky traps near
base of several plants and near the tops of other
plants to monitor invasions of winged aphids,
often the first to enter the garden. As they feed,
aphids exude sticky honeydew that attracts ants
that feed on it. Ants like honeydew so much that
they take the aphids hostage and make them
produce honeydew. Look for columns of ants
marching around plants, and you will find aphids.
Damage: Aphids suck the life-giving sap from
foliage causing leaves to wilt and yellow. When

infestation mounts, you may notice sticky honeydew excreted by aphids. They prefer to attack
weak, stressed plants. Some species prefer succulent, new growth, and other aphids like older
foliage or even flower buds. Look for them under
leaves, huddled around branch nodes, and growing tips. This pest transports (vectors) bacterium,
fungi, and viruses. Aphids vector more viruses
than any other source. Destructive sooty mold
also grows on honeydew. Any aphid control
must also control ants, if they are present.
Controls: Manually remove small numbers.
Spot-spray small infestations, and control ants.
Introduce predators if problem is persistent.
Cultural and physical control: Manual removal
is easy and works well to kill them. When affixed
to foliage- sucking out fluid- aphids are unable to
move and easy to crush with fingers or sponges
clipped in an insecticidal solution.
Biological: Lacewings, Chrysoperla species, are
the most effective and available predators for
aphids. Release one to 20 lacewings per plant,
depending on infestation level, as soon as aphids
appear. Repeat every month. Eggs take a few
days to hatch into larvae that exterminate aphids.
Gall-midge, Aphidoletes aphidimyz, is available
under the trade name Aphidend; parasitic wasp,
Aphidius matricaria, is available commercially as
Aphid par.
Ladybugs also work well to exterminate aphids.
Adults are easily obtained at many retail nurseries during the summer months. The only drawbad< to ladybugs is their attraction to the HID
lamp- release about 50 ladybugs per plant, at
least half of them will fly directly into the HID, hit
the hot bulb, and buzz to their death. Within one
or two weeks all the ladybugs will fall victim to
the lamp, requiring frequent replenishment.
Vertici/lium leconii (fungus)- available under
the trade name of Vertalec®-is very aphid specific and effective.
Control ants by mixing borax hand soap or
borax powder with powdered sugar. Ants eat the
sweet mix and borax kills them. They excrete
sweet borax mix in the nest where other ants eat
the feces and die.
Sprays: Homemade and insecticidal soap
sprays are very effective. Apply two or three
times at five to ten day intervals. Pyrethrum
(aerosol) applied two to three times at live to ten
day intervals.

Bees and Wasps
Identify: Bees and wasps
that sting are usually from a
half inch (1.5 em) to more
than an inch (3 em) long.
Most have yellow stripes
around their bodies and others have none. They are
especially attracted to indoor
gardens when weather cools
outdoors- they move right in.

Controls: Occasionally a
problem indoors, bees and wasps are most efficiently controlled with sprays.
Cultural and physical control: They enter grow
rooms through vents and cracks, attracted by the
growing plants, a valuable commodity in the middle of a cold winterl Screen all entrances to the

Biological: Unnecessary.
Sprays: Pyrethrum is recommended. Stuff
small nests into a wide-mouthed jar-do it at
night when the wasps are quiet-and place the jar
in a freezer for a few hours. Use Sevin, Carbaryl,
only if there is a problem with a wasp nest.

their entry hole and dead growth on either side
of the entry hole along the main stem, often discolored and accompanied by sawdust. Borers are
more common outdoors than indoors.
Damage: Tunnels inside the stem and roots;
curtails fluid flow, and causes plant parts to wilt.
If borer damages the main stem severely, fluid
flow to the entire plant could stop, causing death.
Controls: Seldom a problem indoors. Borers
often cause so much damage on a particular
stem that it has to be removed and destroyed.
Cultural and physical control: Handpick all
beetle grubs.
Biological: Several mixes of beneficial nematodes con trol these borers in soil.
Sprays: Bacilltls popilliae is specifi c to beetles
or rotenone individually injected into stems.

Caterpillars and Loopers

two sets of feet at either end of the body.
Loopers place their front feet fo rward, arch their
body upward in the middle, and pull their rear
sets of legs forward. Some have stripes, spots,
and other designs that provide camou flage.
Seldom a problem indoors, ca terpillars and loopers are in a life stage- between a larva and a flying moth or butterfly- and are most common
when prevalent outdoors. One way to check for
caterpillars and loopers is to spray one plant with
pyrethrum aerosol spray and shake the plant
afterward. The spray has a quick knockout effect,
and most caterpillars will fall from the plant.
Damage: These munching critters chew and eat
pieces of foliage and leave telltale bites in leaves.
Some caterpillars will roll themselves inside
leaves. An infestation of caterpillars or leafhoppers will damage foliage and slow growth, eventually defoliating, stunting, and killin g a plant.
Cultural and physical control: Manually remove.
Biological: Trichogrommo wasps, spined soldier bug (Podisus moculiventris Podibug®).
Sprays: Homemade spray/repellent, hot pepper and garlic. Bt, pyrethrum, and rotenone

are hung to dry; inspect below the hung buds to
find the poop droppings.
Identify: From half inch to four inches (1 .5· 10
em), caterpillars and loopers are cylindrical with
feet, often green, bllt can be virtually any color
from white to black. Caterpillars have sets of feet
the entire length of the body, while loopers have

inch (3 mm) long, wedge-shaped insects that are
usually green, white, or yellow. Many species have
minute stripes on wings and bodies. Their wings
peak like roof rafters when not in use. Leafhoppers
suck plant sap for food and exude sticky honeydew
as a by-product. Spittlebug and leafhopper larvae
wrap themselves in foliage and envelop themselves in a saliva-like liquid, plant sap.
Damage: Stippling (spotting) similar to that
caused by spider mites and thrips on foliage.
Leaves and plant lose vigor, and in severe cases
death could result.
Cultural and physical Control: Cleanliness!
Black light traps are attractive to potato beetles.
. Biological: The fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, is commercially available under the trade
name Metaquino®.
Sprays: Pyrethrum, rotenone, sabadilla.

Leaf Miner
Identify: Adult leaf miner fli es lay eggs that
hatch into one-eighth-inch (0.25 mm) long
(green or black) maggots. You seldom see the
maggots before you see the leaf damage they

create when they tunnel through leaf tissue. Leaf
miners are more common in greenhouses and
outdoors than indoors.
Damage: The tiny maggots burrow between
leaf surfaces, leaving a telltale whitish-tunnel outline: The damage usually occurs on or in young
supple growth. It is seldom fata l, unless left
unchecked. Damage causes plant growth to
slow, and if left unchecked, flowering is prolonged and buds are small. In rare cases the
damage is fatal. Wound damage encourages disease.
Controls: These pests cause little problem to
indoor crops. The most efficient and effective
control is to remove and dispose of damaged
foliage, which includes the rogue maggot, or to
use the cultural and physical control listed below.
Cultural and physical control: Smash the little
maggot trapped within the leaf with your lingers.
If the infestation is severe, smash all larvae possible iJnd remove severely infested leaves.
Compost or burn infested leaves. Install yellow
sticky traps to capture adults.
Biological: Branchid Wasp (Dacnusa sibirica),
chalcid wasp (Diglyphus isaea), parasitic wasp
(Opius pallipes).
Sprays: Repel with neem oil and pyrethrum
sprays. Maggots are protected within tunnels,
and sprays are often ineffective. Hemp Diseases
and Pests suggests to water plants with a 0.5 percent solution of neem. This solution works fast
and stays on plants for four weeks after application.

Fungus Gnat
Identify: Maggots, larvae, grow to 4-5 mm long
and have translucent bodies with black heads.
Winged adult gnats are gray to black, 2-4 mm
long, with long legs. Look for them around the
base of plants in soil and soilless gardens. They
love the moist, dank environments in rockwool
and the environment created in NFT-type hydroponic gardens. Adult fe males lay about 200 eggs
every week to ten days.
Damage: Infests growing medium and roots
near the surface. They eat fine root hairs and scar
larger roots, causing plants to lose vigor and
foliage to pale. Root wounds invite wilt fungi like
Fusarium or Pythium especially if plants are nutrient-stressed and growing in soggy conditions.
Maggots prefer to consume dead or decaying,
soggy plant material; they also eat green algae

Leaf miner larvae burrow in the leaf. They cause
few problems indoors and are most common outdoors in spring and early summer. Kill them by
smashing them between your fingers.

Biological: The aforementioned Bt-i works
best. Alternatives include the predatory soil mite
(Hypoaspis (Geolaelapumites) and the nematode (Steinemema felliae).
Sprays: Apply neem or insecticidal soap as a
soil-drench.

Mealybugs and Scales
Mealybugs:
Identify: Somewhat common indoors, these
0.08·0.2 inch (2·7 mm) oblong, waxy-white
insects move very little, mature slowly, and live in
colonies that are usually located at stem joints.
Like aphids, mealybugs excrete sticky honeydew.
Scale affix rhemselves ro stems ond foliage. They
are a minor problem indoors and outdoors.

growing in soggy conditions. Adults and larvae
can get out of control quickly, especially in hydro·
ponic systems with very moist growing mediums.
The adult gnats stick to resinous buds like flypa·
per! The gnats are very difficult to clean from the
buds.
Controls: The easiest way to control these pests
is with VectobacOil, Gnatrol®, and Bactimosou, all
contain Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (81·
t). This strain of Bt controls the maggots; unfor·
tunately, it is available only in large one-gallon
(3.8 L) containers. Difficult to find at garden centers, check hydroponic stores.
Cultural and physical control: Do not overwater, and keep ambient humidity low. Do not let
growing medium remain soggy. Cover growing
medium so green algae won't grow. Yellow
sticky traps placed horizontally 1-2 inches (3·6
em) over growing medium catches adults.

Scales:
As uncommon indoors as mealybugs, scale
looks and acts similar to mealybugs but is usually more round than oblong. Scales may be white,
yellow, brown, gray, or blacl<. Their hard protective shell is 0.08·0.1 5 inch (2·4 rnm) across.
Mealybugs rarely or never move. Check for them
around stem joints where they live in colonies.
Scales sometimes excrete sticky honeydew.
Damage: These pests suck sap from plants
which causes growth to slow. They also exude
sticky honeydew as a by-product of their diet of
plant sap which encourages sooty mold and
draws ants that eat the honeydew.
Controls: These pests present little problem to
indoor growers. The easiest and most elficient
control is listed under Cultural and physical
below.
Cultural and physical control: Manual removal
is somewhat tedious but very effective. Wet a Q·
Tip in rubbing alcohol and wash scale away. A
small knife, fingernails, or tweezers may also be
necessary to scrape and pluck the tightly affixed
mealybugs and scales after they are Q-Tipped
with alcohol.
Biological: There are numerous species of
tT,Iealybugs and scales. Each has natural preda·
tors including species of ladybeetles (ladybugs)
and parasitic and predatory wasps. There are so
many species of each that it would be exhaustive
to list them here. For more specific information
see Hemp Diseases and Pests.
Sprays: Homemade sprays that contain rubbing
alcohol, nicotine, and soaps all kill these pests.
Insecticidal soap, pyrethrum, and neem oil are all
recommended.

Nematodes
Identify: Of the hundreds and thou sands of
species of microscopic nematodes- sometimes,
big ones are called eelworms- a few are destructive to plants. Most often nematodes attack roots
and are fou nd in the soil; however, a few nematodes attack stems and foliage. Root nematodes
can often be seen in and around roots with the
help of a 30X microscope. Often growers just
diagnose the damage caused by destructive
nematodes rather than actually seeing them.
Damage: Slow growth, leaf chlorosis, wilting
several hours during daylight hours from lack of
fluid fl ow- symptoms can be difficult to discern
from nitrogen deficiency. Root damage is often
severe by the time they are examined. Root knot
nematodes are some of the worst. They cause
roots to swell with galls. Other nematodes scrape
and cut roots, compounded by fungal attacks.
Roots turn soft and mushy.
Cultural and physical control: Cleanliness!
Use new, sterilized potting soil or soilless mix to
exclude nematodes entrance. Nematodes rarely
cause problems indoors in clean grow rooms.
Biological: French marigolds, Tagetes patu/a,
repels soil nematodes, fungus (Myrothecium verrucaria, trade name DeTera ESov)
Sprays: Neem used as a soil-drench.

Root Maggot
Identify: Both the seed corn maggot and the
cabbage maggot attack cannabis roots. The seed
corn maggot is 1.5 to 2 inches (5-6 em) long. The
seed corn maggot converts into a fly and is a bit
smaller than a common housefly. Cabbage maggots are 0.3 inch (1 em) long, and the adult fly is
bigger than a housefly. These pests winter over in
the soil and live in unclean soil. In the spring,
they emerge as adult flies and soon lay eggs in
the soil at· the base of young plnnt·s. The squirmy,
whitish larvae hatch several days later with a ravenous appetit·e.
Damage: Root maggots chew and burrow into
stems and roots. The seed corn maggot attacks
seeds and seedling roots. Cabbage maggots
attack roots, leaving hollowed out channels and
holes in larger roots. Both maggots destroy small
hair-like feeder roots. Wounds made by the root
maggots also foster soft rot and fungal diseases.
Cultural and physical control: Cleanliness!
Use fresh, new store-bought soil when planting in
containers. Cover seedlings with AgronetQu to

exclude flies, and plant late in the year to avoid
most adult flies. Place a collar 18-inch (45 ern) of
foa m rubber around the base of the plant to
exclude flies.
Biological: Control with parasitic nematodes,
Steinernema feltiae or Heterorhabditis bacteriophora.
Sprays: Kill root maggots with neern and horticultural oil used as a soil-drench.

Slugs and Snails
Identify: Slugs and snails are soft, slimy white,
dark, or yellow, and occasionally striped. They are
0.25-3 inches (1-9 em) long. Snails live in a circular shell, slugs do not. They hide by day and
feed at night. Slugs and snails leave a slimy, silvery trail of mucus in their wake. They lay translucent eggs that hatch in about a month. They
reproduce prolifically, and the young mollusks
oft,en eat relatively more than adults.
Damage: They make holes in leaves often with
a web-like appearance. They will eat almost any
vegetati on, roots included. These creatures winter over in warm, damp locations in most climates, Slugs and snails especially like tender
seedlings. They will migrate to adjacent gardens
in quest of food.
Cultural and physical control: A clean, dry
perimeter around the garden will make it difficult
for them to pass. Spotlight and handpick at· night.
A thin layer of lime, diatomaceous earth, or salty
beach sand two to six (6-15 ern) inches wide
around individual plants, beds, or the entire garden will present an impassable barrier. The lime
is not thick enough to alter the pH and will repel

or dissolve pests. To trap, attach short one inch
(3 em) feet on a wide board and leave it in the
garden. The pests will seek refuge under the
board. Pick up the board every day or two, and
shake the slugs off and step on them.
Poisonous baits usually have metaldahyde as a
base. Confine the bait to a slug hotel. Cut a 1 x
2-inch (3-6 em) slot in a covered plastic container to make a slug and snail hotel. Place slug and
snail bait inside the hotel. The hotel must keep
the bait dry and off the soil. In a slug hotel, none
of the poison bait touches the soil, and the bait is
inaccessible to children, pets, and birds. Place
slug and snail hotels in out of the way places.
Natural baits include a mix of jam and water and
beer. If using beer, it must be deep enough to
drown mollusks.
Biological: The predatory snail, Ruminia c/ecol/ato- available commercially- is yet another way
to combat plant-eating slugs and snails.
Sprays: Young slugs and snails are not attracted
to bait. Spray for young at night or early morning
with a 50 percent ammonia-water solution.

Thrips

Slugs and snails cause most damage to seedlings
outdoors. Look for slime trails and holes in leaves to
help identify the pests. ,

/.:
Thrips make light abrasions on leaf stsrfaces.

Identify: More common in greenhouses than
indoors. These tiny, winged, fast moving little critters are hard to see but not hard to spot. From
0.04-0.05 inch (1 -1.5 mm) long, thrips can be different colors, including whi te, gray, and dark colors, often with petite stripes. Check for them
under leaves by shaking parts of the plant. If
there are many thrips present, they choose to
jump and run rather than fly to safety. But often
you will see them as a herd of specks thundering
across foliage. Females make holes in soft plant
tissue where they deposit eggs that are virtually
invisible to the nalted eye. Winged thrips easily
migrate from infested plants to the entire garden.
Damage: Thrips scrape tissue from leaves and
buds, afterward suclting out the plant juices for
food. Stipples- whitish-yellowish specks- appear
on top of leaves; chlorophyll production diminishes and leaves become bri ttle. You will also see
black specks of thrip feces and little thrips. Many
times thrips feed inside flower buds or wrap-up
and distort leaves.
Cultural and physical control: Cleanliness!
Blue or pink sticky traps, misting plants with
water impairs travel. Manual removal works okay
if only a few thrips are present, but they are hard
to catch. Thrips can be very vexin g to control
once they get established.

Biological : Predatory mites (Amblyseius cucumeris and Amblyseius barkeri, Neoseiulus cucumeris, lphiseius degenerans, Neoseiulus barked, Euseius hibiset), parasitic wasps (Thripobis
semiluteus, Ceranisus menes, Goethecma shakespearei), pirate bugs (Orius species), fungus,
Verticillium lecani, is effective.
Sprays: Homemade sprays such as tobacconicotine base; commercial pyrethrum, synthetic
pyrethrum, insecticidal soap. Apply two to four
times at five to ten day intervals.

Whiteflies
Identify: The easiest way to check for the little
buggers is to grab a limb and shake it. If there are
any whiteflies, they will fly from under leaves.
Whiteflies look like a small, white moth about
0.04-inch (1 mm) long. Adult whiteflies have
wings. They usually appear near the top of the
weakest plant first. They will move downward on
the plant or fly off to infest another plant. Eggs
are also found on leaf underside, where they are
connected with a small hook.
Damage: Whiteflies, like mites, may cause
white speckles, stipples, on the tops of leaves.
Loss of chlorophyll production and plant vigor
diminishes as infestation progresses.
Cultural and physical control: Mites are difficult to remove manually because they fly. Adults
are attracted to the color yellow. To build a
whitefly trap similar to flypaper, cover a bright,
yellow object with a sticky substance like
Tanglefoot'M. Place the traps on the tops of the
pots among the plants. Traps work very well.
When they are full of insects, toss them out.
Biological: The wasp, Encarisa formosa, is the
most effective whitefly parasite. The small wasps
only attack whiteflies, they do not sting people!
All toxic sprays must be washed completely off
before introducing parasites and predators. Since
the Encarsia formosa is a parasite, about 0. 125
inch (3 mm) long, smaller than the whitefly, it
takes them much longer to control or even keep
the whi tefly population in check. The parasitic
wasp lays an egg in the whitefly larva that later
hatches and eats the larva alive, from the inside
out- death is slow. If you use them, set them out
at the rate of two or more parasites per plant as
soon as the first whi tefly is detected. Repeat
every two to four weeks throughout the life of the
plants.

Whiteflies can be seen in between yellowish aphids.
Dark spots are honeydew that has started to mold

The fungus Verticillium
lecanii AKA
Cephalosporium lecanii, trade name Mycatalrw, is
also very effective in whitefly control.
Sprays: Easily eradicated with natural sprays.
Before spraying, remove any leaves that have
been over 50 percent damaged and cure with
heat or burn infested foliage. Homemade sprays
applied at five to ten day intervals work well.
Insecticidal soap applied at five to ten day intervals. Pyrethrum (aerosol) applied at five to ten
day intervals.

Fungi and Diseases
Fungi are very primitive plants and do not produce chlorophyll, the substance that gives higher
plants their green color. Fungi reproduce by
spreading tiny microscopic spores rather than
seeds. Countless fun gal spores are present in the
air at all times. When these microscopic-airborne
spores find the proper conditions, they will settle,
tal<e hold, and start growing. Some fungi, such as
bud-rotting gray mold (Botrytis) are so prolific
that they can spread through an entire crop in a
matter of days! In fact, one grow room was located near a swamp and Botrytis spores were
omnipresent in the environment. Buds and
stems contracted gray mold quickly and were

often reduced to a wisp -of-powdery-foliage in
short order. The grower lost four consecutive
crops. Finally, the grower moved to greener pastures and had no trouble with mold. Unsterile,

Although there are many different types of fungi,
they are usually prevented with similar methods.

cracked basement wall, the paint is drawn into
the moist crack. Remove all mold from the walls
by washing it a with bleach solution before painting with fungus-resistant paint. Cleanliness and
climate control are the keys to preventing fungi.
Few clean, well ventilated grow rooms have
problems with fungi. In contrast, every dingy,
dank, ill-kept indoor garden I have seen had fungal problems and yielded a substandard harvest.
Install a vent fan(s) large enough to remove
moist air quickly and keep humidity at 50 percent
or less. A vent fan is the easiest and least expensive humidity control device available. C0 2 generators produce humidity-increasing water vapor
as a by-product. Dehumidifiers are relatively
inexpensive, readily available at discount stores,
and do a good job of keeping humidity under
control in enclosed grow rooms. Dehumidifiers
draw extra electricity, and the condensed water
must be removed daily. Wood, coal, and electric
heat all dry and dehumidify the air. Most air conditioners can be set to a specific humidity level. If
the grow room(s) have a central heating/ air-conditioning vent, the vent can be opened to control
temperature and lower humidity.

Control
Prevent fungus by controlling all the factors
contributing to its growth: remove hiding places,
keep room clean, lower humidity to 50 percent,
and keep the air well-circulated. If prevention
proves inadequate and fungi appear, advanced
control measures are necessary. Carefully
remove and destroy dead leaves. Wash your
hands after handling diseased foliage. If the
problem attacks one or a few plants, isolate and
treat them separately. Remember, fungi can
spread like wildfire if the conditions are right. If
they get a good start even after all preventive
measures are taken, do not hesitate to take
extreme control methods including spraying the
entire garden with the proper fungicide.

Gray Mold (Botrytis), a.k.a. Bud Mold
Identify: Gray mold is the most common fun gus that attacks indoor plants and flourishes in
moist temperate climates common to many grow
rooms. Botrytis damage is compounded by
humid (above 50 percent) climates. It starts
within the bud and is difficult to see at the
onset- grayish-whi tish to bluish-green in
color- Botrytis appears hair-lil<e and similar to
laundry lint in moist climates. As the disease progresses, the fo liage turns somewhat slimy.
Damage can also appear as dark, brownish spots
on buds in less humid environments. Dry to the
touch, Botrytis-affected area often crumbles if
rubbed. Gray mold attacks countless other crops,
and airborne spores are present virtually everywhere. While most commonly found attacking
dense and swelling fl ower buds, it also attacks
stems, leaves, and seeds, causes damping-off,
and decomposes dry, stored bud. It is also transmitted via seeds.
Damage: Watch for single leaves that mysteriously dry out on the buds. They could be the telltale signs of a Botrytis attack inside the bud.
Constant observation, especially during the last
two weeks before harvest, is necessary to l<eep
this disease out of the garden. Flower buds are
quickly reduced to slime in cool, humid conditions or un-smokable powder in warm, dry
rooms. Botrytis can destroy an entire crop in
seven to ten days if left unchecked. Stem damage- Botrytis starts on stems and not buds- is less
common indoors. First, stems turn yellow and
canl<erous growths develop. The damage causes
growth above the wound to wilt and can cause
stems to fold over. Transported by air, contaminated hands, and tools, gray mold spreads very
quickly indoors, infecting an entire grow room in
less than a week when conditions are right.

Botrytis. olso known as bud mold, artacks bot/1 buds
and stems of plants.

from the garden one/ destroyed.

'

Evaporoted sulfur in a grow room or greenhouse
stops Botrytis from contaminating plants.

Damping-off attacked this stem at the soil line, rot•
ling the buried end of the stem.

Control: Minimize Botrytis attack incidence
with low humidity (50 percent or less), ample air
circulation, and ventilation. Grow varieties that
do not produce heavy, tightly packed buds that
provide a perfect place for this fungus to flourish.
Cool (below 70°F [21 •q), moist climates with
humidity above 50 percent are perfect for rampant gray mold growth. Remove dead leaf
stems, petioles, from stalks when removing damaged leaves to avoid Botrytis outbreaks, which is

..

often harbored by dead, rotting foliage. Increase
ventilation and keep humidity below 60 percent,
and keep the grow room clean! Use fresh, sterile growing medium for each crop.
Cultural and physical control: As soon as
Botrytis symptoms appear, use alcohol-sterilized
pruners to remove Botrytis-infected buds at least
one inch (3 em) below the infected area. Some
growers amputate two to four inches (5-10 em)
below damage to ensure removal. Do not let the
bud or anything that touchs it contaminate other
buds and foliage. Remove from the garden and
destroy. Wash your hands and tools after removing. Increase temperature to SO"F (26"C) and
lower humidity to below 50 percent. Excessive
nitrogen and phosphorus levels make foliage tender, so Botrytis can get a foothold. Make sure pH
is around 6 to faci litate calcium uptake. Low light
levels also encourage weak growth and gray
mold attack. Avoid heavy crowding of plants and
l<eep the light levels bright. Botrytis needs UV
light to complete its life cycle; without UV light it
cannot live. Some varieties seldom fa ll victim to
gray mold. Many crosses are more resistant to
gray mold than pure indica varieties. Harvest
when resin glands are still translucent Once
glands turn amber, threat of gray mold increases
substantially.
Biological: Spray plants with Gliocladium roseum and Trichoderma species. Prevent dampingoff wi th a soil application of Glioc/adium and
Trichoderma species. Hemp Diseases and Pests
suggests to experiment with the yeasts Pi cilia
guilliermondii and Candido oleophila or the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae.
Sprays: Bordeaux mixture keeps early stages of
Botrytis in check as long as it is present on the
foliage. Preventive spraying is advised if in a
high-ri sk area, but spraying buds near harvesttime is not advised. Seeds are protected from
Botrytis wi th a coating of Caplan. Check with
your local nursery for product recommendations.

Damping-off
Identify: This fu ngal condition, sometimes
called Pythium wilt, is often found in soil and
growing mediums. It prevents newly sprouted
seeds from emerging, and attacks seedlings causing them to rot at l'he soil line, yellows foliage
and rots older plants at soil line. It occassionally
attacks rooting cuttings at the soil line, too. It is

caused by different fungal species, including
Botrytis, Pythium, and Fusarium. Once initiated,
damping-off is fatal. At the onset of damping-ol'f,
the stem looses girth at the soil line, weakens,
then grows darl<, and finally fluid circulation is
cut, killing the seedling or cutting.
Control: Damping-off is caused by a combination of the following: (1 ) Fungi are already present in an unsterile rooting medium; (2)
Overwatering and maintaining a soggy growing
medium; (3) Excessive humidity. The disease can
be avoided by controlling soil moisture.
Overwatering is the biggest cause of damping-off
and the key to prevention. Careful daily scrutiny
of soil will ensure the proper amount of moisture
is available to seeds or cuttings. Start seeds and
root cuttings in a fast-draining, sterile coarse
sand, rockwool, Oasis"', or Jiffy" ' cubes, which are
difficult to overwater. Do not place a humidity
tent over sprouted seedlings- a tent can lead to
excessive humidity and damping-ol'f. Cuttings
are less susceptible to damping-off and love a
humidity t·ent to promote rooting. l<eep germination temperatures between 70·85°F (21 ·29°C).
Damping-off is inhibited by bright light; grow
seedlings under the HID rather than fluorescent
bulbs. l<eep fertilization to a minimum during
the first couple weeks of growth. Germinate
seeds between clean, fresh paper towels and
move seeds to soil once sprouted. Do not plant
seeds too deeply, cover with soil the depth of the
seed. Use fresh, steril e growing medium and
clean pots to guard against harmful fungus in the
soil.
Biological: Apply Polygangronm>(Pythium oligandrum) granules to soil and seed. Bak Pak®
or lntercept!lll are applied to the soil and Deny(HJ
or Dagger®-forms of the bacterium Burkholderia
cepacia-are put on the seeds. Epic®, l<odiac®,
Quantum 4000Qll, Rhizo-PiuS(til, System 3<tu, and
Seranadeou also suppress many causes of damp·
ing-off.
.
Chemical: Dust the seeds with Captan<lll. Avoid
benomyl fungicide soil drench because it kills
beneficial organisms.

A small, white spot and the beginning of rot at the
soil line are the first visual signs of damping-off.

Lack of oxygen caused by overwatering impairs root
development along the stem and contributes to
damping-off.

Downy Mildew
Identify: Sometimes called false mildew,
downy mildew affects vegetative and flowering
plants. Young, succulent foliage is a favorite starting place. Powdery mildew develops in temperatures below 76°F (2s•q.

Powdery mildew, fuzzy white spots signify the disease

stages is difficult; the best solution is to remove
diseased plants and destroy them.

Foliar Spots and Fungi
Identify: l eaf and stem fun gi, including leaf

Foliar spots started on this leaf afler it became
severely nitrogen-deficient.

It appears as whitish-yellow spots on top of
leaves creating pale patches. Grayish mycelium
spawn is on leaf undersides, opposite the pale
patches. Downy mildew can spread very quickly,
causing a lack- of vigor and slow growth; leaves
yellow, die back, and drop. The disease is in the
plant system and grows outward. It is often fatal,
spreads quickly, and can wipeout a crop. Avoid
promoting this disease by not crowding plants.
Keep temperatures above 76°F (26°C) and the
humidity below 50 percent.
Control: Cleanliness! Use sterile growing
medium. Remove and destroy affected plants,
not just foliage.
Biological: Apply Serenade® (Bacillus subtilis).
Bordeaux mixture is also somewhat effective.

Blight
Identify: Blight is a general term that describes
many plant diseases which are caused by fungus,
most often a few weeks before harvest. Signs of
blight include dark, blotchy spots on foliage, slow
growth, sudden yellowing, wilting, and plant
death. Most blights spread quickly through large
areas of plants.
Control: Cleanliness! Use fresh, sterile growing
medium. Avoid excess nitrogen fertilization.
Avoid blights by keeping plants healthy wi th the
proper nutrient balance and good drainage to
prevent nutrient buildup.
Biological: Use Serenade® (Bacillus subtilis)
against Brown Blight. Use Binab®, Bio·Fungus®,
RootShieldQ!),
SupresivitOi),
Trichopel®,
(Trichoderma harzionum) or SoiiGuard ®
(Trichoderma virens). Use a Bordeaux mixture to
stop fungal blights. Stopping blights in advanced

spot, attack foliage. Brown, gray, black, or yellow
to whi te spots or blotches develop on leaves and
sterns. l eaves and sterns discolor and develop
spots that impair plant fluid flow and other life
processes. Spots expand over leaves causing
them to yellow and drop. Growth is slowed, har·
vest prolonged, and in severe cases, death results.
l eaf spot is the symptomatic name given to many
diseases. These diseases may be caused by bac·
teria, fungus, and nematodes. Spots or lesions
caused by fungi often develop different colors as
fruiting bodies grow. l eaf spots are often caused
by cold water that was sprayed on plants under a
hot HID. Temperature stress causes the spots
that often develop into a disease.
Control: Cleanliness! Use fresh, sterile growing
medium with each crop. Move HIDs away from
the garden canopy about 30 minutes before
spraying so plants won't be too hot. Do not spray
within four hours of turning the lights off as
excess moisture sits on the fol iage and fosters
fungal growth. Do not wet foliage when water·
ing, avoid overwatering., and lower grow room
humidity to 50 percent or less. Check the humid·
ity both day and night. Employ dry heat to raise
the nighttime temperature to 5· 10°F (3·6°C)
below the daytime levels, and keep humidity
more constant. Allow adequate spacing between
plants to provide air circulation. Remove darnaged foliage. Avoid excessive nitrogen applica·
tion.
Biological: Bordeaux mixture may help keep
leaf spots in check, but it is often phytotoxic when
applied regularly indoors.
Sprays: Bordeaux mixture.

Fusarium Wilt
. Identify: Fusarium wilt is most common in
grow room s and greenhouses.
warm
Recirculating nutrient solutions above 75°F
(24°C) creates perfect conditions for fusarium.
The water and nutrient solution carries this disease with it when contaminated.. Fusarium starts
as small spots on older, lower leaves. lnterveinal
leaf chlorosis appears swi ftly. l eaf tips may curl
before wilting and suddenly drying to a crisp.
Portions of the plant or the entire plant will wil t.
The entire process happens so fast that yellow,

dead leaves dangle from branches. This disease
starts in the plant's xylem, the base of the fluid
transport system. Plants wilt when fungi plug the
fluid flow in plant tissue. Cut one of the main
stems in two, and look for the telltale reddishbrown color.
Control: Cleanliness! Use fresh, clean growing
medium. Avoid nitrogen over-fertilization.
Preventive action is necessary. Keep nutrient
solution below 75°F (24°C). Hydrogen peroxide
infusions will also arrest fusarium. Always
remove infested plants and destroy.
Biological:
Mycostop®
(Streptomyces
griseoviridis), or Deny~ll, or Dagger 111
(Burkholderia cepacia) and Trichoderma.
Sprays: Treat seeds with chemical fung icides to
eradicate the seed-borne infection. Chemical
fung icides are not effective on foliage.

Green Algae
Identify: Slimy green algae need nutrients,
light, and a moist surface on which to grow.
These algae are found growing on moist rockwool and other growing mediums exposed to
light. They cause little damage but attract fungus
gnats and other critters that damage roots. Once
roots have lesions and abrasions, diseases enter
easily.
Control: Cover the moist ro ckwool and growing
mediums to exclude light. Run an algaecide in
the nutri ent solution or water with an algaecide.

ease has been inside the plant a week or more.
Spots progress to a fine, pale, gray-white powdery coating on growing shoots, leaves, and
stems. Powdery mildew is not always limited to
the upper surface of foliage. Growth slows,
leaves yellow, and plants die as the disease
advances. Occasionally fatal indoors, this disease
is at its worst when roots dry out and foliage is
moist. Plants are infected for weeks before they
show the first symptoms.
Control: Cleanliness! Prevent this mildew by
avoiding cool, damp, humid, dim grow room conditions, as well as fluctuating temperatures and
humidity. Low light levels and stale air affect this
disease. Increase air circulation and ventilation,
and make sure light intensity is high. Space containers far enough apart so air freely flows
between plants. Allow foliage to dry before turning off lights. Remove and destroy fol iage more
than 50 percent infected. Avoid excess nitrogen.
Copper and sulfur-lime sprays are a good prophylactic.
Biological Control: Apply SerenadeQI) (Bacillus
subtilis) or spray with a saturation mix of baking
soda and water.
Sprays: Bordeaux mixture may keep this mold
in check. A saturation of baking soda spray dries
to a fine powder on the leaf; the baking soda
changes the surface pH of the leaf to 7, and powdery mildew cannot grow.

Root Rot
Powdery Mildew
Identify: First indication of infection is small
spots on the tops of leaves. At this point the dis-

Fusarium wilt causes the center of the stem to tum
reddish-brown in color.

Identify: Root rot fungi cause roots to turn from
a healthy white to light brown. As the rot progresses, roots turn darker and darl<er brown. Leaf
chlorosis is followed by wilting of the older leaves
on the entire plant, and its growth slows. When
severe, rot progresses up to the base of the plant
stock, turning it dark. Root rot is most common
when roots are deprived of oxygen and stand in
un-aerated water. Soil pests that cut, suck, and
chew roots create openings for rotting diseases
to enter. Inspect roots with a 1OX magnifying
glass for signs of pest damage.
Control: Cleanliness! Use fresh, sterile growing
medium. Make sure calcium levels are adequate,
and do not overfertilize with nitrogen. Keep pi-t
above 6.5 in soil and about 6.0 in hydroponic
mediums to lower disease occurrence. Control
any insects, fungi, bacteria, etc., that eat roots.

Sooty Mold
Identify: Black sooty mold is a surface fungus
that grows on sticky honeydew excreted by
aphids, mealybugs, scale, whiteflies, etc. Sooty
mold is only a problem on indoor plants wh en
honeydew is present. Sooty mold restricts plant
development, slows growth, and diminishes har·
vest.
Control: Remove insects that excrete honey·
dew. Once honeydew is controlled, mold dies.
Wash away honeydew and mold with a
biodegradable soapy solution. Rinse away soapy
water a few hours after applying.

Viruses
Identify: Viruses are still a mystery. They act like
living organisms in some instances and nonliving
chemicals in other cases. They must enter plants
via wounds. Once a virus takes over plant cells, it
is able to multiply. Viruses are spread by insects,
mites, plants, animals, and human vectors.
Aphids and whiteflies are the worst. Infected
tools also transport viruses from one plant to
another. Typical symptoms of viral infection are:
sickly growth, leaf and stem spots, yellowing, and
low yields. Viral diseases move into the plant's
fluid distribution system and destroy it, which
often cause leaf spots and mottling. A virus can
completely take over a plant in a few days. Once

Troubleshooting
This simple troubleshooting chart will solve 90
percent of the grow problems encountered when
growing cannabis. This chart started with an article in High Times magazine and borrowed from
the "Problem Identification Keys" presented in
Hemp Diseases and Pests: Management and
Biological Control, by J. M. McPartland, R. C.
Clarke, D. P. Watson .. Please see that book for
much, much more information. One word of caution- this troubleshooting chart assumes the grow
room is clean.
Clones are relatively easy to root. Success rate
depends on the proper combination of heat,
humidity, light, rooting hormone, and growing

medium aeration/moisture. The more precise the
combination, the faster and stronger roots grow.
The vegetative growth stage is when problems
begin to show. Often, these problems continue
through flowering. Remedy problems before they
progress. If allowed to persist through flowering,
yield will be substantially diminished.
Flowering is the last stage in life and only six to
ten weeks long. Problems must be solved within
the first two weeks (at the absolute latest, three
weeks) of flowering. or yields decrease in relation
to the severity of the problems.
Note: Keep growing area super clean to help
prevent problems. If you notice insects or fungus
on foliage, remove them and check them against
color photos and drawings in this book and the
troubleshooting chart below.

I

Warning: Do not use TOXIC SYSTEMIC CHEMICALS! Read the entire label on all sprays.
The toxic or active life of the spray is listed
on the label. Wait twice as long as the label
recommends, and thoroughly wash any
foliage before ingesting it. Toxic life is many
times longer indoors, because sunlight and
other natural forces are not able to break
down chemicals.
Sprays are beneficial if not overdone. Every
time a plant is sprayed, the stomata are
clogged and growth slow s. At 24-28 hours
after spraying, rinse leaves on both sides
with plain water until it drips from leaves.
Avoid sprays that leave a residual during the
w eeks before harvest. Spraying increases
chances of gray (bud) mold once dense
buds form.
Phytotoxicity is the injury to plants caused by
sprays. Symptoms include burned leaves,
slow growth, or sudden wilt. Spray a test
plant and wait a few days to see if spray is
phytotoxic. Water plants before spraying.
Phytotoxicity is diminished when more liquid is in foliage.
Temperatures above 68°F (20°C) make virtually all sprays, even organic ones, phytotoxic
and damaging to foliage.

A pump·t.ip sprayer with a spray wand allows you to
deliver spray under leaves where most pests live.

Intense light causes leaves to take in the
chemicals too quickly and will often cause
leaf damage.
Spray early in the day so ingredients are
absorbed and foliage dries. Spraying two
hours or less before lights-out can cause
foliar fungus when water sits on leaves too
long.
Do not mix two products. It could change
the characteristics of both.
Warm temperatures mean spraying twice as
often, because the bugs breed twice as fast.
Use a clean, accurate measuring cup or
spoon. Measure quantities carefully!

Curled leaves are the result of mixing and applying
sprays that are too strong. The natural spray applied
to this plant WC/S mixed double-strength.

Mix pesticides and fungicides just before
using them, and safely dispose of unused
spray. Mix fertilizer and use for several
weeks.
Mix w ettable powders and soluble crystals in
a little hot w ater to make sure they dissolve
before adding the balance of the tepid
water.

Powder fungicides are easiest to apply with an applicator that disperses the powder evenly an foliage.

Use chemical sprays with extreme care, if at
all, in enclosed areas; they are more concentrated indoors th an outdoors in the open air.
Use a facemask when spraying. especially if
using an aerosol fogger.
Spray entire plants, both sides of the leaves,
stems, soil, and pot. Be careful with new,
tender-growing shoots; th ey are easily
burned by harsh sprays.
A one quart (0.9-1.8 L) or two quart pumpup spray bottle with a removable nozzle
that is easy to clean is ideal. Keep a paper
clip handy to ream out clogged debris in
nozzle.

This grower is taking no
chances. He suited up
to avoid any contact
with sprays.

Hold foliage back so
you can spray under
the leaves where most
pests reside.

A 1-2 gallon (3.8-7.6 L) sprayer costs less
than $50 and w orks w ell for large gardens.
An application w and and nozzle attached to
a flexible hose makes spraying under leaves
where insects live easy. Plastic is recommended; it does not corrode or rust.
Electric foggers work w ell for large jobs. The
spray is metered out a nozzle under high
pressure, which creates a fine penetrating
fog.
Wash the sprayer and the nozzle thoroughly after each use. Using the same bottle for
fertil izers and insecticides is okay. Do not
mix insecticides and fungicid es together or
with anything else. Mixing chemicals could
cause a reaction that lessens their effectiveness.

Too strong a spray caused brown burn spots and
made this leaf curl downward.

Raise HID lamp out of the way so mist from
spray will not touch the bulb; temperature
stress, resulting from the relatively cold
water hitting the hot bulb, may cause it to
sha tter. This could not only scare the hell
out of you, it could burn eyes and skin. If
the bulb breaks, turn off the system immediately and unplug!

Resin glands generally break off near
the bottom of the
stalk and just under
the round head.

Introduction
Hashish is the connoisseur's smoke. Hashish,
also called hash, is the resin heads of glandular
trichomes that are collected, pressed together,
and shaped. The more resin on the input material, the better the hash. Here we will touch on
the basics of making hashish using safe extraction methods. I have omitted detailed information on chemical extraction methods using
butane, acetate, different alcohols, etc., because
of possible health risks from explosion, fire, and

fum es. Chemical
damage may result
from premature
use of the endproduct before all
solvents and residuals have been
extracted. You can
find much information on these
subjects at www.overgrow.com.
Resin can be collected by scraping it from your
hands after handling resinous plants or buds. It
can be scraped from tools, too. Resin can be collected by separating it from foliage and letting it
fall through a sieve. Or it can be separated from
foliage using cold water and sieves.

Before Making Hash

Make sure your plants are as clean as possible.
Any oil-based residues on leaves will show up in
the hash. For example, if extracting resin
with water, you can
see impurity residues
as a sheen of oil in
the water. During the
month before harvest, do not use any
harmful chemicals
that leave residues. I
prefer to use only
water-based organic
products' to avoid
potential health risks
to the consumer.
Flush plants with
water for seven to ten
days prior to harvest,

Pollen - In Europe and other parts
of the world, sieved resin powder is
called pollen. The term is used
because the two look similar, but
resin powder is not pollen. When you
hear somebody talking about
"pollen," you know they are referring
to resin powder.
fertilizers in the soil and foliage. This will
help ensure clean, sweet-tasting hash.
Freeze First - Collect more resin by making foliage and resin glands brittle. Cold,

Sieves
Introduction
The first time I saw sieved cannabis resin was
in 1983 at the Cannabis Castle in Holland.
Neville, owner of the Seed Bank, had a large
silkscreen stretched across a frame that was set
on top of a large desk with a glass top. We
would toss a handful or two of buds on the
screen and bounce them around a few seconds.
After two or three rounds of tossing and bouncing, a thin sheen of resin could be found on the
top of the glass below the silkscreen. 1 had never
smoked anything so potent in my life!
Re.sin heads are different sizes. With the help
of sreves, you can use the differences in resin
head sizes to separate them from other plant
matter. Typically, a minimum of two sieves are
used to make hash. The first one filters out the
lar~e plant matter and larger debris, letting the
resrn glands and small debris pass through to
the second sieve. The first sieve should have
135-150-micron pores. The second sieve allows
small resin glands to pass, while it holds back
large, mature resin glands. The pores on the second sieve should be from 50-60 microns. You
can find silkscreens at your local hobby and art
supply store. Printing supply stores also sell
framed screens.
To sieve, plants should be as dry as possible
and cold (about 41 °F [5°q) so resin glands
break off easily. Be careful not to force the plant
material through the sieve. Forcing will break
more resin glands and smear their contents on
the sieve and other plant material. The contents
of these ruptured glands cannot be recovered.
Normally, the largest mature resin glands fall
first. They are followed by less mature glands
and .debris including pistillate hairs and plant
debns. If you abuse sieving and force too much
through the sieve, the hash will be green and of
low quality. At best, sieving removes only half of
the THC-rich resin in cannabis.
Atmospheric relative humidity can slow the
sieving process to a halt because it causes the
pores of the sieve to clog. High humidity also

Resin glands come in three basic sizes:
60-70 microns includes Moroccan cannabis
and some other salivas.
80-11 0 microns is the most common size
range for many quality cannabis strains
135-150 micron sieves are necessary to capture the mature resin glands of many wellgrown, very resinous strains.
Remember, there are several sizes of resin
glands. Use the appropriate screen size to

remoistens dry plants, thus making it more difficult for resin to fall free.
A micron is one millionth of a meter
( 1/1,000,000 m) or one-thousandth of a millimeter (1 /1000 mm). This length is also
referred to as a micrometer, and the symbol
used to denote a micron is "~''.

Make sure the micron size is labeled on sieves.
Color coding helps, but there is nothing as good
as the micron size of the screen.
Once ~repared, break up buds and foliage
over a sreve, and tap the sieve lightly to jostle
resin heads through the pores. You can also rub
the leaves lightly on the sieve, but this will force
through more green foliage. Resin powder will

plant material, the more resin that will fall

cannabis back and forth across the sieve. Exert
minimal pressure on the cannabis to coax the
highest quality resin through the sieve. The first
layer of powder will be the purest. Sieved hash
contains more debris than most other methods,
but sieving is a simple and inexpensive method
to make hash.
Collect the powder below the sieve. Now the
resin powder is ready to press into a piece of
hash. Pressing generates a little heat which also
helps congeal the resin glands and debris
together.

Mila is a good friend, and she has carried the
hash torch for countless connoisseurs. She has
spent much of her life learning and teaching
how to extract more resin from cannabis. She
invented and popularized the Pollinator, a
motorized cylindrical-shaped sieve to separate
resin powder from leaf and buds. Mila has many
ongoing experiments with hash and cannabis,
one of which includes teaching the doctors in

The Pollinator consists of a drum that turns
inside a box. Cold, dried cannabis is placed
inside the drum that is made from 150-micron
screen. A motor turns the drum, and resin
glands fall through the 150-micron screen as the
cannabis tumbles inside. Resin is collected
below the drum.
Highest quality resin falls through the screen
first. Progressively lower quality resin falls
through the mesh the longer the drum turns.
More green matter and other adulterants fall
through the screen when the Pollinator turns for
longer periods of time.
First you must prepare the dry cannabis. Put it
in an airtight bag, and place the bag in the freezer for two hours. This will make the cannabis
hard and brittle, which makes the sieving
process much more efficient and productive.
Let the drum turn for two to five minutes. Use
a short-range ki tchen timer to make sure not to
let the drum run too long. As the drum turns, the
purest resin falls through the screen first. The
THC-rich resin falls onto the bottom of the box
underneath the drum.

Remove the magnetic lid from the drum, and add
small/eaves and buds. Do not put any sharp sticks or
objects into the drwn, because they could damage it.

Fill the drum about half full of dry leaf material so the
cannabis will hove enough room to tumble inside.
This action is important to facilitate resin gland separation from foliage.

Open the lid of the Pollinator, and lift out the
silkscreen drum. Pick up the drum and remove it
from the conlclining box.

Water Extraded Hash
Introduction
Hash extracted using cold water is known as
water hash, lce-0-l ator hash, ice hash, THC
crystal, etc. When· very pure, hash will bubble
releasing volatile resins when exposed to a
flame, hence the name Bubble Hash. This boiling effect is called "full-melt bubble" hash.
Modern water hash extraction started with
"Sadu Sam's Secret" that was published in

Secret is simple physics: resin is oil-based and
cannabis foliage is water-based. This difference
makes separating the two in aqueous solution
easy. Heavy, oil-soluble resin glands will not dissolve in water; they are heavier than water so
they will sink. Water-soluble material dissolves
in liquid, and foliage is lighter than water, which
makes it float!
A passage from HASHISH! states:
"Sadu Sam's Secret involves stirring a few
grams of pulverized flowers or freshly sieved
resin powder into a tall container of cool water
containing ten to twenty times the volume of
water to dry powder. Cool or cold water is essential because warm water softens the resin, which
tends to stick together forming an unmanageable lump ... The mixture must be stirred vigorously for several minutes until the lumps of the
powder disperse. Once stirring ceases, the differing particles in the suspension begin to separate.
Plant particles and other light debris (such as
plant "hairs") float to the surface. Small, immature resin glands also tend to float. Mature resin
glands and any dense debris such as sand and
mineral dust sink, settling to the bottom."
Sadu Sam and Mila (the Pollinator) are old
friends, and both live in Amsterdam, Holland.
Mila continued to play with the separation
method and refined it. Within a short time, she
combined the dry sieving process with ice-cold
water- the outcome was lce-0-Lator bags. They
are three waterproof nylon bags with progressively smaller micron silk screens sewn into the
bottom of each. Clean cannabis is chopped and
placed in ice-cold water in the bags. The water is
mixed. When the slurry settles, the resin glands
,)ass through the screens, and the foliage and
debris are retained in bags. The water is drained,
and a few nice clumps of high-quality hash
rema1n.
Bubble Man refined the process by adding
more bags with progressively smaller mesh. He
has been adding screens, and at the time of publication, he uses seven different screens. He
found that each screen separates unique sedi-

ments, some of which contain exceptionally
pure THC. TI1is hash is so pure that it bubbles
when heated. Bubble Man popularized this saying, "If it don't bubble, it ain't worth the trouble."
He is a legend on www.overgLow.com.
Water-soluble terpinoids found in cannabis
resin contribute to fragrance and taste. The
majori ty of these soluble terpinoids dissolve and
are washed out when extracting resin with
water. The result is often hash with little flavor
and aroma.
Now the hash is out of the bag! Many manufacturers have jumped on the bandwagon. Your
time and budget will dictate how many bags you
want to use for making water hash.
Use three bags and process the mix twice to
extract virtually all of the THC-rich resin. Keep the
wet plant material from the first water hash
extraction. Freeze it and process again to make
more resin. Or you can use five or more bags in
a single run and harvest different qualities, some
of which are very pure.
Ice-cold water makes trichomes brittle, and agitation knocks the heads off. Strain the mix
through filters for increased purity.
Use leaves that have visible resin. Using large
fan leaves or immature leaves will result in disappointing hash.
Use a mixer with paddles. If you can, find one
with long shanks on the paddles for easy, deep
mixing in a five-gallon (20 L) bucket. You can
cover the bucket when mixing to help contain
splashes. However, moving the mixer around

lce-0 -Lator Instructions
The lce-o-lator was popularized by Mila,
owner of the Pollinator, in Amsterdam, Holland.
This water extraction process is a simple, efficient method of extracting THC-paci< ed resin
crystals from cannabis plants. Using the !ce-Olater is very easy. Here is a brief recap of the
process. The instructions below are adapted
from Mila's site, www.gollinator.nl where there
is much more information on making hash.
You will need:
lce-0-Lator set
20-25-liter (5-gallon) bucket with lid
Kitchen mixer - Use the kind with paddles for
mixing. Do not use the kind with a short chopping blade.
Paper towels
Dinner plate
Plastic card
Large mixing spoon
± 4.5-11 pounds (2-5 kg) of ice cubes, enough
to keep the temperature down to 41 °F (5°C)

l<eep the temperature of the water just above
freezing at 41•F (5°C)
Put in the most resinous leaf trim available.
Make sure the chopped cannabis does not contain stems or other sharp plant parts that would
damage the precision screen. Prepare buds by
pulling apart or cutting into bits before introducing to the mix.
Fill the bucket with ice-cold water to six inches
{15 em) below the rim. Put the bags into the
bucket in the proper order. Make sure there are
no air bubbles trapped between the bags or the
bucket. The bags will hang straight down, nested inside one another and the bucket. Pull the
top edge of each bag over the rim of the bucket, hold it down and lock it in place with the
drawstring and sliding lock.
Now you are ready to throw in the frozen
cannabis.

Put up to seven ounces (200 gm) into the
water. Do not put too much plant material into
the water because it needs space to mix and for
the resin to separate and fall through the sieves
below. When there is too much plant material in
the water, many resin glands adhere to the
foliage.
Add more ice on top of the plant material. This
helps ensure the leaves get wet.
Fill the bucket with more water to within two
inches (5 em) of the top of the bucket. Let the
mix soak for 15 minutes. Time is needed for the
•
mass of foliage to become as cold as the water.
The temperature should be about 41 •F (5°C).
Cut two holes in the lid of the bucket-a little
bigger than the shafts of the mixer. Attach the
paddles of the mixer with the top of the lid in
between. Put the lid on the bucket, and turn the
mixer on at a low speed. The mixer will stir the
concoction. l<eep the mixer on and let it mix for
15 minutes.
Remove the lid. Use a spoon to move the plant
material on the perimeter to the center. The goal
here is to make sure everything mixes evenly.
Let the mix soak for five minutes longer. Replace
the lid and turn the mixer on again.
Repeat the process until all leaves have been
stirred with cold water. Mila likes to mix it for
about an hour so all the wet trim and leaves are
floating on top of the water.
Turn off the mixer and let the resin settle one
more time for about 15 minutes. Remove the
first bag that contains all the raw material. Close
the top and hang in a place where it can easily
drain. Remove the debris in the bag and turn it
inside out. Run water though the screen to wash
out any latent resin that may have gotten caught
in it.
Cleanliness is of paramount importance from
beginning to end!
Everything that falls in the second bag will end
up in the end product. When cleaning out the
first bag, make sure the crystals do not stick on
the outside of the second bag. Ample water
here is important. Remember, it is a rinsing and
separating operation.

Remove the last bag having the finest screen.
The water will drip out slower than from any
other bag. You may have to hold the bag
between your hands and sift the water back and
forth across the sieve in the bottom to evacuate
all the water because the accumulated hash
slurry in the bottom tends to block the sieve.
This part is fun! You can watch the slurry of hash
congeal as the water drips through the sieve in
the bottom of the bag.
Once the water is gone, the ever-changing
slurry of hash remains, seemingly floating on the
sieve in the bottom of the bag. If the slurry is
green and full of contaminating debris, rinse
carefully in cold water. The rinse will carry some
of the green matter through the sieve.
Concentrate the wet hash in the bottom of the
sieve. Fold the sieve and squeeze out more
water. Place a couple of paper towels on the

bottom of the screen to absorb more moisture.
Dance around the room with the hash in your
hands high above your head. You have made
your first lce-0-Lator hash!
Do not waste the cold water; start another
load! You can make up to five batches with the
same cold water!
When you are done with the water, pour it on
your plants. They love the nutrients!
Remove the semi-dry caked resin from the
screen. Scrape it out with a plastic credit card or
a small thin teaspoon.
Thoroughly rinse out all the bags to remove
resin and debris. Clean screens with 96 percent
pure alcohol so no oil-based resin remains.
Hang to dry.
Moisture must quickly be removed from the
resin powder to prevent mold. Crumble it up
and spread it out on a screen or hard surface. I
like a screen because you can sop up moisture
by pressing a paper towel under the screen.
Another option is to hand press all the water
out of the ball. Continue working the wet powder until it transforms into a cohesive ball of oily
hash.
Or you can hand press until you have a solid
ball. l<eep squeezing and pressing, water will
become visible on your hands.
Remove the last bit of moisture by flattening
out the ball and putting it in the freezer. Freezing
expands the volume of water, which will appear
on the surface of the hash. Simply wipe off the
ice when you remove the hash from the freezer.
'
When you press powder, the resin crystals will
break and the oil will be released. The mix will
darken as it oxidizes. The resin crystals from very
fresh leaf will remain white, a very high quality.

Separate hash with progressively smaller

Moiio has a full array of separating bags from
several manufacturers. His laboratory is set up in
the bathroom, with the tub the center of attention. He keeps the "laboratory" clean with a
shower head attached to a fl exible hose. Here is
the array of bags he uses to separate the trash
from the hash.
The "work bag" is the one that contains the
bulk of the processed resin-less leaf. The work
bag is usually drained and set aside so the
debris inside can be discarded at will.
Mofio likes bags with rigid sides. They perform
better because they retain their shape inside the
bucket and are easier to use when only one person is making water hash.

The process is done in two steps. First, he
washes and separates the resin glands from the
marijuana foliage using six screens. This process
washes out virtually all of the foliage and contaminants.
The hash-laden water that is left over after
passing through six bags is separated again by
running it through eight more bags. The resulting hash is very clean.

tion is very useful to process the leaf that is left
over after the harvest. Using an everyday washing machine will save hours of labor. Following
all the steps and paying attention to the water
temperature in this simple process will extract
all remaining cannabinoids from the leaves.
The best bet is to purchase the proper bags
that have been tested. Mila and other manufacturers make different bags for outdoor and
indoor crops. Plants grown outdoors have smaller resin heads than plants grown indoors and
require a smaller mesh bag to collect the resin.
A washing machine filled with cold water is
used to agitate the leaf and glands that are
located inside of a zipped silkscreen lce-0-Lator
bag. This process separates the resin glands
from the green leafy material. Once separated,

resin glands fall through the
sieve into the washing
machine water. The leafy
materiaI stays inside the bag.
The hash-laden water is evacuated out the washing
machine's drain hose and separated from the water in a
simple filtering process.
The machine is filled with ice
and ice-cold water. Cold water
is used to keep the resin
glands intact and facilitate
separation from the leaf. The
principle is simple. Resin is oilbased and leaf is water-based.
First, the Colombians place
paper bags of 500 grams of
leaf in the freezer for one and
a half hours. Cold temperatures make the leaves brittle,
which allows them to easily
separate from the resin
glands.
Next, the two, one-pound
(450 gm) bags of the cold
leaves are loaded into a
zipped lce-0-Lator bag. The
drum of the washing machine
is filled with very cold water.
Chunks of ice the size of your
fist are added to the water
until the desired temperature
of 41 °F WC) is achieved.
Two zipped lce-0-Lator bags
are loaded into the drum and
the machine turned on to agitate for 10-12 minutes. Two
bags are used to keep the
machine in balance. As the
machine agitates the bags,
resin glands slip out through
the mesh of the bags into the
water.
The next step is to evacuate

the resin-laden water out the drain. The drain
water is sifted through an lce-0-Lator bag to
remove any remaining leaf. The water is collected in a larger bag placed in a large container.
Once all the water is evacuated, they lift the
large bag from the container. The "clean" water
flowed out the sieve in the bottom of the big
bag, and the wet resin stayed in the big bag.
They squeeze the last of the water by hand out
of the big lce-0-Lator bag and the resulting
unpressed hash is set out to dry. Every one-kilo
bag of leaves yields 30-40 grams of dried resin.
In a single 14-hour day they can process 100
kilos of leaf and transform it into three kilos of
quality resin that is later pressed into hash.

Resin Extraction for Cooking
Cannabis butter and oil are simple to make.
Each takes a little time to make, but large batches can be processed and stored in the refrigerator or freezer.
The psychoactive cannabinoids dissolve in butter, cooking oil, or alcohol (see "Tinctures"
below). Dissolving the resin in the butter, oil, or
alcohol makes it available for absorption by the
body. Cannabis butter contains about 80 percent of the cannabinoids that were in the original foliage used to make it.
Heat 1.6 quarts (1.5 L) of water in a large pan
on the stove. Add 4 ounces ( 112 gm) of marijuana leaf, one pound of butter (or margarine)
and stir.
Bring the liquid to a boil. Put the lid on the pot
and simmer two hours on low heat, stirring
occasionally.
Strain the mix through a colander, catching the
liquid below. Press the wet foliage to get all the
liquid out.
Pour 0.5 quart (0.5 L) of boiling water over the
wet leaf to wash out remaining butter. Press the
leaves to squeeze out all the liquid possible.
Let the mix stand and cool. Within an hour or
two, the mix will separate- water on the bottom
and cannabis butter on top. You can speed the
process by placing the hot mix into the refrigerator.

Pour off and discard the water, and retain the
cannabis butter.
Use the butter in any recipe that calls for butter. Use small portions until you are familiar with
dosage and effects. Be careful when consuming;
the butter is quite potent!
Cannabis vegetable oil is made very much like
cannabis butter.
First, you substitute one quart (1 L) of vegetable oil instead of butter.
Heat 1.6 quarts (1.5 L) of water in a large pan
on the stove. Add 4 ounces (112 gm) of marijuana leaf, one quart (1 L) of vegetable oil, and
stir.
Bring the liquid to a boil. Put the lid on the pot,
and simmer two hours on low heat, stirring
occasionally.
Strain the mix through a colander, catching the
liquid below. Press the wet foliage to get all the
liquid out.
Pour 0.5 quart (0.5 L) of boiling water over the
wet leaf to wash out remaining butter. Press the
leaves to squeeze out all the liquid possible.
Let the mix stand and cool. Within an hour or
two, the mix will separate. Once completely separated, put the mix into the freezer. The water
will freeze in 4-6 hours. Pour off the cannabis
oil. If you are using olive or peanut oil, they will
coagulate in the freezer and cannot be poured
off. Use a spatula to scrape the oil from the
water.
The oil will liquefy at room temperature. It will
keep for about a month at room temperature.
Keep in the freezer for longer term storage.
Use cannabis oil in recipes as you would any
vegetable oil.

Cannabis Tinctures
Use liquor as a solvent to dissolve resin glands
into a potent cannabis potion. You can use any
liquor, but the higher the percentage of alcohol,
or proof, the quicker and more efficient the
process. You can let the spirits evaporate so the
tincture contains virtually no alcohol.

Welf·made carmabis ail is extremely poten~ often
registering more than 70 percent THCI

If you prefer a flavored drink with alcohol, use
Kahlua, Cointreau, Galliano, etc. Just remember,
liqueurs contain a lower percentage of alcohol,
and the extraction process will take longer.
Clean 4 ounces (112 gm) of clean cannabis
leaf in two quarts (about 2 liters) of lukewarm
(90°F [32°C)) water. Stir the leaf and water so
they are well-mixed and the leaf is wet. Keeping
the leaves whole makes them easier to work
with. Strain out the leaves with a colander, let·
ting the greenish water drain into a receptacle.
This step will wash out much of the green
chlorophyll.
Place the wet foliage in a bowl and cover with
one quart (0.95 l) of 80 proof alcohol of your
choice. Stir the blend until the alcohol and
foliage are well-mixed. Make sure all foliage is
covered with alcohol. Put a lid on the bowl so
the alcohol cannot evaporate, and let it sit for 48
hours.

Take the lid off the bowl. and let the mix sit
uncovered for 12 hours, until about half the
alcohol evaporates.
Stir the brew again so it is well-mixed, and
pour it through a coffee filter into a receptacle.
Use the coffee filter to wring all liquid out of
leaves.
Pour the alcohol through the leaves again, and
wring out the liquid.
You will have about two cups of cannabis tincture concentrate that is ready to use. Or you can
boil the mixture down to concentrate it more.
The tincture will have 60 percent or more of the
THC contained in the entire four ounces (11 2
gm) of raw material.
The tincture can be added to recipes in lieu of
other liquids such as water, wine, etc.
Store concentrated tinctures in a cool, dark
place to avoid early degradation. Heat and light
degrade tinctures quickly. Use the tincture in
one to three months.
Be very careful when you drink the tincture; it
is potent! The buzz is similar to the one you get
when eating cannabis, but it comes on in less
time.
This is a shorthand version of cannabis extraction using butter, oil. and alcohol. For more com·

Cookbook, by Tom Flowers, Flowers Publishing,

Hash or Cannabis Oil
Hash oil is a concentrate of hash or marijuana
(cannabis oil) that has been dissolved in nasty
hydrocarbon solvents such as ether and alcohol
to extract the THC. Hash and cannabis oil fre,quently retain residues from solvents used to
extract the THC. These residues are a health risk.
The oils can be very concentrated and potent.
Honey oil was somewhat popular in America
in the early 1970s. The oil was a translucent
golden-amber color. The oil transformed from
stiff, toffee-like consistency to runny oil when
warmed. Cannabis oils are normally dark in
color because they contain chlorophyll and
other contaminants. Filtering the oil through

Volatile solvent extraction
We do not recommend volatile solvent extraction because it requires the use of dangerous
chemical solvents such as isopropyl alcohol,
ethyl alcohol, and white gas.
Cannabis is soaked in the solvent, and the solvent is removed by evaporation. The resulting
residual is a sludge that contains chlorophyll,
plant waxes, other debris, and cannabinoids.
Isomerization is a chemical resin extraction
process that was very popular in the 1970s and
early 1980s. The process has fall en out of favor
because of the harsh and dangerous chemical
solvents-white gas, sulfuric add, hydrochloric
add, etc.-used in the process.
Butane cannabis oil is made by passing
butane gas through chopped cannabis. TI1e
butane dissolves the THC and transports it out a
drain where it is collected. The captured butane
contains THC. The butane is evaporated away by
setting the collection container in a pan of warm
wat·er. Once the butane has dissipated completely, the residual honey-colored oil is scraped
from the bottom of the collection pan.
Butane hash oil is dangerous to make because
the process involves using a quantity of butane
in an open container. The fumes are toxic and a
small flame or spark could cause the butane to
explode. People who make butane hash should
make it in a well-ventilated or outdoor location.

Pressing Hash
Introduction
Once collected, resin powder is often pressed
to facilitate handling and storage. Bulky resin
powder is awkward to handle. It is easily spilled,
blown away, and contaminated by dust and dirt.
Resin powder is also more difficult to smoke,
especially if no screen is available. Once pressed
into a piece of hash, the resin is easy to handle,
store, transport, and consume. Proper pressing
is essential for storage and to slow decomposition.
Pressing ruptures resin glands and warms the
resin, causing many volatile aromatic terpenoids
to release their aromas and flavors.
You can press the resin powder by hand or
with a mechanical device. You can elect to add
heat, a drop or two of water, or alcohol while
pressing to make less-pure hash stick together
in a block.
Mechanical presses must be precise and align
well so pressed hash does not ooze out seams.
When pressed, heat and friction cause the outer
layer of pressed hash to oxidize and turn darker
than the interior. In fact, hash can have a dark
exterior and a blonde interior packed with
creamy resin glands.
Make sure to pre-press water-extracted hash
in a piece of cellophane to contain it and help

get rid of the water. The cellophane will give the
pressed hash a shiny skin.

Pressing Small Amounts of Hash

Remove " few clumps of WC/ter-extracted hash from
the glass cone.

Ball up the clumps of resin and work it in the palm
of your hand. pressing it together with your thumb.

By hand pressing, you experience the transformation of the resin powder into your very own
piece of fragrant, dense hash.
To hand press, collect one to four grams of
resin powder in the palm of your hand and
apply pressure to the powder, working it
between the palms of your hands. Also push
your thumb into your palm full of resin powder
to work it into a piece of hash. Continue this
process for 10·30 minutes until the piece of
hash is completely pliable and whole. Heat will
be generated and help rupture and meld the
resin glands together. Relatively pure resin powder will congeal faster than less-potent powders
that contain impurities. But a little vegetable
matter and debris gives hash different flavors
and more body.
Potent resin powder is a creamy white to gold
in color. Pressing the powder together and
working it in your hands ruptures and oxidizes
resin glands, which makes the mass turn ever
darker.

Bottle Pressing
Press small amounts of resin powder between
cellophane to form a pancake. Fill a long cylindrical bottle with warm water and use it as a
"rolling pin" to press the pancake of hash.
Continue to knead the resin in your hands until it
forms into a solid shape.

Press the resin into a wafer. Check out tl!is com·
pressed resin powder. You can see the resin glisten!

Now pressed into a wafer, the piece of hash will be
easy to smoke and will burn evenly.

Shoe Hash
Press small amounts of hash by putting resin
powder in cellophane and putting it under your
heel inside your shoe. Walk around for an hour
or so, doing what you would normally. Take your
shoe off and voila, fresh hash!
You can use a laminator-the kind that laminates photos and documents between two
sheets of plastic-to press your hash! Simply
sprinkle out the best resin powder you can
make onto a piece of cellophane. Lay another
piece of cellophane on top. Roll it with a bottle
full of hot water to get it into preliminary shape
and make it easy to work with. Remove the
piece of hash from the cellophane; treat it like
you would a document and laminate it. If your
laminator can control the level of heat, wonderful! You are now ready to pack hash for a rainy
day!

Mechanical Pressing
Place resin powder in a plastic bag or cellophane wrapper to contain it while pressing. All
the powder will be pressed within the wrapper
into a brick or plaque of hash. Poke a few small
holes in the bag before pressing to allow
trapped air to escape. The bag is placed into a
heavy-duty steel mold, and pressure is applied
with a hydraulic jack. Hydraulic jacks have a
capacity from 10-20 tons and are mounted to
heavy-duty steel frames that normally contain a
100-gram mold.
The pressure exerted to form a cohesive block
is contingent upon the volume of contaminants
in the powder. The more pure the resin powder,
the less pressure it takes to form it into a block.
If your hash was made with water, make sure
it is totally dry before pressing to avoid mold.
Water hash does not react like dry-sieved hash
when pressed. Resin has been melded together
in a different way than dry powder.
Pressing the resin when it is wet will trap mois·
ture inside the hash. The hash will not dry completely, and it will not properly gel together later.
It will retain a powdery consistency.

Roll the wine bottle over the dry resin powder that is
wrapped in cellophane.

T7ris small wafer of pressed "pollen'' can be broken
off and vaporized or smoked in a pipe.

Dry-sieved resin powder will press easily and
stay together under lower pressure when it is
relatively pure. If it is adulterated with impurities, more pressure and heat will be necessary

to press it into a block.
Add a little heat to hard-to-press hash that
contains impurities. The heat will help the mass
congeal so bricks do not need excessive pressure to stay together. But do not heat the resin
too much or it will be damaged. Do not forget
that pressing also increases heat.
You can also add a drop of alcohol in the form
of brandy, whisky, bourbon, rum, etc. Higher
alcohol content spirits are favored. The alcohol
melds the glands together. Add only a drop at a
time; alcohol takes a few minutes to completely penetrate and act. Be careful, add only a little

Hammering

Wrap a gram or two of resin in a bit of cellophane.
Place it in the heel of your shoe to press into "shoe
hash:'

Hammering hash is a popular method of
pressing in Morocco but uncommon in
Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and North
America. Hammering bursts and blends resin
glands together into a cohesive mass. Often
resin glands are hammered before being
hydraulically pressed into plaques.
To hammer hash, place resin powder into an
extra heavy-duty plastic bag. Place the bag on a
wooden bench, tree stump, board, etc. Place a
piece of plywood over the bag. Whack the plywood with a hammer until the resin powder
forms a cohesive pancake. Remove the hash
from the bag and fold
once or twice to make it
smaller and thicker.
Repeat the hammering
and folding process
until the resin glands
transform into a sticky
piece of hash. Apply a
little heat if the hash is
slow to form.

Storing Hash

My favorite way to store high quality
water hash is to put it in a glass tube. This
way all the resin stays intact until it is consumed. Upon smoking, you should press it
a little so it will burn evenly.

Sodium Chloride and Water Quality
Water with high levels of chloride frequently
contains high levels of sodium, but the opposite
is not true. Water with high levels of sodium
does not necessarily contain excessive levels of
chloride (chlorine).
At low levels sodium appears to bolster yields,
possibly acting as a partial substitute to compensate for potassium deficiencies. But when
excessive, sodium is toxic and induces deficiencies of other nutrients, primarily potassium, calcium, and magnesium.
Chloride (chlorine) is essential to the use of
oxygen during photosynthesis, and it is necessary for root and leaf cell division. Chloride is
vital to increase the cellular osmotic pressure,
modify the stomata regulation, and augment

the plant's tissue and moisture content. A solution concentration of less than 140 parts per
million (ppm) is usually safe for marijuana, but
some varieties may show sensitivity when
foliage turns pale green and wilts. Excessive
chlorine causes the leaf tips and margins to
burn and causes the leaves to turn a bronze
color.
Simple water filters do not clean dissolved
solids from the water. Such filters remove only
debris emulsified (suspended) in water; releasing dissolved solids from their chemical bond is
more complex. A reverse-osmosis machine uses
small polymer, semi-permeable membranes
that allow pure water to pass through and filter
out the dissolved solids from the water.
Reverse-osmosis machines are the easiest and
most efficient means to clean raw water.

Check the pH of the irrigation water
and adjust when necessary.

The drawing shows that pure water with no salts or dissolved solids
migrates to the solution with more dissolved solids.

Osmosis
The roots draw the nutrient solution up the
pia nt by the process of osmosis. Osmosis is the
tendency of the fluids to pass through a semipermeable membrane and mix with each other
until the fluids are equally concentrated on both
sides of the membrane. Semi-permeable membranes located in the root hairs allow specific

nutrients that are dissolved in the water to enter
the plant while the other nutrients and impurities
are excluded. Since salts and sugars are concentrated in the roots, the electrical conductivity (EC)
inside the roots is (almost) always higher than
that outside the roots. Transporting the nutrients
by osmosis works, because it depends on relative
concentrations of each individual nutrient on
each side of the membrane; it does not depend
on the total dissolved solids (TDS) or EC of the
solution. For nutrients to be drawn in by the roots
via osmosis, the strength of the individual elements must be greater than that of the roots.
But, the transport of water (instead of nutrients)
across the semi-permeable membrane depends
on EC. For example, if the EC is greater outside
the roots than inside, the plant dehydrates as the
water is drawn out of the roots. In other words,
salty water with a high EC can dehydrate the
plants.
Reverse-osmosis machines are used to separate the dissolved solids from the water. These
machines move the solvent (water) through the
semi-permeable membrane, but the process is
reversed. It moves from lower concentrations to
higher. The process is accomplished by applying
pressure to the "tainted" water to force only
"pure" water through the membrane. The water
is not totally "pure" with an EC of "0," but most of
the dissolved solids are removed. The efficiency
of reverse osmosis depends on the type of membrane, the pressure differential on both sides of
the membrane, and the chemical composition of
the dissolved solids in the tainted water.
Unfortunately, common tap water often contains high levels of sodium (Na), calcium (Ca),
alkaline salts, sulfur (S), and chlorine (CI). The pH
could also be out of the acceptable 6.5 to 7
range. Water containing sulfur is easily smelled
and tasted. Saline water is a little more difficult to
detect. Water in coastal areas is generally full of
salt that washes inland from the ocean. Dry
regions that have less than 20-inches-annual
rainfall also suffer from alkaline soil and water
that is often packed with alkaline salts.
Table salt, sodium chloride (NaCI), is added to
many household water systems. A small amount
of chlorine, below 140 ppm, does not affect marijuana growth, but higher levels cause foliage
chlorosis and stunt growth. Do not use salt-soft-

ened water. Salty, brackish, salt-softened water is detrimental
to cannabis. Chlorine also tends to acidify soil after repeated
applications. The best way to get chlorine out of the water is
to let it sit one or two days in an open container. n,e chlorine
will evaporate (volatilize) as a gas when it comes in contact
with the air. If chlorine noticeably alters soil pH, adjust it with
a commercial "pH UP" product or hydrated lime.
The metric system facilitates the measurement of "dry
residue per liter." Measure the dry residue per liter by pouring
a liter of water on a tray and allowing it to evaporate. The
residue of dissolved solids that remains after all of the water
evaporates is the "dry residue per liter." The residue is measured in grams. Try this at home to find out the extent of impurities. Fertilizers have a difficult time penetrating root tissue
when they must compete with resident dissolved solids.
Water that is loaded with high levels of dissolved solids (salts
in solution) is possible to manage but requires different tactics. Highly saline water that contains sodium will block the
uptake of potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Salt-laden
water will always cause problems. If water contains 300 ppm
or less dissolved solids, allow at least 25 percent of the irrigation water to drain out of the bottom of containers with each
watering. If row woter contains more than 300 ppm of dissolved solids, use a reverse-osmosis device to purify the
water. Add nutrients to pure water as a way to avoid many
nutrient problems.
Dissolved salts, caused by saline water and fertilizer, quickly
build up to toxic levels in container gardens. Excessive salts
inhibit seed germination, burn the root hairs and tips or edges
of leaves, and stunt the plant. Flush excess salt buildup from
growing mediums by applying two gallons of water per gallon
of medium and repeat leaching using a mild pH-corrected fertilizer solution. Leach growing medium every two to four
weeks, if using soft water or saline water. Hard water and well
water in dry climates are often alkaline, and usually contain
notable amounts of calcium and magnesium. Cannabis uses
large quantities of both nutrients, but too much calcium and
magnesium can build up in soil. In general, water that tastes
good to people also tastes good to cannabis.

Flushing plants with plain water will
wash out most built-up toxic salts.
Flush again with a diluted nutrient
solution.

Plants in small containers require
more frequent watering.

Irrigation
Large plants use more water than small plants, but there are
many more variables than size that dictate a plant's water
consumption. The age of the plant, container size, soil texture,
temperature, humidity, and ventilation all contribute to water
needs. Change any one of these variables, and the water consumption will change. Good ventilation is essential to promote a free flow of fluids, transpiration, and rapid growth. The
healthier a plant, the faster it grows and the more water it
needs.

When they are small, plants in
medium-sized containers can be
watered every other day.

water meter takes the guesswork out
of watering. Remember to keep probes
clean for an accurate reading.

Tip the containers to check if they are
heavily laden with water. Irrigate the
light containers.

Add a few drops of biodegradable liquid dish soap concentrate to the irriga·
lion water. Detergent makes the water
penetrate the soil more thoroughly.

Small plants with a small root system in small containers
must be watered often. Water frequently- as soon as the soil
surface dries out. If exposed to wind, the small plants will dry
out very quickly.
Irrigate soil and soilless mixes when they are dry one-half
inch below the surface. As long as the drainage is good, it is
difficult to overwater fast-growing cannabis. Four-week-old
clones flowering in 2- to 3-gallon (7.5 to 11 L) containers need
to be irrigated once or twice daily. In fact, most growers prefer
smaller containers because they are easier to control.
Irrigate larger plants in the vegetative and flowering stages
when soil is dry one-half inch below the surface. Flowering
marijuana uses high levels of water to carry on rapid floral formation. Withholding the water stunts the flower formation.
Plants that are exposed to wind dry out much faster.
Outdoor, terrace, and patio plants will use up to three or four
times more water on a hot, windy day. l<eeping up with the
watering is difficult and time-consuming. Use an automated
watering system or break the wind to lessen its impact on the
plants. Mulch will also lessen the evaporation from the soil.
Use plenty of water, and allow up to 10 percent runoff during each watering. The runoff will prevent the fertilizer from
building up in the soil. Water early in the day, so excess water
will evaporate from the soil surface and the leaves. Leaving the
foliage and the soil wet overnight invites a fungal attack.
Moisture meters take most of the guesswork out of irrigating.
They can be purchased for less than $30 and are well worth
the money. The meter measures exactly how much water the
soil contains at any level or point. Often the soil will not hold
the water evenly, and it develops dry pockets. Checking the
moisture with a finger provides an educated guess but disturbs the root system. A moisture meter will give an exact
moisture reading without disturbing the roots.
Cultivate the soil surface to allow the water to penetrate
evenly and guard against dry soil pockets. It also keeps the
water from running down the crack between the inside of the
pot and the soil and out the drain holes. Gently break up and
cultivate the top half inch of the soil with your fingers or a
salad fork. Be careful not to disturb the tiny surface roots.
After you develop some skill at knowing when the plants
need water, you can check to see how heavy they are simply
by tipping them. Once you get the hang of it, all you will have
to do is tip each container.
It is easier to keep pots in straight lines when growing and
watering, and it is much easier to keep track of watered pots
when they are in a straight line.
Overwatering is a common problem, especially with small
plants. Too much water drowns the roots by cutting off their
supply of oxygen. If you have symptoms of overwatering, buy
a moisture meter! It will let both you and your garden breathe

easier. Sometimes, parts of the soil are oveiWatered and other
soil pockets remain bone-dry. Cultivating the soil surface,
allowing even water penetration, and using a moisture meter
will overcome this problem. One of the main causes of overwatering is poor air ventilation! The plants need to transpire
water into the air. If there is nowhere for this wet, humid air
to go, gallons of water are locked in the grow room air. Wellventilated air carries this moist air away, replacing it with fresh,
dry air. If using trays to catch runoff water, use a turkey baster,
large syringe, or sponge to draw the excess water from the
tray. Signs of oveiWatering are: leaves curled down and yellowed, waterlogged and soggy soil, fungal growth, and slow
growth. Symptoms of oveiWatering are often subtle, and inexperi enced gardeners may not see any blatant symptoms for a
long time.
Marijuana does not like soggy soil. Soil kept too wet drowns
the roots, squeezing out the oxygen. This causes slow growth
and possible fungal attack. Poor drainage is most often the
cause of soggy soil. It is compounded by poor ventilation and
high humidity.
Underwatering is less of a problem; however, it is fairly
common if small (1-2 gallon) pots are used and the grower
does not realize the water needs of rapid growing plants.
Small containers dry out quickly and may require daily watering. If forgotten, water-starved plants become stunted. Once
tender root hairs dry out, they die. Most growers panic when
they see their prize-marijuana plants wilt in bone-dry soil. Dry
soil, even in pockets, makes root hairs dry up and die. It seems
to take forever for the roots to grow new root hairs and
resume rapid growth.
Add a few drops (one drop per pint) of a biodegradable,
concentrated liquid soap like Castille® or lvoryoo to the water.
It will act as a wetting agent by helping the water penetrate
the soil more efficiently, and it will guard against dry soil pockets. Most soluble fertilizers contain a wetting agent. Apply
about one-quarter to one-half as much water/fertilizer as the
plant is expected to need, and then wait 10 to 15 minutes for
it to totally soak in. Apply more water/fertilizer until the soil is
evenly moist. If trays are underneath the pots, let excess water
remain in the trays a few hours or even overnight before
removing it with a large turkey baster.
Another way to thoroughly wet pots is to soak the containers in water. This is easy to do with small pots. Simply fill a 5gallon (19 L) bucket with 3 gallons ( 11 l) of water. Submerge
the smaller pot inside the larger pot, for a minute or longer,
until the growing medium is completely saturated. Wetting
plants thoroughly insures against dry soil pockets.
Having a readily accessible water source is very convenient,
and it saves time and labor. A 4 x 4-foot garden containing 16
healthy plants in 3-gallon (11 L) pots needs 10 to 25 gallons

Pur a saucer under the plants to

(40-100 L) of water per week. Water weighs eight pounds a
gallon (1 kg per L). That's a lot of containers to fill, lift, and
spill. Carrying water in containers from the bathroom sink to
the garden is okay when plants are small, but when they are
large, it is a big, sloppy, regular job. Running a hose into the
garden saves much labor and mess. A lightweight, half-inch
hose is easy to handle and is less likely to damage the
plants. If the water source has hot and cold water running
out of the same tap, and it is equipped with threads, attach
a hose and irrigate wi th tepid water. Use a dishwasher coupling if the faucet has no threads. The hose should have an
on/ off valve at the outlet, so water flow can be controlled
while watering. A rigid water wand will save many broken
branches while leaning over to water in tight quarters. Buy a
water wand at the nursery or construct one from plastic PVC
pipe. Do not leave water under pressure in the hose for
more than a few minutes. Garden hoses are designed to
transport water, not hold it under pressure, which may cause
it to rupture.
To make a siphon or gravity-fed water system, place a barrel, at least four feet high, in the grow room. Make sure it has
a lid to reduce the evaporation and the humidity. If the grow
room is too small for the barrel, move it to another room.
The attic is a good place because it promotes good pressure.
Place a siphon hose in the top of the tank, or install a PVC
on/ off valve near the bottom of the barrel. It is easy to walk
off and let the barrel overflow. An inexpensive device that
measures the ga lions of water added to the barrel is available at most hardware stores. You can also install a float
valve in the barrel to meter out the water and retain a constant supply.
Drip systems deliver nutrient solution one drop at a time
or in low volume, via a low-pressure plastic pipe with friction
fittings. Water flows down the pipe and out the emitter one
drop at a time or at a very slow rate. The emitters that are
attached to the main hose are either spaghetti tubes or a
nozzle dripper actually emitting from the main hose. Drip
irrigation kits are available at garden stores and building centers. You can also construct your own drip system from component parts.
Drip systems offer several advantages. Once set up, drip
systems lower watering maintenance. Fertilizer may also be
injected into the irrigation system (fertigation); naturally, this
facilitates fertilization but gives the same amount of water
and nutrient to each plant. If setting up a drip system, make
sure the growing medium drains freely to prevent soggy soil
or salt buildup. If you are growing clones that are all the
same age and size, a drip system would work very well.
However, if you are growing many different varieties of
plants, they may need different fertilizer regimens.

I interviewed several growers that loved the convenience
and constant feeding-ability of their drip systems. All the
growers irrigated (fertigated) with mild nutrient solution. They
mixed the nutrient solution in a reservoir and pumped it
through plastic feeder hoses. They also grew clones in smaller containers and kept root growth to a minimum by keeping
the nutrients and the water in constant supply.
A drip system attached to a timer disperses nutrient solution
at regular intervals. If using such a system, check the soil for
water application daily. Check several pots daily to ensure
they are watered evenly and that all the soil gets wet. Drip
systems are very convenient and indispensable when you
have to be away for a few days. However, do not leave a drip
system on its own for more than four consecutive days, or
you could return to a surprise!
Drip systems cost a few dollars to set up, but with the consistency they add to a garden, their expense is often paid off
by a bountiful yield. Be careful! Such an automated system
could promote negligence. Remember that gardens need
daily care. If everything is automated, the garden still needs
monitoring. All the vital signs: moisture, pH, ventilation,
humidity, etc., still need to be checked and adjusted daily.
Au tomation, when applied properly, adds consistency, uniformity, and usually a higher yield.
One indoor grower I met was out of town for five consecutive days every week. He watered and fertilized his plants. He
put containerized plants in a tray with 2-inch-tall (6 ern) sides
and watered the plants from above until the tray was full of
water. He left for five days, and the plants needed no watering while he was gone. He used regular potting soil and
added about 10 percent perlite. His plants needed maintenance when he returned, but the plants grew quite well.

Misdiagnosed Disorders
Many indoor garden problems, and to a lesser degree outdoor problems, are misdiagnosed as a lack of fertilizer. Often,
disease and insects cause such problems. Other times, problems are caused by an imbalanced pH of the growing medium and water. A pH between 6.5 and 7 in soil and 5.8 to 6.5
in hydroponics will allow nutrients to be chemically available;
above or below this range, several nutrients become less
available. For example, a full point movement in pH represents a tenfold increase in either alkalinity or acidity. This
means that a pH of 5.5 would be ten times more acidic than
a pH of 6.5. In soil, a pH below 6.5 may cause a deficiency in
calcium, which causes root tips to burn and leaves to get fungal infections and dead spots on foliage. A pH over 7 could
slow down the plant's iron intake and result in chlorotic
leaves causing veins to yellow.

Incorrect pH contributes to most serious nutrient disorders in organic-soil gardens. Many
complex biological processes occur between
organic fertilizers and the soil during nutrient
uptake. The pH is critical to the livelihood of
these activities. When the pH fluctuates in a
hydroponic garden, the nutrients are still available in the solution for uptake, and the pH is not
as critical. Electrical conductivity is the most critical indicator of plant health and nutrient uptake
in hydroponics.
Once a plant shows symptoms, it has already
undergone severe nutritional stress. It will take
time for the plant to resume vigorous growth.
Correct identification of each symptom as soon
as it occurs is essential to help plants retain
vigor. Indoor, greenhouse, and some outdoor
marijuana crops are harvested so fast that plants
do not have time to recover from nutrient imbalances. One small imbalance could cost a week
of growth. That could be more than 10 percent
of the plant's life!

Do not confuse nutrient
deficiencies or toxicities with
insect and disease damage or
poor cultural practices.
The temperature within the
leaves can climb to an excess
of 110°F (43°C). It happens
easily because the leaves
store the heat radiated by the
lamp. At 11 0°F (43°C), the
internal chemistry of a marijuana leaf is disrupted. The
manufactured proteins are
broken down and become
unavailable to the plant. As
the internal temperature of
the leaves climbs, they are
forced to use and evaporate
more water. About 70 percent of the plant's energy is
used in this process.
The basic elements of the
environment
must
be
checked and maintained at
specific levels to avoid problems. Check each of the vital
signs-air, light, soil, water,
temperature, humidity, etc.,and fine-tune the environment, especially ventilation,
before deciding that plants
are nutrient deficient.
Nutrient deficiencies are
less common when using
fresh potting soil fortified
with micronutrients. If the soil
or water supply is acidic, add
dolomite lime to buffer the
soil pH and to keep it sweet.
Avoid nutrient problems by
using fresh planting mix,
clean water, and a complete
nutrient solution. Maintain
the EC and pH at proper levels, and flush the system with
mild nutrient solution every
four weeks.

COMMON CULTURALPROBLEMS
Here is a short list of some of the most common cultural
problems. Some of them result in nutrient deficiencies.
1. Lack of ventilation: Leaves are stifled and unable to
function, causing slow growth and poor consumption of
water and nutrients.
2. Lack of light: Nutrients are used poorly, photosynthesis is slow, stems stretch, and growth is scrawny.
3. Humidity: High humidity causes the plants to use less
water and more nutrients. Grow th is slow because stomata are not able to open and increase the transpiration.
Low humidity stresses the plants because they use too
much water.
4. Temperature: Both low and high temperatures slow
the growth of plants. Large fluctuations in temperaturemore than 15 to 20°F or 8 to 10°C- causes slow growth
and slows the plant's process.
5. Spray application damage: Sprays are phytotoxic, and
they can burn the foliage if the spray is too concentrated
or if sprayed during the heat of the day.
6. Ozone damage: See Chapter Thirteen "Air," for more
information on ozone damage.
7. Overwatering: Soggy soil causes a menagerie of
problems. It cuts the air from the roots, which retards the
nutrient intake. The plant's defenses weaken. Roots rot
when severe.
8. Underwatering: Dry soil causes nutrient transport to
slow severely. It causes nutrient deficiencies and sick
foliage, and the roots die.
9. Light burn: Burned foliage is susceptible to pest and
disease attack.
10. Indoor air pollution: This causes very difficult-to-solve
plant problems. Always be aware of chemicals leaching
or vaporizing from the pressboards and other building
materials. Such pollution causes plant growth to slow to
a crawl.
11. Hot soil: Soil over 90°F (32°C) will harm the roots.
Often, outdoor soil that is used in the containers warms
up to well over 100°F (38°C).
12. Roots receiving light: Roots turn green if the light
shines through the container or the hydroponic system.
Roots require a dark environment. Their function slows
substantially when they turn green.

Nutrients
Nutrients are elements that the plant needs to
live. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are
absorbed from the air and the water. The rest of
the elements, called nutrients, are absorbed
from the growing medium and nutrient solu-

tion. Supplemental nutrients supplied in the
form of a fertilizer allow marijuana to reach its
maximum potential. Nutrients are grouped into
three categories: macronutrients or primary
nutrients, secondary nutrients, and micronutrients or trace elements. Each nutrient in the
above categories can be further classified as
either mobile or immobile.
Mobile nutrients-nitrogen (N), phosphorus
(P), potassium (1<), magnesium (Mg), and zinc
(Zn)- are able to translocate, move from one
portion of the plant to another as needed. For
example, nitrogen accumulated in older leaves
translocates to younger leaves to solve a deficiency. The result, deficiency symptoms appear
on the older, lower leaves first.
Immobile nutrients-calcium (Ca), boron (B),
chlorine (CI), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe),
manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), silicon
(Si) and sulfur (S)-do not translocate to new
growing areas as needed. They remain deposited in their original place in older leaves. This is
the reason deficiency symptoms appear first in
the upper, new leaves on top of the plant.
Mobile nutrients translocate within a plant.
They move to the specific part of the plant
where they are needed; this causes the older
leaves to show defi ciencies first.

Macronutrients

Nitrogen (N) - mobile
I would like to thank the scientists at
Canna Coco, Breda, Netherlands for information about nutrient deficiencies and
toxicities in cannabis. The research team at
Canna has been experimenting with
cannabis in their fully-equipped scientific
laboratory for 20 years. Maul<, head scientist, has made numerous discoveries, and
proven them scientifically, about the nutritional needs of the cannabis plant. Hit
their web site at

www.canna.com

Practical Information: Marijuana loves nitrogen and requires high levels of it during vegetative growth but lower levels during the balance
of life. Nitrogen is easily washed away and must
be replaced regularly, especially during vegetative growth. Excess levels of nitrogen in harvested plants cause the dried marijuana to burn
poorly.
Technical Information: Nitrogen regulates the
cannabis plant's ability to make proteins essential for new protoplasm in the cells. Electrically
charged nitrogen allows the plant to tie proteins, hormones, chlorophyll, vitamins, and
enzymes together. Nitrogen is essential for the
production of amino acids, enzymes, nucleic
acids, and chlorophyll and alkaloids. This important nutrient is mainly responsible for leaf and

stem growth, as well as overall size and vigor.
Nitrogen is most active in young buds, shoots,
and leaves. Ammonium (NH.,.~) is the most
readily available form of nitrogen. Be careful
when using too much of this form; it can burn
the plants. Nitrate (NO)·)- the nitrate form of
nitrogen- is much slower to assimilate than
ammonium. Hydroponic fertilizers use this slower-acting nitrogen compound and mix it with
ammon1um.
Deficiency: Nitrogen is the most common
nutrient deficiency. The symptoms include slow
growth. Lower leaves cannot produce chlorophyll and become yellow between the veins
while the veins remain green. Yellowing progresses through the entire leaf, eventually causing it to die and drop off. Stems and the leaves'
undersides may turn reddish-purple, but this
can aIso be a sign of a phosphorus deficiency.
Nitrogen is very mobile, and it dissipates into the
environment quickly. It must be added regularly
to sustain fast-growing gardens.
Progression of deficiency symptoms at a
glance:

Older leaves yellow between the veins (interveinal chlorosis).
Older bottom leaves turn entirely yellow.
More and more leaves yellow. Severely affected leaves drop.
Leaves might develop reddish-purple stems
and veins on leaf undersides.
Progressively younger leaves develop interveinal chlorosis.
All foliage yellows and the leaf drop is severe.
Treat deficiency by fertilizing with N or a com-

plete N-P-K fertilizer. You should see results in
four to five days. Fast-acting organic sources of
nitrogen include seabird guano, fish emulsion,
and blood meal. Growers also report excellent
results by adding bio-fertilizers (see Additives
below) to stimulate the uptake of nitrogen.
Toxicity: An overdose of nitrogen will cause
excessively lush foliage that is soft and susceptible to stress, including insect and fungal attacks.
The stems become weak and they may fold over
easily. The vascular transport tissue breaks
down, and water uptake is restricted. In severe
cases, leaves turn a brown ish-copper color, dry,

and fall off. Roots develop slowly, and they tend
to darken and rot. Flowers are smaller and
sparse. Ammonium toxicity is most common in
acidic soils, while nitrate toxicity is more prevalent in alkaline soil.

Phosphorus (P) - mobile
Practical Information: Cannabis uses the
highest levels of phosphoru s during germination, seedling, cloning, and flowering. Super
Bloom fertilizers, designed for flowering, have
high levels of phosphorus.
Technical Information: Phosphorus is necessary for photosynthesis and provides a mechanism for the energy to transfer within the plant.
Phosphorus-one of the components of DNA,
many being enzymes and proteins-is associated with overall vigor, resin, and seed production. The highest concentrations of phosphorus
are found in rootgrowing tips, growing
shoots, and vascular
tissue.

smaller,

seed yield is poor, and plants become very vulnerable to fungal and insect attack. Phosphorus
deficiencies are aggravated by clay, acidic, and
soggy soils. Zinc is also necessary for proper utilization of phosphorus.
Deficiencies are somewhat common and are
often misdiagnosed. Deficiencies are most common when the growing-medium pH is above 7
and phosphorus is unable to be absorbed properly; the soil is acidic (below 5.8) and/or there
is an excess of iron and zinc; the soil has
become fixated (chemically bound) with phosphates.
Progression of deficiency symptoms at a
glance:
Stunted and very slow-growth plants.
Dark bluish-green leaves, often with dark
blotches.
Plants are smaller overall.
When blotches overcome the leaf stem, the
leaf turns bronzish-purple, contorts, and drops.
Treat deficiency by lowering the pH to 5.5-6.2
in hydroponic units; 6 to 7 for clay soils; and
5.5-6.5 for potting soils so phosphorus will
become available. If the soil is too acidic, and an
excess of iron and zinc exists, phosphorous
becomes unavailable. If you are growing in soil,
mix a complete fertilizer that contains phosphorus into the growing medium before planting.
Fertigate with an inorganic, complete hydroponic fertilizer that contains phosphorus. Mix in the
organic nutrients-bat guano, steamed bone
meal, natural phosphates, or barnyard
manure-to add phosphorus to soil. Always use
finely ground organic components that are
readily available to the plants.
Toxic signs of phosphorus may take several
weeks to surface, especially if excesses are
buffered by a stable pH. Marijuana uses a lot of
phosphorus throughout its life cycle, and many
varieties tolerate high levels. Excessive phosphorus interferes with calcium, copper, iron,
magnesium, and zinc stability and uptake. Toxic
symptoms of phosphorus manifest as a deficiency of zinc, iron, magnesium, calcium and
copper; zinc is the most common.
Treat toxicity by flushing the growing medium
of affected plants with a very mild and complete

fertilizer. Severe problems require more water to
be flushed through the growing medium. Flush
a minimum of three times the volume of water
for the volume of the growing medium.

Potassium (K) - mobile
Practical Information: Potassium is used at all
stages of growth. Soils with a high level of
potassium increase a plant's resistance to bacteria and mold.
Technical information: Potassium helps combine sugars, starches, and carbohydrates, which
is essential to their production and movement.
It also is essential to growth by cell division. It
increases the chlorophyll in the foliage and
helps to regulate the stomata openings so
plants make better use of the light and air.
Potassium is essential in the accumulation and
translocation of carbohydrates. It is necessary to
make the proteins that augment the oil content
and improve the flavor in cannabis plants. It also
encourages strong root growth and is associated with disease resistance and water intake. The
porash form of potassium oxide is (K10).
Deficiency Potassium-starved plants initially
appear healthy. Deficient plants are susceptible
to disease. Symptoms include the following:
older leaves (first tips and margins, followed by
whole leaves) develop spots, turn dark yellow,
and die. Stems often become weak and sometimes brittle. Potassium is usually present in the
soil, but it is locked in by high salinity. First, leach
the toxic salt out of the soil and then apply a
complete N-P·K fertilizer. Potassium deficiency
causes the internal temperature of the foliage to
climb and the protein cells to burn or degrade.
Evaporation is normally highest on leaf edges,
and that's where the burning takes place.
The progression of the deficiency symptoms
at a glance:
Plants appear healthy with dark green foliage.
The leaves lose their luster.
Branching may increase, but the branches are
weak and scrawny.
Leaf margins turn grey and progress to a rustybrown color, and then curl up and dry.
Yellowing of the older leaves is accompanied
by rust-colored blotches.

and slows the absorption of magnesium, manganese, and sometimes zinc and iron. Look for
signs of toxic-potassium buildup when symp·

of affected plants with a very mild and complete

The secondary nutrienl'S-magnesium, calcium,
and sulfur- are also used by the plants in large
amounts. Rapid-growing indoor marijuana
crops are able to process more secondary nutrients than most general-purpose fertilizers are
able. to supply. Many growers opt to use high
quality two- and three-part hydroponic fertilizers
to supply all necessary secondary and trace elements. But be careful, these three nutrients may
be present in high levels in the ground water. It
is important to consider these values when
adding nutrient supplements. If growing in a soil
or soilless mix with a pH below 7 such as PeatLite, incorporating one cup of fine (flour)
dolomite lime per gallon of medium ensures
adequate supplies of calcium and magnesium.
Macronutrients are the elements that the
plants use most. The fertilizers usually show
nitrogen (N), potassium (P), phosphorous (K)
as (N-P-K) percentages in big numbers on the
front of the package. They are always listed in
the same N-P-K order. These nutrients must
always be in an available form to supply marijuana with the building blocks for rapid growth.

Magnesium (Mg) - mobile
Practical Information: Marijuana uses a lot of
magnesium, and deficiencies are common,
especially in acidic (pH below 7) soils. Adding
dolomite lime to acidic potting soils before
planting will stabilize the pH, plus it will add
magnesium and calcium to the soil. Add Epsom
salts with each watering to correct magnesium
deficiencies, if no dolomite was added when
planting. Use Epsom salts designed specifically
for plants rather than the supermarket-type.
Technical Information: Magnesium is found
as a central atom in every chlorophyll molecule,
and it is essential to the absorption of lightenergy. It aids in the utilization of nutrients.
Magnesium helps enzymes make carbohydrates
and sugars that are later transformed into flowers. It also neutralizes the soil acids and toxic
compounds produced by the plant.
Defici ency: Magnesium deficiency is common

indoors. The lower leaves, and later the middle
leaves, develop yellow patches between dark,
green veins. Rusty-brown spots appear on the
leaf margins, tips, and between the veins, as the
deficiency progresses. The brownish leaf tips
usually curl upward before dying. The entire
plant could discolor in a few weeks, and if
severe, turn a yellow-whitish tinge before browning and dying. A minor deficiency will cause little
or no problem with growth. However, minor
deficiencies escalate and cause a diminished
harvest as flowering progresses. Most often,
magnesium is in the soil but is unavailable to the
plant because the root environment is too wet
and cold or acidic and cold. Magnesium is also
bound in the soil if
there is an excess of
potassium, ammonia
(nitrogen), and calcium (carbonate). Small
root systems are also
unable to take in
enough magnesium to
supply heavy demand.

Rust-brown spots and yellowing progress,

Younger leaves develop rust-colored spots and

The leaves dry and die in extreme cases.
Treat deficiency by watering with two teaspoons of Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate) per
gallon of water. For fast results, spray the foliage
with a 2 percent solution of Epsom salts. If the
deficiency progresses to the top of the plant, it
will turn green there first. In four to six days, it
will start moving down the plant, turning lower
leaves progressively more green. Continue a
regular watering schedule with Epsom salts until
the symptoms totally disappear. Adding Epsom
salts regularly is not necessary when the fertilizer contains available magnesium. Use a foliar
spray of Epsom salts for a fast cure. Another
option is to apply magnesium sulfate monohydrate in place of Epsom salts. Add fine dolomite
lime to soil and soilless mix to add a consistent
supply of both calcium and magnesium over the
long term. Always use the finest dolomite available.
Control the room and root-zone temperatures,
humidity, pH, and EC of the nutrient solution.
Keep root zone and nutrient solution at 70 to
75°F (21-24°C). Keep ambient air temperature
at 75°F (21°C) day and 65°F (l 8°C) night. Use a
complete fertilizer with an adequate amount of
magnesium. Keep the soil pH above 6.5, the
hydroponic pH above 5.5, and reduce high EC
for a week.
The extra magnesium in the soil is generally
not harmful, but it can inhibit calcium uptake.
Signs of excess magnesium are described
below.
Toxicity: Magnesium toxicity is rare and difficult to discern with the naked eye. If extremely
toxic, the magnesium develops a conflict with
other fertilizer ions, usually calcium, especially in
hydroponic nutrient solutions. The toxic buildup

Calcium (Ca) - immobile

Practical Information: Cannabis requires
nearly as much calcium as other macronutrients.
Avert deficiencies in the soil and in most soilless
mixes by adding fine dolomite lime or using
soluble-hydroponic fertilizers containing adequate calcium.
Technical Information: Calcium is fundamental to cell manufacturing and growth. Calcium is
necessary to preserve membrane permeability
and cell integrity, which ensures proper flow of
nitrogen and sugars. It stimulates enzymes that
help build strong cell and root walls. Cannabis
must have some calcium at the growing tip of
each root.
Deficiency of calcium is somewhat uncommon indoors, but not uncommon in fiber hemp.
Frequently, plants can process more calcium
than is available. It also washes out of the leaves
that are sprayed with water. Deficiency signs
may be difficult to detect. They start with weak
stems, very dark green 'foliage, and exceptionally slow growth. Young leaves are affected, and
they show the signs first. Severe calcium deficiency causes new, growing shoots to develop
yellowish to purple hues and to disfigure before
shriveling up and dying; bud development is
inhibited, the plants are stunted, and harvest is
diminished. Growing tips could show signs of
calcium deficiency if the humidity is maxed out.
At 100 percent humidity, the stomata close,
which stops the transpiration to protect the
plant. The calcium that is transported by transpiration becomes immobile.
Treat deficiencies by dissolving one-half teaspoon of hydrated lime per gallon of water.
Water the deficient plants with calcium-dosed
water as long as the symptoms persist. Or use a
complete hydroponic nutrient that contains adequate calcium. Keep the pH of the growing
medium stable.
Progression of deficiency symptoms at a
glance:
Slow growth and young leaves turn very dark
green.
New growing shoots discolor.
New shoots contort, shrivel, and die.
Bud development slows dramatically.
Toxicity is difficult to see in the foliage. It caus-

es wilting. Toxic levels also exacerbate deficiencies of potassium, magnesium, manganese, and
iron. The nutrients become unavailable, even
though they are present. If excessive amounts of
soluble calcium are applied early in life, it can
also stunt the growth. If growing hydroponically,
an excess of calcium will precipitate with sulfur
in the solution, which causes the nutrient solution to suspend in the water and to aggregate
into clumps causing the water to become
cloudy (flocculate). Once the calcium and sulfur
combine, they form a residue (gypsum

Practical Information: Many fertilizers contain
some form of sulfur, and for this reason, sulfur is
seldom defici ent. Growers avoid elemental
(pure) sulfur in favor of sulfur compounds such
as magnesium sulfate. The nutrients combined
with sulfur mix better in water.
Technical Information: Sulfur is an essential
building block of many hormones and vitamins,
including vitamin B1• Sulfur is also an indispensable element in many plant cells and seeds.
The sulfate form of sulfur buffers the water pH.
Virtually all ground, river, and lake water contains sulfate. Sulfate is involved in protein synthesis and is part of the amino acid, cystine, and
thiamine, which are the building blocks of proteins. Sulfur is essential in the formation of oils
and flavors, as well as for respiration and the
synthesis and breakdown of fatty acids.
Hydroponic fertilizers separate sulfur from calcium in an "A" container and a "B" container. If
combined in a concentrated form, sulfur and
calcium will form crude, insoluble gypsum (calcium sulfate) and settle as residue to the bottom of the tank.
Deficiency: Young leaves turn lime-green to
yellowish. As shortage progresses, leaves yellow
interveinally and lack succulence. Veins remain
green, and leaf stems and petioles turn purple.
Leaf tips can burn, darken, and hook downward.
According to literature, youngest leaves should
yellow first. But Mauk from Canna Coco in the
Netherlands, who has conducted detailed scientific experiments with nutrients, says, "We have

more leaves to develop purple leaf stems and yellow leaves.
Treat deficiency by fertilizing with a hydroponic fertilizer that contains sulfur. Lower the pH to
5.5 to 6. Add inorganic sulfur to a fertilizer that
contains magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts).
Organic sources of sulfur include mushroom
composts and most animal manures. Make sure
to apply only well-rotted manures to avoid burning the roots.
Toxicity: An excess of sulfur in the soil causes
no problems if the EC is relatively low. At a high
EC, the plants tend to take up more available
sulfur which blocks uptake of other nutrients.
Excess sulfur symptoms include overall smaller
plant development and uniformly smaller, darkgreen foliage. Leaf tips and margins could discolor and burn when severe.
Treat toxicity by flushing the growing medium

of affected plants wi th a very mild and complete
fertilizer. Check the pH of the drainage solution.
Correct the input pH to 6. Severe problems
require more water to be flushed through the
growing medium. Flush a minimum of three
times the volume of water for the volume of the
growing medium.

Micronutrients
Micronutrients, also called trace elements or
trace nutrients, are essential to chlorophyll formation and must be present in minute
amounts. They function mainly as catalysts to
the plant's process and utilization of other elements. For best results, and to ensure a complete range of trace elements is available, use
fertilizers designed for hydroponics. High quality
hydroponic fertilizers use food-grade ingredients that are completely soluble and leave no
residues. If using an inexpensive fertilizer that
does not list a specific analysis for each trace
element on the label, it's a good idea to add soluble trace elements in a chelated form.
Chelated micronutrients are available in powdered and liquid form. Add and thoroughly mix
micronutrients into the growing medium before
planting. Micronutrients are often impregnated
in commercial potting soils and soilless mixes.
Check the ingredients on the bag to ensure that
the trace elements were added to the mix. Trace

MICRONUTRIENTS
Zinc, iron, and manganese are the
three most common micronutrients
found deficient. Deficiencies of these
three micronutrients plague many
more grow rooms than I had imagined.
Often deficiencies of all three occur
concurrently, especially when the soil
or water pH is above 6.5. Deficiencies
are most common in arid climatesSpain, the Southwestern United States,
Australia, etc.- with alkaline soil and
water. All three have the same initial
symptom of deficiency: interveinal
chlorosis of young leaves. It is often difficult to distinguish which elementzinc, iron, or manganese- is deficient,
and all three could be deficient. This is
why treating the problem should
include adding a chelated dose of all
three nutrients.
elements are necessary in minute amounts but
can easily reach toxic levels. Always follow the
manufacturer's instructions to the letter when
applying micronutrients, because they are easy
to over apply.

Zinc (Zn)- mobile

A chelate (Greek for claw) is an organic molecule that forms a claw-like bond with free
electrically charged metal particles. This property keeps metal ions such as zinc, iron, and
manganese, etc., soluble in water, and the chelated metal's reactions with other materials is
suppressed. Roots take in the chelated metals in a stable, soluble form that is used immediately.
Natural chelates such as humic acid and citric acid can be added to organic soil mixes.
Roots and bacteria also exude natural chelates to promote the uptake of metallic elements.
Man-made chelates are designed for use in different situations. DTPA is most effective in a
pH below 6.5, EDDHA is effective up to a pH of 8, and EDTA chelate is slow to cause leaf
burn.
Chelates decompose rapidly in low levels of ultraviolet (UV) light including light produced
by HID bulbs and sunlight. Keep chelates out of the light to protect them from rapid decomposition.
Chelate - combining nutrients in an atomic ring that is easy for plants to absorb.

Practical Information: Zinc is the most common micronutrient found deficient in arid climates and alkaline soils.
Technical Information: Zinc works with manganese and magnesium to promote the same
enzyme functions. Zinc cooperates with other
elements to help form chlorophyll as well as
prevent its demise. It is an essential catalyst for
most plants' enzymes and auxins, and it is crucial for stern growth. Zinc plays a vital part in
sugar and protein production. It is fairly common to find zinc-deficient cannabis. Deficiencies
are most common in soils with a pH of 7 or
more.
Deficiency: Zinc is the most common
micronutrient found deficient. First, younger

Treat zinc-deficient plants by flushing the

add a quality-brand hydroponic micronutrient
mix containing chelated trace elements.
Toxicity: Zinc is extremely toxic in excess.
Severely toxic plants die quickly. Excess zinc
interferes with the iron's ability to function properly and causes an iron deficiency.

Manganese (Mn) - immobile
Practical Information: Manganese deficiency
is relatively common indoors.
Technical Information: Manganese is
engaged in the oxidation-reduction process
associated with the photosynthetic electron
transport. This element activates many enzymes
and plays a fundamental part in the chloroplast
membrane system. Manganese assists nitrogen
utilization along with iron in chlorophyll production.
Deficiency: Young leaves show symptoms
first. They become yellow between veins (interveinal chlorosis), and the veins remain green.
Symptoms spread from younger to older leaves
as the deficiency progresses. Necrotic (dead)
spots develop on severely affected leaves which
become pale and fall off; overall plant growth is
stunted, and maturation may be prolonged.

chlorophyll production, iron is necessary for
nitrate and sulfate reduction and assimilation.
Iron colors the earth from brown to red, according to concentration. Plants have a difficult time
absorbing iron. Acidic soils normally contain
adequate iron for cannabis growth.
Deficiency: Iron deficiencies are common
when the pH is above 6.5 and uncommon
when the pH is below 6.5. Symptoms may
appear during rapid growth or stressful times
and disappear by themselves. Young leaves are
unable to draw immobile iron from older leaves,
even though it is present in the soil. The first

Sterilizing the nutrient solution with UV light
causes iron to precipitate. Leaves should green

hydroponic nutrients contain iron, and deficiencies are seldom a problem. Organic sources of
iron, as well as chelates, include cow, horse, and
chicken manure. Use only well-rotted manures
to avoid burning plants.
Toxicity: Excess of iron is rare. High levels of
iron do not damage cannabis, but it can interfere with phosphorus uptake. An excess of iron
causes the leaves to turn bronze accompanied
by small, dark brown leaf spots. If iron chelate is
over applied, it will kill the plant in a few days.

mushy- perfect hosts for rot and disease.
Deficient leaves become thick, distorted, and
wilted with chlorotic and necrotic spotting.
Treat boron-deficient plants with one teaspoon of boric acid per gallon of water. You can
apply this solution as a soil drench to be taken
up by the roots, or apply hydroponic micronutrients containing boron. Hydroponic gardeners
should keep boron dosage below 20 parts per
million (ppm), because boron quickly becomes
toxic if it is concentrated in the solution.
Toxicity: Leaf tips yellow first, and as the toxic
conditions progress, leaf margins become
necrotic toward the center of the leaf. After the
leaves yellow, they fall off. Avoid using excessive
amounts of boric acid-based insecticides.

Chlorine (Chloride) (CI) - immobile
The following group of micronutrient's is sel·
dom found deficient. Avoid deficiencies by using
a high-quality hydroponic fertilizer that contains
chelated micronutrients.

Boron (B) - immobile
Practical Information: Usually causes no
problems, but boron must be available during
the entire life of a plant.
Technical Information: Boron deficiencies seldom occur indoors. Boron is still somewhat of a
biochemical mystery. We know that boron helps
with calcium uptake and numerous plant functions. Scientists have collected evidence to suggest boron helps with synthesis, a base for the
formation of nucleic acid (RNA uracil) formation. Strong evidence.also supports boron's role
in cell division, differentiation, maturation, and
respiration as well as a link to pollen germination.
Deficiency: Stem tip and root tip grow abnormally. Root tips often swell, discolor, and stop
elongating. Growing shoots look burned and
may be confused with a burn from being too
close to the HID light. First leaves thicken and
become brittle, top shoots contort and/or turn
dark, which is later followed by progressively
lower-growing shoots. When severe, growing
tips die, and leaf margins discolor and die back
in places. Necrotic spots develop between leaf
veins. Root steles (insides) often become

Practical Information: Chloride is found in
many municipal water systems. Cannabis tolerates low levels of chlorine. It is usually not a
component of fertilizers and is almost never
deficient in gardens that grow cannabis.
Technical Information: Chlorine, in the form
of chloride, is fundamental to photosynthesis
and cell division in the roots and the foliage. It
also increases osmotic pressure in the cells,
which open and close the stomata to regulate
moisture flow within the plant tissue.
Deficiency: It is uncommon to be deficient.
Young leaves pale and wilt, and roots become
stubby. As the deficiency progresses, leaves
become chlorotic and develop a characteristic
bronze color. The roots develop thick tips and
become stunted. NOTE: Both severe deficiency
and excess of chloride have the same symptoms: bronze-colored leaves.
Treat chlorine defi ciencies by adding chlorinated water.
Toxicity: Young leaves develop burned leaf
tips and margins. Very young seedlings and
clones are the most susceptible to damage.
Later, the symptoms progress throughout the
plant. Characteristic yellowish-bronze leaves are
smaller and slower to develop.
Treat toxic signs of chlorine by letting heavily
chlorinated water sit out overnight, stirring occasionally. Chlorine will volatize and disappear
into the atmosphere. Use this water to mix the
nutrient solution or to irrigate the garden.

Cobalt (Co) - immobile
Practical Information: This nutrient is seldom
mentioned as necessary for plant growth, and
most fertilizer labels do not include cobalt.
Cobalt is virtually never deficient in indoor
cannabis gardens.
Technical Information: Cobalt is necessary for
countless beneficial bacteria to grow and flourish. It is also vital for nitrogen absorption.
Scientific evidence suggests this element is
linked to enzymes needed to form aromatic
compounds.
Deficiency: When deficient, the problems with
nitrogen availability occur.

Copper (Cu) - immobile
Practical Information: Copper is concentrated
in the roots. It is also used as a fungicide.
Technical Information: Copper is a component of numerous enzymes and proteins.
Necessary in minute amounts, copper helps
with carbohydrate metabolism, nitrogen fixation, and the process of oxygen reduction. It also
helps with the making of proteins and sugars.
Deficiency: Copper deficiencies are not rare.
Young leaves and growing shoots wilt, leaf tips
and margins develop necrosis and turn a dark,
copper-gray. Occasionally, an entire copper-deficient plant wilts, drooping even when adequately watered. Growth is slow and the yield
decreases. A small deficiency can cause new
shoots to die back.
Treat copper deficiency by applying a copperbased fungicide such as copper sulfate. Do not
apply if the temperature is above 75°F (24°C) to
avoid burning the foliage. Apply a complete
hydroponic nutrient that contains copper.
Cannabis plants seldom develop a copper defi.
c1ency.
Toxicity: Copper, although essential, is
extremely toxic to the plant even in minor
excess. Toxic levels slow the overall plant
growth. As the toxic level climbs, symptoms
include interveinal iron chlorosis (deficiency)
and stunted growth. Fewer branches grow, and
the roots become dark, thicl<, and slow growing.
Toxic conditions accelerate quickly in acidic soils.
Hydroponic gardeners must carefully monitor
their solution to avoid copper excess.

Treat toxicity: Flush the soil or the growing
medium to help expel the excess copper. Do not
use copper-based fungicides.

Molybdenum (Mb) - immobile
Practical Information: Molybdenum is seldom deficient.
Technical Information: Molybdenum is a part
of two major enzyme systems that convert
nitrate to ammonium. This essential element is
used by cannabis in very small quantities. It is
most active in roots and seeds.
Deficiency: This micronutrient is almost never
found deficient in cannabis. Deficiency promotes nitrogen shortage. First, the older and
middle-aged leaves yellow, and some develop
interveinal chlorosis; then the leaves continue to
yellow and develop cupped or rolled-up margins as the deficiency progresses. Acute symptoms cause the leaves to become severely twisted, die, and drop. Overall growth is stunted.
Deficiencies are worst in acidic soils.
Toxicity: Excess is uncommon in marijuana
gardens. An excess of molybdenum causes a
deficiency of copper and iron.

Silicon - (Si)
Practical Information: Silicon is readily available in most soils, water, and as far as I know, it
does not cause cannabis any complications due
to deficiencies or excesses.
Technical Information: Silicon is absorbed by
the plants as silicic acid. Silicon assists in keeping iron and manganese levels consistent. It is
found mainly in the epidermal cell walls where
it collects in the form of hydrated amorphous silica. It also accumulates in the walls of other
cells. Adequate and soluble silicon guarantees
stronger cell walls that resist pest attacks and
increase heat and drought tolerance.
Deficiency: A lack of silicon has been proven
to decrease yields of some .fruits and cause new
leaves to deform.
Excess: Never heard of a problem.
NOTE: Pests and diseases have a difficult time
penetrating the plants that are sprayed with a
silicon-based repellent/insecticide.

Fluoride - (F)
Some water systems are
abundant wi th fluoride. If
concentrated, fluoride can
become toxic. I have yet to
see fluoride toxicity or deficiency cause problems in an
indoor grow room.

*

Now we come to the confusing part about the
guaranteed analysis of commercial fertilizer
mixes. Federal and state laws require nutrient
concentrations to appear prominently on the
face of the fertilizer packages, even though the
accuracy of the values is dubious.
Do you think the N-P-K numbers on the label
give the percentages of nitrogen, phosphorous,
and potassium? Well, yes and no. The scale
measures nutrients with different scales.
Nitrogen is listed as total combined elemental.
Most hydroponic fertilizers break nitrogen into
slow-acting nitrate (NO J) and ammonium
(NH 4 ). Phosphoric anhydride (P20$) is listed as
the form of phosphorus, but this figure understates phosphorus content by 44 percent. It gets
worse! The balance (56 percent) of the phosphorus molecule is comprised of oxygen.
Twenty percent P20 5 is 8.8 percent actual phosphorous. Potassium (K) is listed in the potash
form of potassium oxide (K20) of which 83 percent of the stated value is actually elemental
potassium.
The rest of the mineral nutrients are listed in
their elemental form that represents the actual
content. Most often, the mineral elements used
in the fertili zer formulas are listed in chemical
compounds on the label. Look at the fertilizer
labels to ensure that the elements, especially
trace elements, are chelated and readily available for root absorption. Also, be careful about
having too much sodium in your water/nutrient
solution. The sodium will block potassium and
several other nutrients, causing deficiencies and
slow growth.
Nutrients in the United States are measured in
parts-per-million (ppm), even though they are
expressed as a percentage concentration on the
label. The ppm scale is simple and finite-almost.
The basics are simple: one part per million is
one part of 1,000,000, so divide by one million
to find parts per million. To convert percentages
into ppm, multiply by 10,000 and move the decimal four (4) spaces to the right. For example: 2
percent equals 20,000 ppm. For more information on ppm and Electrical Conductivity, see
Chapter Twelve, "Hydroponic Gardening:·
Fertilizers are either water-soluble or partially
soluble (gradual-release). Both soluble and

gradual-release fertilizers can be organic or
chemical.
These are the suggested soluble-salts fertilizer
recommendations for indoor cannabis cultivation. n1e values are expressed in parts per million.

Chemical Fertilizers
The diversity of hydroponic fertilizers is amazing. Local shop owners know which ones work
best in the local climate and water. Local storeowners know a lot about the local water and the
growers' needs. They are in a perfect position to
develop their own nutrient solution or adapt
one that works well with their water. A few manufacturers do not do their homework and make
bad nutrients. Most manufacturers are conscious and manufacture excellent fertilizers. As
always, read the entire fertilizer label and follow
the directions.
Soluble-chemical fertilizers are an excellent
choice for indoor container cultivation. Soluble
fertilizers dissolve in water and are easy to control, and they can be easily added or washed
(leached) out of the growing medium. Control
the exacting amounts of nutrients available to
the plants in an available form with water-soluble fertilizers. The soluble fertilizer may be
applied in a water solution onto the soil. In general, high-quality hydroponic fertilizers that use
completely soluble food-grade nutrients are the
best value. Avoid low-quality fertilizers that do
not list all necessary micronutrients on the label.
Chemical granular fertilizers work well but can
easily be over-applied, creating toxic soil. They
are almost impossible to leach out fast enough
to save the plant.
Osmocote'" chemical fertilizers are time
release and are used by many nurseries because
they are easy to apply and only require one
application every few months. Using this type of
fertilizer may be convenient, but exacting control is lost. They are best suited for ornamental,
containerized plants where labor costs and uniform growth are the main concerns.

Several common chemical fertilizers from the hydroponic industry.

Outdoor organic gardens are easy to implement and maintain. Using compost tea,
manures, bulky compost, and other big, smelly
things is much easier outdoors.

Organic Teas
Compost teas not only contain soluble organic nutrients diluted in water, but they support a
potent elixir that is loaded with beneficial
microbes that fight off pests and diseases. For
example, a quarter teaspoon of a well-made
compost tea holds more than a billion bacteria
and at least 15 feet of fungi strands! A good
compost tea also contains thousands of different species of protozoa, nematodes, and mycorrhizal fungi.
Disease-causing organisms are unable to compete with beneficial bacteria and fungi.
Beneficial bacteria also work to break down
plant residues and toxic materials, plus they
improve soil structure and water-holding ability.
The best teas are made from well-rotted cornpost, because it contains a complex collection of
microbes and nutrients. Just make sure the
compost pile has heated to 135°F (52°C) for at
least 3 days to ensure it is free of most diseases.
You can usually buy quality compost at the local
nursery. If using manure, make sure it has been
well-composted.
You can brew the tea in a 5-gallon ( 19 L) bucket. Add about a gallon (3.8 L) of rotted compost
or manure to 4 gallons (15 L) of water. Stir well,
and let the mix sit for several days. You can also
put sifted compost into a nylon stocking, and

submerge it in the bucket. To stir, simply bounce
the stocking around in the water. Stir the mixture gently several times a day to integrate oxygen and remove microbes from the compost.
Adequate oxygen keeps the brew fresh. If it
starts to smell foul, anaerobic bacteria are present. Add fresh water and stir more often. The
good aerobic bacteria re-establish as soon as
they have an ample supply of oxygen.

Organic Nutrients Chart
Alfalfa meal has 2.5 percent nitrogen, 5 percent phosphorus, and about 2 percent
potash. Outdoor growers use pelletized animal feed as a slow-release fertilizer.
Blood and bone meal are wonderful organic
fertilizers, but could transport Mad Cow
Disease and other maladies. I can't recorn·
mend these with a clear conscience.
Blood (dried or meal) is collected at slaughter·
houses, dried, and ground into a powder or
meal. It's packed with fast-acting soluble
nitrogen (12 to 15 percent by weight), about
1.2 percent phosphorus, and under one·
percent potash. Apply carefully because it's
easy to burn foliage. We advise avoiding use
of any dried blood or blood meal that could
carry Mad Cow Disease.
Bone meal is rich in phosphorus and nitrogen.
The age and type of bone determine the
nutrient content of this pulverized slaughter·
house product. Older bones have higher

phosphorus content than young bones. Use
bone meal in conjunction with other organic fertilizers for best results. Its lime content
helps reduce soil acidity and acts fast in wellaerated soil. We advise avoiding any bone
meal that could carry Mad Cow Disease.
Raw, unsteamed bone meal contains 2 to 4
percent nitrogen and 15 to 25 percent phosphorus. Fatty acids in raw bone meal retard
decomposition. We advise avoiding any
bone meal that could carry Mad Cow
Disease.
Steamed or cooked bone meal is made from
fresh animal bones that have been boiled or
steamed under pressure to render out fats.
The pressure treatment causes a little nitrogen loss and an increase in phosphorus.
Steamed bones are·easier to grind into a fine
powder, and the process helps nutrients
become available sooner. It contains up to
30 percent phosphorus and about 1.5 percent nitmgen. The finer the bone meal is
ground, the faster it becomes available.
Cottonseed meal is the leftover by-product of
oil extraction. According to the manufacturer,
virtually all chemical residues from commercial cotton production are dissolved in the oil
and not found in the meal. This acidic fertilizer contains about 7 percent nitrogen, 2.5
percent phosphorus, and 1.5 percent
potash. It should be combined with
steamed bone meal and seaweed to form a
balanced fertilizer blend.
Chicken manure is rich in available nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements.
Indoor growers most often prefer to purchase dry, composted chicken manure in a
bag. Use it as a top dressing or mix it with
the soil before planting. Often .chicken
manure collected from farms is packed with
feathers, which contain as much as 17 percent nitrogen; this is an added bonus. The
average nutrient content of wet chicken
manure is as follows: N - 1.5%, P - 1.5%, K
- 0.5%; and dry chicken manure, N - 4%, P
- 4%, K - 1.5%. Both have a full range of
trace elements.
Coffee grounds are acidic and encourage

acetic bacteria in the soil. Drip-coffee
grounds are the richest, and contain about 2
percent nitrogen and traces of other nutrients. Add this to the compost pile or scatter
and cultivate it in. Use it as topdressing, but
in moderation, because it is very acidic.
Compost tea is used by many organic gardeners as the only source of fertilizer. Comfrey is
packed with nutrients, and many gardeners
grow it just to make compost tea.
Cow manure is sold as steer manure, but it is
often collected from dairy herds. Gardeners
have used cow manure for centuries, and
this has led to the belief that it is a good fertilizer as well as a soil amendment Steer
manure is most valuable as mulch and a soil
amendment It holds water well and maintains fertility for a long time. The nutrient
value is low, and it should not be relied upon
for the main source of nitrogen. The average
nutrient content of cow manure is N - 0.6%,
P - 0.3%, I< - 0.30/o, and a full range of trace
elements. Apply at the rate of 25 to 30
pounds per square yard.
Diatomaceous earth, the fossilized skeletal
remains of fresh and saltwater diatoms, contains a full range of trace elements, and it is
a good insecticide. Apply it to the soil when
cultivating or as a topdressing.
Dolomite lime adjusts and balances the pH
and makes phosphates more available.
Generally applied to sweeten or de-acidify
the soil. It consists of calcium and magnesium, and is sometimes listed as a primary
nutrient, though it is generally referred to as
a secondary nutrient.
Feathers and feather meal contain from 12 to
15 percent nitrogen that is released slowly.
Feathers included in barnyard chicken
manure or obtained from slaughterhouses
are an excellent addition to the compost pile
or as a fertilizer. Feathers are steamed under
pressure, dried, and ground into a powdery
feather meal. Feather meal contains slowrelease nitrogen of about 12.5 percent.
Fish meal is made from dried 'fish ground into
a meal. It is rich in nitrogen (about 8 percent) and contains around 7 percent phos-

phoric acid and many trace elements. It has
an unpleasant odor, causing it to be avoided
by indoor growers. It is a great compost activator. Apply it to the soil as a fast-acting topdressing. To help control odor, cultivate it
into the soil or cover it with mulch after
applying. Always store it in an air-tight container, so it will not attract cats, dogs, or flies.
Fish meal and fish emulsion can contain up
to 10 percent nitrogen. The liquid generally
contains less nitrogen than the meal. Even
when deodorized, the liquid form has an
unpleasant odor.
Fish emulsion, an inexpensive soluble liquid,
is high in organic nitrogen, trace elements,
and some phosphorus and potassium. This
natural fertilizer is difficult to over-apply, and
it is immediately available to the plants. Even
deodorized fish emulsion smells like dead
fish. Inorganic potash is added to the fish
emulsion by some manufacturers and is

Goat manure is much like horse manure but
more potent. Compost this manure and
treat it as you would horse manure.
Granite dust or granite stone meal contains
up to 5 percent potash and several trace elements. Releasing nutrients slowly over several years, granite dust is an inexpensive
source of potash and does not affect soil pH.
Not recommended indoors because it is too
slow acting.
Greensand (glaucomite) is an iron-potassium
silicate that gives the minerals in which it
occurs a green tint. It is mined from ancient
New Jersey-seabed deposits of shells and
organic material rich in iron, phosphorus,
potash (5 to 7 percent), and numerous
micronutrients. Some organic gardeners do
not use Greensand because it is such a limited resource. Greensand slowly releases its
treasures in about four years. This is too slow
acting for indoor gardens.
Guano (bat) consists of the droppings and
remains of bats. It is rich in soluble nitrogen,
phosphorus, and trace elements. The limited
supply of this fertilizer- known as the soluble
organic super bloom- makes it somewhat

and make an excellent flowering fertilizer. Bat
guano is usually powdery and is used any
time of year as top dressing or diluted in a
tea. Do not breathe the dust when handling
it, because it can cause nausea and irritation.
Guano (sea bird) is high in nitrogen and other
nutrients. The Humboldt Current, along the
coast of Peru and northern Chile, keeps the
rain from falling, and decomposition of the
guano is minimal. South American guano is
the world's best guano. The guano is

Gypsum (hydrated calcium sulfate) is used to
lower the soil pH, and it improves drainage
and aeration. It is also used to hold or slow
the rapid decomposition of nitrogen. This is
seldom used indoors.
Hoof and horn meal is an excellent source of
slow-release nitrogen. Fine-ground horn
meal makes nitrogen available quicker and
has few problems with fly maggots. Soil
bacteria must break it down before it is
available to the roots. Apply it two to three
weeks before planting. It remains in the soil
for six months or longer. Hoof and horn
meal contains from 6 to 15 percent nitrogen
and about 2 percent phosphoric acid. We
advise avoiding use of any dried blood or
A

bone meal that could carry Mad Cow
Disease.
Horse manure is readily available from horse
stables and racetracks. Use horse manure
that has straw or peat for bedding, since
wood shavings could be a source of plant
disease. Compost horse manure for two
months or longer before adding it to the
garden. The composting process kills weed
seeds, and it will make better use of the
nutrients. Straw bedding often uses up
much of the available nitrogen. Nutrient
content of horse manure is N - 0.6%, P 0.6%, I< - 0.4%, and a full range of trace elements.
Kelp is the Cedilla of trace minerals. Kelp
should be deep-green, fresh, and smell like
the ocean. Seaweed contains 60 to 70 trace
minerals that are already chelated (existing
in a form tliat's water soluble and mobile in
the soil). Check the label to ensure all elements are not cooked out. See Seaweed
below.
Oyster shells are ground and normally used
as a calcium source for poultry. They contain
up to 55 percent calcium and traces of
many other nutrients that release slowly.
Not practical to use indoors because they
break down too slowly.
Paper ash contains about 5 percent phosphorus and over 2 percent potash. It is an excellent water-soluble fertilizer, but do not apply
in large doses, because the pH is quite high.
Paper ash is also full of toxic inks.
Pigeon manure has a very high concentration
of nitrogen but is difficult to find. It can be
used in the same fashion as chicken
manure.
Rabbit manure is also excellent fertilizer but
can be c)ifficult to find in large quantities.
Use rabbit manure as you would chicken or
pigeon manure. According to John
McPartland, rabbit poop is the best. Bunnies
rule!
Potash rod< supplies up to 8 percent potassium and may contain many trace elements.
It releases too slowly to be practical indoors.
Rod< phosphate (hard) is a calcium or lime-

based phosphate rock that is finely ground
to the consistency of talcum powder. The
rock powder contains over 30 percent phosphate and a menagerie of trace elements,
but it is available very, very slowly.
Colloidal phosphate (powdered or soft phosphate) is a natural clay phosphate deposit
that contains just over 20 percent phosphorus (P20 $), calcium, and many trace elements. It yields only 2 percent phosphate by
weight the first few months.
Seaweed meal and/or kelp meal is harvested
from the ocean or picked up along the
beaches, cleansed of salty water, dried, and
ground into a powde1y meal. It is packed
with potassium (potash), numerous trace
elements, vitamins, amino acids, and plant
hormones. The nutrient content varies
according to the type of kelp and growing
conditions. Seaweed meal is easily assimilated by the plants, and contributes to soil
life, structure, and nitrogen fixation. It may
also help the plants resist many diseases
and withstand light frosts. Kelp meal also
eases transplant shock.
Seaweed (liquid) contains nitrogen, phosphorus, potash, all necessary trace elements in a
chelated form, as well as plant hormones.
Apply diluted solution to the soil for a quid<
cure of nutrient deficiencies. Liquid seaweed is also great for soaking seeds and,
dipping cuttings and bare roots before
planting.
Sheep manure is high in nutrients and makes
a wonderful tea. The average nutrient content is: N - 0.80/o, P - 0.5%, I< - 0.4%, and
a full range of trace elements. Sheep
manures contain little water and lots of air.
They heat up readily in a compost pile. Cow
and pig manures are cold because they hold
a lot of water and can be compacted easily,
squeezing out the air.
Shrimp & crab wastes contain relatively high
levels of phosphorus.
Sulfate of potash is normally produced
chemically by treating rock powders with
sulfuric acid, but one company, Great Salt
Lake Minerals and Chemicals Company,

produces a concentrated natural form. The
sulfate of potash is extracted from the Great
Salt Lake.
Swine manure has a high nutrient content but
is slower acting and welter (more anaerobic) than cow and horse manure. The average nutrient content of pig manure is: N 0.6%, P - 0.60fo, K - 0.40/o, and a full range
of trace elements.
Wood ashes (hardwood) supply up to 10 percent potash, and softwood ashes contain
about 5 percent. Potash leaches rapidly.
Collect the ash soon after burning, and store
in a dry place. Apply in a mix with other fertilizers at the rate of one-quarter cup per 3·
gallon pot. The potash washes out of the
wood ash quickly and can cause compacted, sticky soil. Avoid using alkaline wood
ashes in soil with a pH above 6.5.
Worm castings are excreted, digested humus
and other (decomposing) organic matter
that contain varying amounts of nitrogen as
well as many other elements. They are an
excellent source of non-burning soluble
nitrogen and an excellent soil amendment
that promotes fertility and structure. Mix
with the potting soil to form a rich, fertile
blend. Pure worm castings look like coarse
graphite powder and are heavy and dense.
Do not add more than 20 percent worm
castings to any mix. They are so heavy that
root growth can be impaired. Worm castings are ve1y popular and easier to obtain at
commercial nurseries.
Note: The nutrients in organic fertilizers may
vary greatly depending upon source, age,
erosion, climate, etc. For exact nutrient content, consult the vendor's specifications.
Dilute the tea at the rate of 1 to 5 with water.
Add more water to the same bucket, and continue to brew 3 to 4 more batches before starting a new batch.

Mixing Fertilizers
Always read the entire label, and follow the
directions. To mix, dissolve the powder and the
crystals into a little warm water, and make sure
it is totally dissolved before adding the balance
of the tepid water. This will ensure that the fertilizer and the water mix evenly. Liquid fertilizers
can be mixed directly with water.
Containers have very little growing medium in
which to hold the nutrients, and toxic salt
buildup may become a problem. Follow dosage
instructions to the letter. Adding too much fertilizer will not make the plants grow faster. It could
change the chemical balance of the soil, supply
too much of a nutrient, or lock in other nutrients
making them unavailable to the plant.

Fertilizer Application
Some varieties can take high doses of nutrients, and other strains grow best with a minimum of supplemental fertilizer. See the chart at

. --

To get an idea of which strains need a little
or a lot of fertilizer, I asked Alan from Sensi
Seeds and l-lenk from Dutch Passion their
thoughts. To learn the exact best way to fertilize specific strains, you may need to contact the company that sold you the seeds.
Start with an EC of 1.6 and build it up as
needed. The absolute maximum EC is 2.3.
Strains which require high doses of fertilizer:
All the lndicas, with the possible exception
of Hindu Kush (a landrace, with less vigor
and not as nutrient-hungry as hybrid
lndicas). In this case, 'more fertilizer means

left for recommendations on fertilizing a few
varieties. Many fertilizer programs are augmented with different additives that expedite nutrient
uptake.
Determine if the plants need to be fertilized:
make a visual inspection, take an N-P-K soil test,
or experiment on test plants. No matter which
method is used, remember, plants in small containers use available nutrients quickly and need
frequent fertilizing. while plants in large planters
have more soil, supply more nutrients, and can
go longer between fertilizing.
Visual Inspection - If the plants are growing
well and have deep-green, healthy leaves, they
are probably getting all necessary nutrients. The

turn pale green, it is time to fertilize. Do not confuse yellow leaves caused by a lack of light with
yellow leaves caused by a nutrient deficiency.
Taking an N-P-1< soil test will reveal exactly
how much of each major nutrient is available to
the plant. The test ki ts mix a soil sample with a
chemical. After the soil settles, a color reading is
taken from the liquid and matched to a color
chart. The appropriate percent of fertilizer is
then added. This method is exact but more
trouble than it is worth.
Experimenting on two or three test plants is
the best way to gain experience and develop
horticultural skills. Clones are perfect for this
type of experiment. Give the test plants some
fertilizer, and see if they green up and grow
faster. You should notice a change within three
to four days. If it is good for one, it should be
good for all.
Now, it has been determined that the plants
need fertilizer. How much? The answer is simple. Mix the fertilizer as per the instructions and
water as normal, or dilute the fertilizer and apply

it more often. Many liquid fertilizers are very
diluted already. Consider using more concentrated fertilizers whenever possible. Remember,
small plants use much less fertilizer than large
ones. Fertilize early in the day, so plants have all
day to absorb and process the fertilizer.
It is difficult to explain how often to apply all
fertilizers in a few sentences. We know that large
plants use more nutrients than small plants. The
more often the fertilizer is applied, the less concentrated it should be. Frequency of fertilization
and dosage are two of the most widely disagreed upon subjects among growers. Indoor
containerized marijuana can be pushed to
incredible lengths. Some strains will absorb
amazing amounts of fertilizer and grow well.
Lots of growers add as much as one tablespoon
per gallon of Peters'" (20-20-20) with each
watering. This works best with growing mediums that drain readily and are easy to leach.
Other growers use only rich, organic potting soil.
No supplemental fertilizer is applied until a
super bloom formula is needed for flowering.

This Grow Schedule by Hesi details the exact feeding schedule for a super successful crop.

Fertilizing plants in the ground is much easier
than fertilizing containerized plants. In the soil
outdoors, roots can find many nutrients, and fertilization is not as critical. There are several ways
to apply chemical fertilizer. You can top-dress a
garden bed by applying the fertilizer evenly over
the entire area. You can side-dress plants by

applying the fertilizer around the bases of the
plants. You can foliar-feed plants by spraying a
liquid fertilizer solution on the foliage. The
method you choose will depend upon the kind
of fertilizer, the needs of the plants, and the convenience of a chosen method.
When using synthetic fertilizers, it is extremely
important to read the label carefully, and follow
the directions. The initials "WSN" and ''WIN" that
you may see on the label stand for water-soluble nitrogen and water-insoluble nitrogen. WSN
dissolves readily, and it is considered a fastrelease nitrogen source. WIN does not dissolve
easily. It is often an organic form of nitrogen and
is considered a slow-release nitrogen source.
Use a siphon applicator-found at most nurs- Spray foliage from underneath so the spray is able to
penetrate the stomata located on the leaf's
eries- to mix soluble fertilizers with water. The
underside.
applicator is simply attached to the faucet with
the siphon submerged in the concentrated fertilizer solution with the hose attached to the
other end. Often, applicators are set at a ratio of
1 to 15. This means that for every 1 unit of liquid
concentrate fertilizer, 15 units of water will be
mixed with it. Sufficient water flow is necessary
for the suction to work properly. Misting nozzles
restrict this flow. When the water is turned on,
the fertilizer is siphoned into the system and
flows out the hose. The fertilizer is generally
applied with each watering, since a small percentage of fertilizer is metered in.
A garbage can with a garden-hose fitting
attached at the bottom that is set 3-4 feet (90120 em) off the floor will act as a gravity-flow
source for the fertilizer solution. The container is

Foliar
Feeding

Earth Juice Wetting Agent

Foliar feeding
means to spray
the nutrients or
bio-stimulants
onto
the
foliage to augment available
nutrients, vitamins,
hormones,
etc.
Timing is key to
achieving the

best coverage and absorption.
The waxy (cuticle) surface coating (cystolith
hairs and resin) on cannabis foliage makes
them very poor water absorbers. This barrier
wards off pest and disease attacks, but it also
slows the penetration of sprays.
Young leaves are more permeable than older
leaves. Nutrients and additives penetrate immature leaves faster than tougher, older leaves, and
they are easier to damage with strong sprays.
Foliar feed the cannabis plants only when specific deficiency symptoms manifest. Foliar feeding is a quick fix only and is easy to overdo. High
levels of nutrients in the foliage stop the roots
from taking in more; this is confusing for the
plant. Foliar sprays can accumulate and build up
in the foliage. Never spray more than once every
10 days, and keep the spray concentration to
less than 500 ppm or with an EC of less than 1.0.

Spreader-Sticl<ers
Smart growers use a surfactant, surface-active
substance (adjuvant), which enhances the effectiveness of foliar fertilization.
Spreaders (wetting agents) reduce the surface
tension of sprays and keep them from beading
up and rolling off the foliage. Big, bulbous drops
on the leaves mean you need to use a spreader. Flat drops that slide off the foliage mean
there is too much spreader. There are nonionic,
antionic, and cationic spreaders. The nonionic
spreaders that do not ionize in water are the
most common, and they do not react with most
pesticides. Antionic and cationic spreaders are
not used often.
Sticl<ers help the spray adhere to the leaf after
spraying, so it does not wash off when it rains or
when dew forms. Stickers not only increase
adhesion, they slow evaporation, and impart a
waterproof coating. Some stickers are spreaders,
too. Spreader-stickers allow the stomata on the
leaves to be penetrated.
Extender (stabilizing agents) protects applied
sprays against the UV radiation and heat that
degrade the sprays.
Liquid and powder soaps and detergents act
as surfactants, too. But, they are not nearly as
effective
as
horticultural
surfactants.
Biodegradable surfactants disappear the fastest.
Silicone surfactants are also mild insecticides
that work to impair pest functions.
Foliar spray concentration is cumulative.
Nutrients delivered via the foliage can cause a
buildup of salts in and around the leaves. This is
similar to the way the salts accumulate in the
soil.
Overfertilizing can become one of the biggest
problems for indoor growers. Too much fertilizer causes a buildup of the nutrients (salts) to
toxic levels, and it changes the soil chemistry.
When overfertilized, growth is rapid and lush
until the toxic levels are reached. At this point,
things become complicated.
Chance of overfertilization is greater in a small
amount of soil that can hold only a small
amount of nutrients. A large pot or planter can
safely hold much more soil and nutrients, but it
will take longer to flush if overdone. It is very
easy to add too much fertilizer to a small container. Large containers have good nutrient-

holding ability.
To treat severely overfertilized plants, leach the
soil with two gallons (8 L) of diluted nutrient
solution per gallon (4 L) of soil to wash out all
excess nutrients. The plant should start new
growth and look better in one week. If the prob_lem is severe and the leaves are curled, the so1l
may need to be leached several times. After the
plant appears to have leveled off to normal
growth, apply the diluted fertilizer solution.

Additives

ABSCISIC ACID (ABA)

Numerous additives or growth supplements
have hit the market over the last few years.
Generally, additives contain a cocktail of some
How to get the most out of your spray
1) Spray the bottom of the leaves. Spray
with a fine mist, and do not create droplets
on the leaves. Fine mist is electrically attracted by the foliage. Even young marijuana
plants have waxy hairs that impair liquid penetration.
2) Do not spray plants that are hot or when
the atmosphere is too dry. Spray in low light,
either before the lights go off or just as they
are coming on. If spraying in hot conditions,
first spray everything with plain water ~ntil

drop, before applying the real spray. Spray1ng
when the plant foliage is hot causes the spray
to crystallize on the surface, and it stops the
penetration. Spraying with water 10 min~tes
afterward often increases the penetration.
Mobile nutrients move freely within a plant.
Immobile nutrients move slowly, but once
deposited, they stay.
3) Apply mobile nutrients sparingly.
Immobile nutrients- sulfur, boron, copper,
iron, manganese, molybdenum, sulfur, and
zinc- often require two or three applications.
Calcium and boron are poor candidates for
foliar feeding because they translocat~ po.orly. But urea nitrogen applied as~ spray 111 ~1gh

works well for a base to the mix. Foliar feeding should turn the plant around in less than
a week. A second spray could be necessary at
week's end to ensure the cure sticks.
4) Boron, calcium, and iron move slowly
during flowering. A supplemental foliar dose
often speeds the growth when it slows. A
foliar spray of potassium can also help flo~­
ering, especially if the temperatures d1p
below 50°F (l0°C) or above 80°F (25°C).
5) Always spray new growth. The thin, waxy
layer and a few trichomes allow for good
penetration.
6) Measure the pH of the spray, and keep it
between 7 and 8.5. Potassium phosphate
(I< I-IPO ) becomes phytotoxic below pH 4
an~ abo~e 8.5. Stomata are signaled to close
within these pH ranges.
7) Use a surfactant with all sprays, and
apply these as per the instructions on the
label.
8) Add the proper amount of surfactant so
droplets do not form on the leaves. Once
formed, the droplets roll off the foliage, rendering it ineffective.
9) Stop the application before the droplets
form on the leaves. Make a test spray on a
mirror to ensure the spray is even and does
not form droplets that roll off the mirror.
1o) Spray with as fine a mist as possible to
minimize the size of the drop.

CELLULASE
Cellulase is a group of enzymes that act in the
root zone to break down organic material which
may rot and cause disease. Dead materials are
converted into glucose and returned to the substrate to be absorbed by the plant.
It can be used in water gardens to clean up
organic sludge.
COLCHICINE
Colchicine, an alkaloid, is prepared from the
dried corns and seeds of Colchicum autumnale,
the autumn crocus that also produces saffron.
The pale, yellow powder is water soluble.
Colchicine is a very dangerous, poisonous
compound that can be used to induce polyploid
mutations in cannabis. Clandestine breeders
started polyploid strains with colchicines, but
none of the strains showed any outstanding
characteristics, and cannabinoid levels were
unaffected.
Rather than explain how to use colchicine, I
will advise not to use it. It is very toxic and produces no change in potency. I do not know any
seed breeders that use it today.
CYTOKININS
Cytokinins are plant hormones derivative of
the purine adenine, the most common cytokinin
being Zeatin. They are synthesized in the roots
promoting cell division, chloroplast development, leaf development, and leaf senescence.
As an additive, cytokinins are most often derived
from the Seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum.
Added to the soil or sprayed on the plants,
cytokinins help the plant make more efficient
use of existing nutrients and water even in
drought conditions. The result is a healthier
plant and increased crop. Care must be given to
application of cytokinins along with other plant
hormones. Many commercial formulas contain
a hormone cocktail which includes hormones
like auxins and cytokinins that work against one
another.
ENZYMES
Enzymes are biological protein catalysts that
were first crystallized and isolated in 1926.
Enzymes accelerate the rates of reactions but do
not change themselves as a result of this action.

Without a spreader-sticker, the surfadant spwys often
bead up and roll off the folie~ge which makes them
ineffective.

Enzymes are added to fertilizers and growth
additives to accelerate biological activity and
speed nutrient uptake by roots.
Most enzymatic reactions happen within a
temperature range of 85-1 OS"F (30-40"C) and
each enzyme has an optimal range of pH for
activity. Most enzymes react with only a small
group of chemical compounds that are closely
related.
More than 1500 different enzymes have been
identified. Enzymes are grouped into six main
classes and many subclasses.
ETHYLENE GAS
Ethylene gas is a growth regulator hormone
that activates the aging and ripening of flowers
as well as preventing the development of buds
and retarding plant growth. It is most often used
by vegetable growers who force ripening of produce heading to market. In gardening, it may be
used to trigger flowering in plants.
FLOWER SAVER PLUS
Flower Saver Plus is a commercial product that
contains the Mycorrhizae fungus which enters
into a symbiotic relationship with the plant by
attaching itself to the root system. Mycorrhizal
threads enter into root tissue then grow out into

the substrate reaching more water and nutrients
than the plant could find on its own. In return,
the Mycorrhizae receive a protected environment and the sugars they need to thrive.
Use of Mycorrhizae improves root depth,
speeds maturation, and helps create resistance
to drought and disease. Larger more robust root
systems also improve the soil structure promoting better air and water movement.
Flower Saver Plus should be used at planting
time either as a root bath or worked into the top
two to four inches of soil. Look for a product that
has at least 50 to 100 spores per square foot.
Seek medical attention if ingested. Avoid
breathing the dust or spray, and keep out of
reach of children.

FULVIC ACID
Fulvic acid is a naturally occurring organic substance resulting from the microbial action on
decomposing plants. Absorbed into a plant, luivic acid will remain in the tissues and serve as a
powerful antioxidant as well as providing nutrients and acting as a bio-stimulant. Fulvic acid is
an excellent source of nutri tion for Mycorrhizae.
Growers can create fulvic acid by composting
or purchase the product from a retailer. It is available in forms suitable for hydroponics or soil
mediums.

GIBBERELLINS
Gibberellic Acid (GA) is a natural plant growth
hormone which acts with auxins to break dormancy, stimulate seed germination, and grow
long stems.
Gibberellic Acid can be purchased as a commercial product like Mega-Grow and is used to
extend the grow season and force larger blooms.
For best effect, use GA in complement with fertilizer and mixed into the water supply. Results
can be seen in as little as a few weeks.
According to the Material Safety Data Sheet
(MSDS), GA is very hazardous to humans, and I
do not advise using it; however, the retail advertisements claim the product is safe.

HUMIC ACID
Humic acids are carbons formed by the
decomposition of organic substances, primarily
that of vegetation. Applied to substrate, it
encourages the creation of strong tissue growth
and helps in nutrient transport. Plants grow

thicker foliage and are more resistant to drought
and disease.
Poor soils can be improved by humic acid
which enhances the water-holding capability
and aeration in sandy soils and frees up nutrients
bound in clay. It can be used as a root dip or
sprayed directly onto the soil.
Humic acids are extracted from humic substances found in soil. Colors range from yellow
(fulvic acid) to brown (humic acid) and black
(humin).
Fulvic acid is the fraction of humic substances
that is water soluble under all pH conditions.
Fulvic acid stays in solution after humic add dissipates due to acidification.
Humin is the fraction of the soil organic matter
that is not dissolved when the soil is treated with
dilute alkali.

HYDROGEN PEROXIDE
Hydrogen peroxide (H 20 2) is similar to water
but carries an extra, unstable, oxygen molecule
which can break down into a react·ive atom and
either attach itself to another oxygen atom or
attack an organic molecule.
Used in horticulture, hydrogen peroxide provides a host of benefits by cleansing water of
harmful substances such as spores, dead organic material, and disease-causing organisms while
preventing new infections from occurring. It
removes the methane and organic sulfates often
found in well water as well as removing chlorine
from tap water.
Hydrogen peroxide is especially useful in
hydroponics, where overwatering can be a problem. It prevents oxygen depletion in the water
around the roots, leading to better root growth.
A solution of hydrogen peroxide can be used to
sterilize seeds resulting in better germination
rates.
Hydrogen peroxide is dangerous at high concentrations (35%) and will damage skin, clothing. and most anything it contacts. Lower concentrations like those found at the drug store
(3%) will still need to be diluted before use,
though they are not as toxic to the gardener.

INDOLE 3 BUTYRIC ACID (IBA)
Indole 3 butyric acid is one of the auxin growth
hormones. It is most often used as an effective
rooting hormone. Application of IBA helps gen-

Introduction
Hydroponics is the science of growing plants
without soil, most often in a soilless mix. In fact,
many growers are already cultivating hydroponical·
ly. Cultivating clones in rockwool, peat moss, and
coconut fiber is growing hydroponically. Growing
mature plants in soilless Sunshine Mix or Terra-Lite,
even when watered by hand, is hydroponic gardening. With hydroponics, nutrient uptake and grow
medium oxygen content can be controlled easily.
Manage th ese two factors, along with a few other
requirements, to grow a bumper crop of buds with
every harvest.
The inert soilless hydroponic medium contains
essentially no nutrients. All the nutrients are supplied via the nutrient solution- fertilizer diluted in
water. This solution passes over or floods around
roots at regular intervals, later draining off. The extra
oxygen trapped in the soilless medium and around
the roots speeds nutrient uptake by tiny root hairs.
Cannabis grows last hydroponically, because it is
able to take in food as last as it can be used. In soil,
as in hydroponics, the roots absorb nutrients and
water. Even the best soil rarely has as much oxygen
in it as a soilless hydroponic medium.

Contrary to popular belief, hydroponic gardens
often require more care than soil gardens. If growing hydroponically, expect to spend more time in
the gard en. Extra maintenance is necessary
because plants grow faster, there are more things
to check, and more can go wrong. In fact, some
growers do not like hydroponic gardening. because
it requires too much additional care.
Hydroponic gardening is productive, but
exacting-not as forgiving as soil gardening. Soil
works as a buffer for nutrients and holds them
longer than inert hydroponic growing mediums. In
fact, advanced aeroponic systems do not use a soilless mix; they use nothing at all!
In hydroponics, the nutrient solution can be controlled, so plants grow less leafy foliage and more
dense flower buds. The stepped-up nutrient control
makes plants flower faster and be ready lor harvest
a few days earlier than soil-grown cannabis.
Small flowering plants grow well in small hydroponic containers and horizontal tubes. Mother
plants grow longer and are best suited to a large
bucket system, which allows room for root development. The mother plants' root system is easily
contained in the bucket, and she is able to produce

thous,ands of clones during her lifetime. Mother
plants must have a huge root system to take in lots
of nutrients to keep up with the heavy growth and
clone production schedule.
Most grow rooms have two limiting factors: the
number of plants in the garden and the electrical
consumption expressed in watts. For example, if
growing 12 1arge plants in a five-gallon (19 L) buck·
et hydroponic system, you will need about ten
clones and one mother plant. The flowering room
could be illuminated with two GOO-watt HP sodium
lamps. A 40-watt fluorescent fixture could be used
to root clones, and a 175-watt metal halide will
keep the mother and vegetative plants growing.
This is a total of 141 5 watts that cost about $35 to
$60 monthly. That's a bargain, considering the garden will yield at least a pound (450 gm) of beautiful hydroponic buds every month!
If flowering is induced when clones are six to
eight inches (15-20 em) tall, they will be two to
three feet (60-80 em) tall when they finish flowering. You can pack short plants tightly together in a
"sea of green" (SOG) or a "screen of green"
(SCROG) to maximize yield. It is easy to grow 60,

four-inch (10 em) rockwool cubes on a flood and
drain table or in three-gallon (11 L) grow bags full
of soilless medium. To get the maximum yield, a
plant or two is harvested every day or two. When a
ripe plant is harvested, two small clones take its
place. The weaker clone is culled out after two
weeks.

Different Systems
Hydroponic systems are distinguished by the way
the nutrient solution is applied. The first distinction
is whether the nutrient solution is applied in an
"active'' or "passive" manner.
Passive systems rely on capillary action to trans·
fer the nutrient solution from the reservoir to the
growing medium. Nutrient solution is passively
absorbed by a wick or growing medium and transported to the roots. Absorbent growing mediums
such as vermiculite, sawdust, peat moss, etc., are
ideal for passive systems. The growing medium can
stay very wet in passive systems, and substrate
selection is important Soggy substrates hold less
air and deprive roots of rapid nutrient uptake.
Although passive gardens are not considered "high

performance," the Dutch have managed to perfect
them and achieve amazing results. Wick systems
have no moving parts. Seldom does anything break
or malfunction. Low initial cost and low maintenance enhance wick systems' popularity.
Dutch growers line the floor of a room with heavy
plastic or pond liner. They fill three-gallon (3 L) pots
with an absorbent soilless mix that holds plenty of
air. They flood the garden with two to three inches
(6-9 em) of nutrient solution. Roots absorb the
nutrient solution in two to five days. No nutrient
solution is drained off; it is all absorbed by plants!
One Spanish grower uses passive irrigation to
water his garden. He drives a delivery truck and is
away from home five days a week. He keeps his
indoor garden under a 400-watt HPS lamp. The
plants are in a rich potting soil, and the pots are in
a large tray with four-inch ( 12 em) sides. Every
Monday morning he fills the tray wi th mild nutrient
solution. When he returns on Friday, the plants are
strong and happy!
Active hydroponic systems "actively" move the
nutrient solution. Examples of active systems are:
flood and drain, and top feed. Cannabis is a fastgrowing plant and very well suited to active hydroponic systems.
Active hydroponic gardens are considered a
"recovery" system if the nutrient solution is recovered and reused after irrigation. A "non-recovery"
system applies the nutrient solution once, then it
runs to waste. The solution is not reused. Nonrecovery systems have few complications but are
not practical for most cannabis hydroponic gardens. The commercial growers ''run-to-waste'' systems are avoided, because they pollute ground
water with high levels of nitrates, phosphates, and
other elements. Indoor growers seldom use nonrecovery systems, because they require disposing
of so much nutrient solution into the local sewer
system.
Active recovery hydroponic systems such as the
flood and drain (ebb and flow), top feed, and nutrient film technique (NFT) are the most popular and
productive available today. All three systems cycle
reused nutrient solution into contact with roots.
Recovering and reusing the nutrient solution

makes management more complex, but with the proper
nutrient solution, schedule, and a little experience, it is easy
to manage. Active recovery systems use growing mediums
that drain rapidly and hold plenty of air, including: expanded clay, pea gravel, pumice rock, crushed brick, rockwool,
and coconut coir.

Ebb and Flow Gardens
Ebb and flow (flood and drain) hydroponic systems are
popular because they have proven track records as low maintenance, easy-to-use gardens. Ebb and flow systems are versatile, simple by design, and very efficient Individual plants in
pots or rockwool cubes are set on a special table. The table is
a growing bed that can hold one to four inches (3·10 em) of
nutrient solution. Nutrient solution is pumped into the table
or growing bed. The rockwool blocks or containers are flood·
ed from the bottom, which pushes the oxygen-poor air out
Once the nutrient solution reaches a set level, an overflow
pipe drains the excess to the reservoir. When the pump is
turned off and the growing medium drains, it draws new oxygen-rich air into contact with the roots. A maze of drainage
gullies in the bottom of the table directs runoff solution back
to the catchment tank or reservoir. This cycle is repeated sev·
eral times a day. Ebb and flow systems are ideal for growing
many short plants in a Sea of Green garden.

Nutrient solution floods the growing bed and drains back into
a reservoir in an ebb and flow garden.

Nutrient solution is pumped up into tl1e
bed via the short flood fixture on the left.
The overflow fitting on the right guarantees
the nutrient solution will not spill over the
top of the table.

Self-leveling legs, similar to those of a
was/ling machine, support this ebb and
flow garden bed and ensure all plants
receive a level dose of nutrient solution
and that it all drains back into the reservoir
below.

'Nu,trie11t solution can be applied from above and the
!tat,fe serves as a drain.

Flood the table to half to three-quarters the height
of the container to ensure even nutrient solution distribution. Avoid lightweight mediums such as perlite
that may cause containers to float and fall over.
A large volume of water is necessary to fill the
entire table. Make sure the reservoir has enough
solution to flood the reservoir and still retain a minimum of 25 percent extra to allow for daily evaporation. Replenish reservoir daily if necessary. Do not Jet
nutrient solution stand in the table for more than a
half hour. Submerged roots drown in the depleted
oxygen environment.
Flood the table when the medium is about half-full
of moisture. Remember, rockwool holds a Jot of
moisture. Irrigation regimens will need to change
substantially when temperatures cool and light is
lacl<ing.
Ebb and flow tables or growing beds are
designed to let excess water flow freely away from
the growing medium and roots. When flooded with
an inch (3 ern) or more of nutrient solution, the
growing medium wicks up the solution into the
freshly aerated medium.

ating principle is simple, effective, and nearly failsafe. The nutrient solution is forced up to the growing bed with air pressure generated by an external
air pump. The pump can run on ordinary household electrical current or a solar-powered 12-volt
system. Once flooded, the nutrient solution stays in
the growing bed for a few minutes before it drains
back to the reservoir. Constant air pressure during
flooding also aerates the growing medium. The
sealed, airtight reservoir limits evaporation, which
in turn prevents algae growth and keeps the nutrient fresh. The external pump reduces the overall
cost of the system and helps prevent electrical accidents. You can use rockwool, coco coir, peat, or a
composite growing medium with excellent results.

Deep Water Culture (DWC)
Growing in deep water culture (DWC) is simple,
easy, and productive.
If growing outdoors in a DWC garden, a simple
overflow drainage hole can be cut in the side of the
reservoir to prevent rainwater from causing it to
overnow.
Seedlings and clones are held in net pots full of
expanded clay pellets, rockwool or other growing
medium. The net pots are nestled in holes in a lid
that covers the reservoir. The roots of seedlings and
cuttings dangle down into the nutrient solution. A
submersible pump lifts nutrient solution to the top
of a discharge tube where it splashes into the
access lid. Nutrient solution cascades down, wetting roots and splashing into the self-contained
reservoir below, which in turn increases dissolved
oxygen in the solution. Roots easily absorb nutrients and water from the solution in the oxygenated environment. Many gardens also keep an air
stone bubbling new air into the reservoir to supply
more oxygen.
These gardens are simple by design and require
no timer, because the pumps are on 24 hours a
day. This low-maintenance garden is perfect for
casual gardeners as well as hydroponic enthusiasts.

This ingenious owe garden uses an air pump to
aerate and agitate the nutrient solution.

Various emitters are available to apply nutrient solution. A single application point is common
when growing in absorbent growing mediums such as rocl<wool and coco coir. Expanded clay
works best when nutrient solution is applied via a large round emitter, several single emitters, or
a spray emitter.
Always use a filter when using
emitters. The filter will remove

Top-Feed Systems
Top-feed hydroponic systems are very productive,
easy to control, precise, easy to maintain, and effi·
cient. The nutrient solution is metered out in specific doses and delivered via spaghetti tubing or an
emitter placed at the base of individual plants.
Aerated nutrient solution flows into the growing
medium and is taken up by roots. The runoff nutri·
ent solution is directed back to the reservoir as
soon as it drains from the growing medium.
Rocl<wool, gravel, coconut coir, and expanded clay
are the most common growing mediums found in
top-feed systems. Versatile top-feed systems can be
used with individual containers or slabs in individ·
ual beds or lined up on tables.
Top-feed systems come in many configurations.
Systems with several gallons of growing medium
are best for growing large plants that may require
support. Small containers are perfect for smaller
plants.

Top-Feed Slabs
Overview

Containers are irrigated with spaghetti tubes
at,tached to a manifold that runs between the rows.
Excess nutrient solution drains out the bottom and is
directed back to the reservoir via a drain tube.

Top-feed slab systems are popular among small
and large indoor and greenhouse growers.
Rockwool or coco slabs covered in plastic serve as
growing containers. The nutrient solution is deliv·
ered via spaghetti tubes from the top of the slab.
An emitter attached to the spaghetti tube doses a
specific measure of nutrient solution to each plant.
The nutrient solution is aerated as it is applied,
before being absorbed by the growing medium
and draining back to the reservoir.
A simple nutrient solution delivery manifold con·
sists of emitters connected to spaghetti delivery
tubes. The tubes are attached to a short manifold
that is fed by a pump submerged in a reservoir.
Emitters are designed to be anchored in growing
medium and to emit a measured dose of nutrient
solution.

Slabs in individual trays
Some systems use individual trays to contain
slabs. Nutrient solution is pumped from the reser·
voir and delivered to plants via spaghetti tubes
attached to emitters. Individual trays are easy to
configure for different sized gardens.

This cutaway of a top-feed bucket system shows how
roots dangle in a I 00 percent humid environment
before growing into the nutrient solution. Remember
to screen the drain in the reservoir so roots do not
block it.

You can also set up a drainage table and place
slabs on top. The nutrient solution is pumped from
the reservoir below the table and delivered to indi·
vidual plants via spaghetti tubes attached to emit·
ters. The solution flows into the growing medium
vyhere it comes into contact with roots. Excess
nutrient solution drains from pots onto the table
and is carried back to the reservoir. Make sure the
table is set up on an incline so it drains evenly.
Pockets of standing water on the table contain less
oxygen and promote rot.

Individual Blocks
Individual blocks in this rockwool system allow
gardeners the possibility of removing or changing
plants if necessary. Nutrient solution is pumped via

spaghetti tubes from the reservoir below and distributed via emitters pressed into rockwool cubes.

Vertical Top-Feed Systems
Vertical gardens can increase overall yield more
than ten-fold over a flat garden. Substrate bags,
tubes, or slabs are positioned vertically around an
HID. Short plants are placed in the medium and
fed individually with a drip emitter. The runoff
drains through the growing medium and back to
the reservoir. The solution is re-circulated once it
returns to the reservoir.

Nutrient solution from this bat of Canna coco drains
into on open trough and is carried back to the reservoir. Salt buildup from the nutrient solution is easy to
scrub out of the open trough.

Spaghetti tubes irrigate plants from the top.

Tflis cutaway drawing shows how nutrient delivery is

Tllis new vertical garden uses rockwool as a growing
medium and compact fluorescent lamps.

Use rockwool or coco mixed with lightweight vermiculite as a growing medium to lessen weight
when substrate is wet. Irrigate constantly to keep
roots supplied with water and nutrients from a
well-aerated solution.
Vertical hydroponic systems save space, but
require more maintenance. These systems can also
be tricky to fine-tune so they operate at peak
capacity.

NFT
Nutrient Film Technique (NFI) hydroponic sys·
terns are high performance gardens that perform
well when fine-tuned. This relatively new form of
hydroponics supplies aerated nutrient solution to
roots located in gullies. Seedlings or cuttings with a
strong root system are placed on capillary matting
located on the bottom in a covered channel. The
capillary matting stabilizes nutrient solution flow
and holds roots in place. Constantly aerated nutri·
ent solution flows down the channel, or gully, over
and around the roots, and back to the reservoir.
Irrigation is most often constant, 24 hours a day.
Roots receive plenty of oxygen and are able to
absorb a maximum of nutrient solution. Proper
gully incline, volume, and flow of nutrient solution
are key elements in NFT gardens.
Gullies or channels are covered to keep humidity
high in the root zone and light from shining on
roots. Root hairs responsible for most water and
nutrient uptake cover the growing tips of advancing
roots. These roots are submerged in turbulently

flowing nutrient solution and the tops are intermit·
tently in humid air. The nutrient solution is constantly aerated as it flows down the inclined gulley.
The slope of the gulley is adequate to prevent
water from stagnating. Often a filter is necessary to
prevent debris from blocking gullies and pump.
Although high performance, NFT systems offer
practically no buffering ability. In the absence of a
growing medium, roots must be kept perfectly
moist by the nutrient solution at all times. If a
pump fails, roots dry and die. If the system dries out
for a day or longer, small feeder roots will die and
grave consequences will result. The system is very
easy to clean and lay out after each crop. Only
growers with several years experience should try an
NFT system if working alone. With help, they are
easier to master.
Double reinforced bottom makes gullies durable
and rigid when supporting large plants, root systems, and large volumes of nutrient solution. Some
NFT gullies have ribs below to provide support and
prevent warping and movement. The ribs also function as drainage channels and direct nutrient solution evenly along the bottom of the gully.
Many NFT systems are hybrids. For example, the
nutrient solution in some hybrid NFT systems is
delivered via spaghetti tubing to each plant More
irrigation sites help each plant receive proper irrigation. The nutrient solution flows through a small
basket of growing medium before it runs down the
gulley, over the roots, and back to the reservoir. Yet
another hybrid NFT system employs spray nozzles
inside the gulley. The nozzles spray nutrient solution on and around roots to keep the root zone
environment at 100 percent humidity. The nutrient
solution flows down a PVC pipe, over roots, and
back to the reservoir.
·Too often, these hybrid systems are poorly
planned and designed. Many times they are constructed from white four-inch PVC pipe. The thin
white walls of the PVC pipe allow enough light to
illuminate roots that they turn green or rot more
easily. I have also seen systems with nozzles inside
the PVC pipe. If a nozzle plugged inside the pipe,
there was no easy way to access the nozzle for
maintenance.

Nutrient solution is pumped from the reservoir
into gullys via a manifold and tubing at the upper
end. The table is set up on an incline so the nutrient solution flows quickly over roots to create an
environment packed with air and available nutrients. A catchment drain directs the nutrient back
into the nutrient reservoir.

Aeroponics
Aeroponic systems use no growing medium and
offer the highest performance possible. Roots are
suspended in a darl< growth chamber without
growing medium where they are misted with oxygen-rich nutrient solution at regular intervals. The
humidity in the chamber remains at or near 100
percent 24 hours a day. Roots have the maximum
potential to absorb nutrient in the presence of air.

Gullies with rounded corners are very popular in
Australia. Growers who use them say the nutrient
solution flows more smoothly.

Mcmy gullies are flat on the bottom. Capillary matting

This system produced a heavy harvest of buds
on robust plants.

Humid air and nutrient solution are all that fill the
growth chamber. Plants are most often grown in
net pots full of growing medium and suspended
from the top of the system.
Aeroponic systems require greater attention to
detail. There is no growing medium to act as a
water/nutrient bank, which makes the system delicate and touchy to use. If the pump fails, roots
soon dry, and plants suffer. Systems that use delicate spray nozzles must be kept free of debris.
Imbalanced nutrient solution and pH can also
cause problems quickly. This is why it is important
to purchase quality components or a ready-made
system from a qualified supplier.
The RainForest (Www.generalby,d.umooics.com)
is very popular. Nutrient solution is actually atomized into the air creating 100 percent humidity.
Nutrient solution is dripped onto a spinning plate.
The solution atomizes, mixing with the air as it
spins off the plate. The spinning plate is located
above the water in the reservoir.

Growing Mediums

Long root systems devefop quickly on cuttings in this
Rain Forest oeroponic system.

Rooted clones and seedlings grown in aeroponic systems develop exceptionally fast. To grow clones, simply Insert clone stems into the growth chamber and
turn it on. The roots will grow in a perfect environment to develop roots.

Soilless growing mediums provide support for
the root system, as well as hold and make available
oxygen, water, and nutrients. Three factors contribute to cannabis roots' ability to grow in a substrate: texture, pH, and nutrient content, which is
measured in EC, electrical conductivity.
The texture of any substrate is governed by the
size and physical structure of the particles that constitute it. Proper texture promotes strong root penetration, oxygen retention, nutrient uptake, and
drainage. Growing mediums that consist of large
particles permit good aeration and drainage.
Increased irrigation frequency is necessary to comP.ensate for low water retention. Water- and airholding ability and root penetration are a function
of texture. The smaller the particles, the closer they
pack together and the slower they drain. Larger

Irregular shaped substrates such as perlite and
some expanded clays have more surface area and
hold more water than round soilless mediums.
Avoid crushed gravel with sharp edges that cut into
roots if the plant falls or is jostled around. Round

pea gravel; smooth, washed gravel; and lava rocks

ideal for passive hydroponic systems that operate
via capillary action.
Mineral growing mediums are inert and do not
react with living organisms or chemicals to change
the integrity of the nutrient solution. Coconut coir
and peat mosses are also inert.
Non-inert growing mediums cause unforeseen
problems. For example, gravel from a limestone
quarry is full of calcium carbonate, and old concrete
is full of lime. When mixed with water, calcium carbonate will raise the pH, and it is very difficult to
make it go down. Growing mediums made from
reconstituted concrete bleed out so much lime,
they soon kill the garden.
Avoid substrates found within a few miles of the
ocean or large bodies of salt water. Most likely,
such mediums are packed with toxic salts. Rather
than washing and leaching salts from the medium,
it is easier and more economical to find another
source of substrate.
Air is a great medium when it is filled with 100
percent humidity 24 hours a day.
Coconut fiber is an excellent hydroponic medium. See "Coconut Fiber" under soil amendments. Coconut· fiber is also available in bogs.
Hit the site www.canna,com for detailed information about growing marijuana in coconut fiber.
Expanded clay, also called hydroclay, or hydrocorn, is made by many different manufacturers. The
clay pellets are cooked at high temperatures in a
kiln until they expand. Many little catacomb-like
pockets form inside each pellet that holds air and
nutrient solution. It is an excellent medium to mix
with Peat-Lite and to grow mothers in large containers. I like the way it drains so well and still
retains nutrient solution while holding lots of oxygen. Examples of expanded clay include commerExpanded clay holds moisture one/nutrients along

Artificial foam slabs are used by some
growers. To date they ore still gaining
popularity.

Pumice is a goo'd growing medium. It can
also be used as mulch or as an inerr soil
amendment.

---

Peat moss mixed with perlite is one of rhe
all-time favorite growing mediums. It is
also an excellenr soil amendment:

•

Perlite is sand or volcanic glass expanded
by heat. See Chapter Ten for more information.

Some clay pellets will float.
Expanded clay can be reused again and again. Once used,
pour expanded clay pellets into a container and soak in a sterilizing solution of ten milliliters hydrogen peroxide per four
liters of water. Soak for 20·30 minutes. Remove expanded
clay and place on a screen of hardware cloth. Wash and separate clay pellets from dead roots and dust. Let dry and reuse.
Expanded mica is similar to expanded clay. For lots of exacting information on how and why this stuff works so well,
check out wvvw,hv.2r.Qponics.com.
Foam is somewhat popular. It lasts a long time, lends itself
to easy sterilization, and holds a lot of water and air.
Gravel is one of the original hydroponic mediums. Although
heavy, gravel is inert, holds plenty of air, drains well, and is
inexpensive. Still popular today, gravel is difficult to overwater. It holds moisture, nutrient, and oxygen on its outer surfaces. Use pea gravel or washed river gravel with round edges
that do not cut roots when jostled about. Gravel should be
0.125-0.375-inches (3·10 mm) in diameter, with more than
half of the medium about 0.25-inch (6 mm) across. Crushed
rock can be packed with many salts. Pre-soak and adjust its
pH before use. Gravel has low water retention and low buffering ability.
Pumice is a naturally occurring, porous, lightweight, volcanic
rock that holds moisture and air in catacomb-like surfaces.
Light and easy to work with, some lava rock is so light it floats.
Be careful that sharp edges on the rocks do not damage roots.
Lava rock is still a good medium and acts similarly to expanded clay. See "Pumice" under "Soil Amendments."
Peat moss is partially decomposed vegetation.
Decomposition has been slow in the northern regions where
it is found in bogs. There are three common kinds of peat
moss- Sphagnum, 1-lypnum, and Reed/Sedge. Sphagnum
peat is about 75 percent fiber with a pH of 3 to 4. Hypnum
peat is about 50 percent fiber with a pH of about 6.
Reed/sedge peat is about 35 percent fiber with a pH of six or
•
more. For more information see "Soil Amendments" in
Chapter Ten.
Perlite drains fast, but it's very light and tends to float when
flooded with water. Perlite has no buffering capacity and is
best used to aerate soil or soilless mix. See "Soil
Amendments" in Chapter Ten.
Rockwool is an exceptional growing medium and a favorite
of many growers. It is an inert, sterile, porous, non-degradable
growing medium that provides firm root support. Rockwool

has the ability to hold water and air for the roots.
The roots are able to draw in most of the water
stored in the rockwool, but it has no buffering
capacity and a high pH. Rockwool is probably the
most popular hydroponic growing medium in the
world. Popular brand names include Grodan,
HydroGro and Vacrok.
Sand is heavy and has no buffering ability. Some
sand has a high pH. Make sure to use sharp river
sand. Do not use ocean or salty beach sand. Sand
drains quickly but still retains moisture. Sand is best
used as a soil amendment in volumes of less than
ten percent.
Sawdust holds too much water for marijuana
growth and is usually too acidic. Be wary of soils
with too much wood matter. Such mediums use
available nitrogen to decompose the leglin in the
wood.
Vermiculite holds a lot of water and is best suited for rooting cuttings when it is mixed with sand
or perlite. With excellent buffering qualities, vermiculite holds lots of water and has traces of magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), aluminum (AI), and
Silicon (Si). Do not use construction grade vermiculite which is treated with phytotoxic chemicals.
See "Soil Amendments" in Chapter Ten for more
information.
Water alone is a poor medium, because it cannot
hold enough oxygen to support plant life. When
aerated, water becomes a good growing medium.

Rockwool cubes hold plenty of air and nutrient solution
within their fiber; plus, they are clean and easy to use.

pH
The pH of the nutrient solution controls the availability of ions that cannabis needs to assimilate.
Marijuana grows well hydroponically within a pl-l
range of 5.5-6.5, with 5.8-6.0 being ideal. The pl-l in
hydroponic gardens requires a somewhat vigilant
eye. In hydroponics, the nutrients are in solution
and more available than when in soil. The pl-l of
the solution can fluctuate a half point and not
cause any problems.
Roots take in nutrients at different rates, which
causes the ratios of nutrients in solution to change
the pl-l. When the pH is above 7 or below 5.5,
some nutrients are not absorbed as fast as possi-

Vermiculite holds a lot of nutrient solution.

ble. Check the pH every day or two to make
sure it is at or near the perfect level.
Deviations in pH levels often affect element
solubility. Values change slightly with different plants, grow mediums, and hydroponic
systems. Overall, hydroponic gardens require
lower pH levels than that of soil. The best pH
range for hydroponic gardens is from 5.5 to
6.5. Different mediums perform best at different pH levels. Follow manufacturer's
guidelines for pH level, and correct the pH
using the manufacturer's suggested chemicals, because they will react best with their
fertilizer.
The pH can easily fluctuate up and down
one full point in hydroponic systems and
cause little or no problem with nutrient
uptake.
Follow the directions on the container, and
remember to mix adjusters into the reservoir
slowly and completely. Fertilizers are normally acidic and lower the pH of the nutrient
solution. But nutrient solution is still taken in
by plants, and water transpires and evaporates into the air, which causes the pl-1 to
climb.
Stabilize the pH of the water before adding
fertilizer.
Make a correction if readings vary ± onehalf point.

EC, TDS, DS, CF, PPM
EC METERS
Pure distilled water has no resistance and conducts no electrical current. When impurities are
added to pure distilled water in the form of fertilizer salts, it conducts electricity. A water analysis will
indicate the impurities or dissolved solids found in
household tap water. These impurities conduct
electricity.
Nutrient (salt) concentrations are measured by
their ability to conduct electricity through a solution. Dissolved ionic salts create electrical current in
solution. The main constituent of hydroponic solutions is ionic salts. Several scales are currently used
to measure how much electricity is conducted by
nutrients including: Electrical Conductivity (EC),
Conductivity Factor (CF), Parts Per Million (ppm),
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and Dissolved Solids
(OS). Most American growers use ppm to measure
overall fertilizer concentration. European,
Australian, and New Zealand growers use EC, however they still use CF in parts of Australia and New
Zealand. Parts per million is not as accurate or consistent as EC to measure nutrient solution strength.
The difference between EC, CF, ppm, TDS, and OS
is more complex than originally meets the eye.
Different measurement systems all use the same
base, but interpret the information differently. Let's
start with EC, the most accurate and consistent
scale.
Electrical conductivity is measured 1n
milliSiemens per centimeter (mS/cm) or
microSiemens per centimeter (iJS/cm). One
microSiemen/cm = 1000 milliSiemens/cm.
Parts per million testers actually measure in EC
and convert to ppm. Unfortunately, the two scales
(EC and ppm) are not directly related. Each nutrient or salt gives a different electronic discharge
reading. To overcome this obstacle, an arbitrary
standard was implemented which assumes "a specific EC equates to a specific amount of nutrient
solution." Consequently, the ppm reading is not
precise; it is only an approximation, a ball park figure! It gets more complex! Nutrient tester manufacturers use different standards to convert from EC to
the ppm reading.

meters that was easy to use.

Every salt in a multi-element solution has a different conductivity factor.
Pure water will not conduct electrical
current, but when elemental
salts/metals are added, electrical conductivity increases proportionately.
Simple electronic meters measure this
value and interpret it as total dissolved
solids (TDS). Nutrient solutions used

to grow marijuana generally range between 500
and 2000 ppm. If the solution concentration is too
high, the internal osmotic systems can reverse and
actually dehydrate the plant. In general, try to maintain a moderate value of approximately 800 to
1200 ppm.
Nutrient solution concentration levels are affected
by nutrient absorption by roots and by water evaporation. The solution weakens as plants use nutrients, but water also evaporates from the solution,
which increases the nutrient concentration. Adjust
the concentration of the solution by adding fertilizer or diluting with more water.
Many factors can alter the EC balance of a solution. For example, if under-watered or allowed to
dry completely, the EC reading will rise. In fact, the
EC may increase to two- or three-times as high as
the input solution when too little water is applied
to rockwool. This increase in slab EC causes some
nutrients to build up faster than others. When the
EC doubles, the amount of sodium can increase as
much as four- to six-fold under the right conditions!
There should not be any sodium present in your

Parts per million meters measure the overall
level of dissolved solids or fertilizer salts. Each
fertilizer salt conducts different quantities of
electricity. Use a calibrating solution that imitates the fertilizer in the nutrient solution to calibrate ppm or EC meters. Using such a solution
ensures the meter readings will be as accurate
as possible. For example, 90 percent of ammonium nitrate dissolved in water is measured,
and a mere 40 percent of the magnesium is
measured! Do not use sodium-based calibration
~olutions. They are intended for other applications than gardening. Purchase calibrating solution from the manufacturer or retailer when you
buy the meter. Ask for a stable calibrating solution that mimics your fertilizer. Calibrate EC and
ppm meters regularly. A good combination
ppm, EC, pH meter that compensates for temperature costs about $200 and is well worth the
money. Batteries last a long time, too.

garden unless it is in the water supply, and it
should not be in excess of 50 ppm.
Let 10·20 percent of the nutrient solution drain
from the growing medium after each irrigation
cycle to help maintain EC stability. The runoff carries away any excess fertilizer salt buildup in the
growing medium.
If the EC level of a solution is too high, increase
the amount of runoff you create with each flush.
Instead of a 10·20 percent runoff, flush so 20·30
percent of the solution runs off. To raise the EC, add
more fertilizer to the solution, or change the nutri·
ent solution.
A dissolved solids (DS) measurement indicates
how many parts per million (ppm) of dissolved
solids exist in a solution. A reading of 1800 ppm
means there are 1800 parts of nutrient in one million parts solution, or 1800/1,000,000.
An EC meter measures the overall volume or
strength of elements in water or solution. A digital
LCD screen displays the reading or the EC of the
electrical current flowing between the two electrodes. Pure rainwater has an EC close to zero.
Check the pH and EC of rainwater to find out if it is
acidic (acid rain) before using it.
Distilled bottled water from the grocery store
often registers a small amount of electrical resistance, because it is not perfectly pure. Pure water
with no resistance is very difficult to obtain and not
necessary for a hydroponic nutrient solution.
Electrical conductivity measurement is temperature-sensitive and must be factored into the EC
reading to retain accuracy. High-quality meters
have automatic and manual temperature adjustments. Calibrating an EC meter is similar to
calibrating a pH meter. Simply follow manufacturer's instructions. For an accurate reading, make sure
your nutrient solution and stock solution are the
same temperature.
Inexpensive meters last for about a year, and
expensive meters can last for many years. However,
the life of most EC meters, regardless of cost, is
contingent upon regular maintenance. The probes
must be kept moist and clean at all times. This is
the most important part of keeping the meter in
good repair. Read instructions on care and mainte-

nance. Watch for corrosion buildup on the probes
of your meter. When the probes are corroded, readings will not be accurate.
To check the EC of the nutrient solution, collect
samples from both the reservoir and the growing
medium. Save time and effort; collect EC and pl-1
samples simultaneously. Collect samples with a
syringe or baster at least two inches deep into the
rockwool and coco. Collect separate sample from
the reservoir. Place each sample in a clean jar. Use
calibrated EC meter to measure the samples.
Under normal conditions, the EC in the slab should
be a little higher than the nutrient solution in the
reservoir. If the EC of the solution drawn from the
growing medium is substantially higher than the
one from the reservoir, there is a salt buildup in the
substrate. Correct the imbalance by flushing substrate thoroughly with diluted nutrient solution,
and replace with new solution. Regularly check the
EC of your water, slab, and runoff.

Sterilizing
To reuse a growing medium, it must be sterilized
to remove destructive pests and diseases.
Sterilizing is less expensive and often easier than
replacing the growing medium. Sterilizing works
best on rigid growing mediums that do not lose
their shape such as gravel, expanded clay, and
mica. Avoid sterilizing and reusing substrates that
compact and lose structure such as rockwool,
coconut coir, peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite.
Avoid problems caused by compaction and dead
roots by replacing used growing mediums. Once
sterilized, the medium is free of harmful microor·
ganisms including bacteria and fungi, plus pests
and their eggs.
Remove roots from the growing medium before
sterilizing. A three- to four-month-old marijuana
plant has a root mass about the size of an old desk
telephone. Separate the medium by shaking and
pulling roots away. Bounce the medium on a
screen so roots come to the top. Scoop up and
remove roots by hand. Fewer decaying roots cause
fewer pest and disease problems, and decrease
incidence of clogged feeder tubes.

Remove harvested plant root balls from the growing
medium, and remove roots and stems.

Wash substrate with plenty of fresh water to remove
built-up salts and clead roots.

Substrate can also be washed in a large container such as a barrel or bathtub. Washing works
best with lighter substrates such as expanded clay
or mica. Roots float to the top and are readily
skimmed off with a screen or by hand.
Once roots are removed, soak the substrate in a
sterilant such as a five percent laundry bleach
(calcium or sodium hypochlorite) solution for at
least an hour. Or mix hydrochloric acid, the kind
used in hot tubs and swimming pools. Pour,
drain, or pump off the sterilant, and flush the
medium with plenty of fresh water. A bathtub and
a shower nozzle on a hose are perfect for washing substrate. Place the substrate in the bathtub,
set a screen over the drain, and use the showerhead or a hose to wash down the medium. It may
be necessary to fill the tub with fresh water and
drain it a couple of times to rinse any residual
sterilants from the substrate.
If you decide to use rockwool or coco a second
time, you may have problems with pests and diseases. In general, I recommend reusing a medium only if it does not deteriorate or compact.
Examples include: pea gravel, expanded clay, lava
rock, sand, etc. Once used indoors, reuse rocl<wool and biodegradable coco in the outdoor garden.
To sterilize a hydroponic garden, remove the
nutrient solution from the reservoir. Pump the
solution into the outdoor garden. Avoid pumping
it down household drains, and definitely do not
pump it into a septic tank. The nutrients will disrupt the chemistry!
Flood the growing medium with the sterilizing
solution for at least one-half hour, let drain, and
flush again. Pump the bleach solution out of the
system and down the drain. Do not dump sterilants outdoors; they will defoliate plants where
they are dumped. Use lots of fresh water to leach
and flush the entire system including beds, connecting hoses, drains, and reservoir. Make sure all
residues are gone by flushing entire system twice
for a half-hour. Remove all solution from the
tank, and scrub away any visible signs of salt
buildup with a big soapy sponge. Have a bucket
of clean water handy to rinse the sponge.

An alternate sterilization method is to "solarize"
the rockwool. In a sunny location, set dry slabs of
rockwool outside on a sheet of black plastic, and
cover with black plastic. Let the sun bake the layer
of slabs, or flock, for several days. The temperatures
in the rockwool will climb to 140"F (60"C) or more,
enough to sterilize for most all harmful diseases
and pests.

Hydroponic Nutrients
High quality hydroponic formulations are soluble,
contain all the necessary nutrients, and leave no
impure residues in the bottom of the reservoir.
Always use the best hydroponic fertilizer you can
find. There are many excellent commercial hydroponic fertilizers that contain all the nutrients in a
balanced form to grow great cannabis. Quality
hydroponic fertilizers packed in one, two, or threepart formulas have all 1he necessary macro- and
micronutrients for rapid nutrient assimilation and
growth. Cheap fertilizers contain low-quality,
impure components that leave residue and sedi·
ments. These impurities build up readily and cause
extra maintenance. High-quality, soluble hydroponic nutrients properly applied are immediately available for uptake. Exact control is much easier when
using pure high-grade nutrients. Many companies
use food-grade nutrients to manufacture their fer·
tilizer formulations.
Nutrients are necessary for marijuana to grow
and flourish. These nutrients must be broken down
chemically within the plant, regardless of origin.

The nutrients could be derived from a natural
organic base which was not heated or processed to
change form, or they could be simple chemical elements and compounds. VI/hen properly applied,
each type of fertilizer, orga11ic or chemical, theoret·
ically produces the same results.
For a complete backgrourtd on nutrients and fer·
tilizers, see Chapter Eleven, 'Water and Nutrients."
Many of the same principle:; that apply to soil apply
to the hydroponic medium.

Nutrient Solutions
To avoid nutrient problen1s, change the nutrient
solution in the reservoir ev•:ry week. Change nutri·
ent solution every two wlleks in systems with a
large reservoir. Change the nutrient solution more
often when plants are in tlte last stages of flower·
ing, because they use more nutrients. You can wait
to change the nutrient solution, but imbalances are
more common. Plants absorb nutrients at different
rates, and some of them run out before others,
which can cause more complex problems. The best
form of preventive mainteflance is to change the
solution often. Skimping on fertilizer can cause
stunted growth. Nutrient imbalances also cause the
pH to fluctuate, usually to drop. Nutrients used at
different rates create an irnbalanced formulation.
Avert problems by using pure nutrients and thor·
oughly flushing the soilleSS medium with fresh
tepid water between nutriont solutions.
Hydroponics gives the mi.lans to supply the maximum amount of nutrients a plant needs, but it can

To remove roots and
sterilize the growing medium :
1. Manually remove the mat of roots that are

entwined near the bottom of the bed, and shake
loose any attached growing medium. It may be
easier to add more medium than to picl< it from
between the matted roots
2. Pour growing mediums such as expanded clay
and gravel through a screen placed over a large
bucket Most of the roots will stay on the screen.
3. Lay growing medium out on the floor, and train
an oscillating fan on it to dry out remaining roots.

Here is one of the many popttlar brands of liquid

also starve them to death or rapidly over-fertilize
them. Remember, hydroponic systems are
designed for high performance. If one thing mal·
functions, say the electricity goes off, the pump
breaks, the drain gets clogged with roots, or there
is a rapid fluctuation in the pH, major problems
could result in the garden. A mistake could kill or
stunt plants so badly that they do not have time to
recover before harvest.

Solution Maintenance
Plants use so much water that nutrient solutions
need to be replenished regularly. Water is used at a
much faster rate than nutrients. Casually "topping
ofr' the reservoir with pH-balanced water will keep
the solution relatively balanced for a week or two.
Some growers top off the nutrient solution with
500· 700 ppm-strength nutrient solution every two
to three days. Never let the nutrient solution go for
more than four weeks before draining it and
adding fresh solution. Smart growers leach the
entire system with weak nutrient solution for an
hour or more between changing the reservoir.
Wipe down the entire system with the solution.
Do not flush with plain water. Flushing with mild
(quarter-strength) nutrient solution will actually
remove more excess fertilizer than plain water.
Check EC of reservoir, growing medium, and
runoff nutrient solution at the same t·ime every day.
Use an electronic EC pen to monitor the level of
dissolved solids in the solution. Occasionally you
will need to add more fertilizer concentrate to

maintain the EC level in the reservoir during the
"topping off" times. Keep the reservoir full at all
times. The smaller the reservoir, the more rapid the
depletion and the more critical it is to keep it full.
Smaller reservoirs should be refilled daily.

Nutrient Solution Composition
The chart at left is a guideline of satisfactory nutri·
ent limits expressed in ppm. Do not deviate too far
from these ranges to avert nutrient defi ciencies and
excesses.

Hydro-Organic
Hydro-Organic is a means of growing cannabis in
an inert soilless medium and feeding with a solu·
ble organic nutrient solution. Organic fertilizers are
most often defined as containing substances with a
carbon molecule or a natural unaltered substance
such as ground-up rocks.
Dedicated growers spend the time and trouble it
takes to grow hydro-organically, because the natural nutrients bring out a sweet organic taste in
buds. Indoor and outdoor crops grown in less than
90 days do not have time to wait for organic nutri·
ents to be broken down. Organic nutrients must be
soluble and readily available for short cannabis
crops to benefit.
An exact balance of organic nutrients can be
achieved with constant experimentation and atten·
tion to details. Even when you buy ready-mixed
commercial fertilizers like BioCanna, Earth Juice, or
Fox Farm, you will need to try different feeding
amounts and schedules to get the exact combination to grow top-quality bud.
Taking an accurate EC reading or mixing the exact
amount of a specific nutrient is very difficult in
organic hydroponics. Chemical fertilizers are easy
to measure out and apply. It is easy to give plants
the specific amount of fertilizer they need in each
stage of growth.
Organic nutrients have a complex structure, and
measuring content is difficult. Organics are difficult
to keep stable, too. Some manufacturers, including
BioCanna, Earth Juice, and Fox Farm, have managed to stabilize their fertilizers. When buying
organic nutrients, always buy from the same sup·

plier, and find out as much as possible about the
source from which the fertilizers were derived.
Combine premixed soluble organic fertilizers with
other organic ingredients to make your own blend.
Growers experiment to lind the perfect mix lor their
system and the varieties they are growing. Adding
too much fertilizer can toxify soil and bind up nutrients, making them unavailable. Foliage and roots
burn when the condition is severe.
Soluble organic fertilizers are fairly easy to flush
from the growing medium. Like chemical fertilizers,
organic fertilizers build to toxic levels easily. Look
lor the same symptoms as in soil-burned leaf tips,
discolored misshapen leaves, brittle leaves, etc.
Organic nutrients require heavier flushing. Rinse
medium with three gallons of water for every gallon of medium. Some growers flush with plain
water the last two weel<s of flowering to get all fertilizer taste out of buds.
Mix seaweed with macronutrients and secondary
nutrients to make a hydro-organic fertilizer. The
amount of primary and secondary nutrients is not
as important as the menagerie of trace elements
that are in an available form in the seaweed. Major
nutrients can be applied via soluble fish emulsion
for nitrogen; phosphorous and potassium are supplied by bat guano, bone meal, and manures. More
and more organic growers are adding growth stimulators such as humic acid, trichoderma bacteria,
and hormones.

Reservoirs
Nutrient solution reservoirs should be as big as
possible and have a lid to lessen evaporation.
Gardens use from 5·25 percent of the nutrient
solution every day. A big volume of nutrient solution will minimize nutrient imbalances. When the
water is used, the concentration of elements in the
solution increases; there is less water in the solution and nearly the same amount of nutrients. Add
water as soon as the solution level drops. TI1e
reservoir should contain at least 25 percent more
nutrient solution than it takes to fill the beds to
compensate for daily use and evaporation. The
greater the volume of nutrient solution, the more
forgiving the system and the easier it is to control.
Forgetting to replenish the water supply and/or
nutrient solution could result in crop failure.
Check the level of the reservoir daily, and replenish if necessary. A reservoir that loses more than 20
percent of its volume daily can be topped off with
pure or low (500 ppm) EC water. Sophisticated systems have a float valve that controls the level of
water in the reservoir.
II your reservoir does not have graduated measurements to denote liquid volume, use an indelible
marker to make a full line and the number of gallons or liters contained at that point on the inside
of the reservoir tank. Use this volume measure
when mixing nutrients.

Nutrient solution is aerated by falling through the air

l

A two·part nutrient solution is mixed before
application. Each reservoir holds one part
of the solution.

Attach a recirculating pipe with an on/off valve to
the pump outlet pipe. This is a convenient and easy·
to-control method of aerating the nutrient solution.

The pump should be set up to lift the solution out
of the reservoir. Set reservoirs high enough so
spent nutrient solution can be siphoned or gravityflow into a drain or the outdoor garden.

Reservoir Temperature
The temperature of the nutrient solution should
stay between 60-75"F (15-24"C). However, nutrient
solution will hold much more oxygen at GO"F
(l S"C) than it will at 75"F (24"C). Never let the
nutrient solution temperature climb above SS"F
(29"C). Above 85"F (29"C), the solution holds little
oxygen. Roots are easily damaged by temperatures
SS"F (29"C) and above. Heat-damaged roots are
very susceptible to rot, wilts, and fungus gnat
attacks.
To save energy and money, heat the nutrient
solution instead of the air in a room. Heat the nutrient solution with a submersible aquarium heater
or grounded propagation heating cables. The
heaters might take a day or longer to raise the temperature of a large volume of solution. Do not
leave heaters in an empty reservoir. They will soon
overheat and burn out. Aquarium heaters seldom
have ground wires, a seemingly obvious oversight.
But I have yet to learn of an electrocution by aquarium heater. Avoid submersible heaters that give off
harmful residues.
When air is cooler than water, moisture rapidly
evaporates into the air; the greater the temperature
diffe renti al, the higher the relative humidity.
Maintaining the nutrient solution temperature
around 60°F (lS"C) will help control transpiration
and humidity. It will also promote the uptake of
nutrients.
An air pump submerged in the reservoir not only
aerates the solution, it will help level out the temperature differential between ambient air and
reservoir.

Irrigation
Irrigation is a science unto itsel[ Irrigation cycles
depend on plant size, climate conditions, and the
type of medium used. Large, round, smooth particles of substrate drain rapidly and need to be irrigated more often- four to twelve times daily for

five- to thirty-minute cycles. Fibrous mediums with
irregular surfaces, such as vermiculite, drain slowly
and require less frequent watering, often just once
per day. The water comes to within one-half inch
(1.5 em) of the top of the gravel and should completely drain out of the medium after each water-

ing. Top-feed systems cycle for about five minutes or longer
and should be irrigated at least three times daily. Often growers cycle the nutrient solution 24 hours a day, especially when
growing in fast-draining expanded clay or similar mediums.
In fast-draining mediums, overhead irrigation is continual.
Drip irrigation in coco coir is four or five times daily. Flood and
drain irrigation cycles are five to ten times daily.
During and soon after irrigation, the nutrient content of the
bed and the reservoir are the same concentration. As time
passes between irrigations, the EC and the pH gradually
change. If enough time passes between irrigations, the nutrient concentration might change so much that the plant is not
able to draw it in.
There are many variations on how often to water. Experi·
mentation will tell you more than anything else.

Nutrient Disorders

Reservoir temperature range

Use an aquarium heater to warm cold
reservoirs. Do not let the reservoir dry
out when the heater is on or it will
bum out

When the hydroponic garden is on a regular maintenance
schedule, and the grower knows the crop well, nutrient problems are usually averted. If nutrient deficiency or excess affects
more than a few plants, check the irrigation fittings to ensure
nutrient-challenged plants are receiving a full dose of nutrient
solution. Next, check the substrate around affected plants to
ensure nutrient solution is penetrating entire medium and all
roots are wet. Check the root zone to ensure roots have not
plugged drainage conduits and are not standing in stagnant
solution.
Change the nutrient solution if there is a good flow of nutrient solution through the root zone, but plants still appear sick·
ly. Make sure the pH of the water is within the acceptable 5.5·
6.5 range before adding new nutrients.
If changing solution does not solve the problem, changing to
a new brand of fertilizer may do the trick. Check out the color
drawings of specific nutrient deficiencies and excesses in
Chapter Eleven to determine the exact problem, and add 10 to
20 percent more of the deficient nutrient in a chelated form
until the disorder has disappeared. Leach growing medium
with dilute nutrient solution to solve simple overdose nutrient
problems.
Hydroponic gardens have no soil to buffer the uptake of
nutrients. This causes nutrient disorders to manifest as discolored foliage, slow growth, spotting, etc., at a rapid rate. Novice
gardeners must learn how to recognize nutrient problems in
their early stages to avoid serious problems that cost valuable
time for plants to recoup. Treatment for a nutrient deficiency
or excess must be rapid and certain. But once treated, plants

take several days to respond to the remedy. For
a fast fix, foliar feed plants. See "Foliar Feeding"
in Chapter Eleven.
Nutrient deficiency or excess diagnosis
becomes difficult when two or more elements
are deficient or in excess at the same time.
Symptoms might not point directly at the cause.
Solve mind-bending unknown nutrient deficiency syndromes by changing the nutrient solution.
Plants do not always need an accurate diagnosis when the nutrient solution is changed.
Over-fertilization, once diagnosed, is easy to
remedy. Drain the nutrient solution. Flush the
system at least twice with fresh dilute (5·10 percent) nutrient solution to remove any lingering
sediment and salt buildup in the reservoir.
Replace with properly mixed solution.
Nutrient disorders most often affect a strain at
the same time when it is receiving the same
nutrient solution. Different varieties often react
differently to the same nutrient solution. Do not
confuse other problems- wind burn, lack of
light, temperature stress, fungi and pest damage- with nutrient deficiencies. Such problems
usually appear on individual plants that are
most affected. For example, foliage next to a
heat vent might show signs of heat scorch,
while the rest of the garden looks healthy. Or a
plant on the edge of the garden
would be small and leggy because
it receives less light.

Here ar:e some guidelines:

water; weigh pots to tell.
2. Water soil gardens when soil is dry onehalf inch (1 .5 em) below the surface.
3. Water soil gardens with a mild nutrient
solution and let 10·20 percent drain off at
each watering.
4. Do not let soil dry out to the point that
plants wilt.

Fresh air is essential in all gardens. Indoors, it
could be the difference between success and
failure. Outdoor air is abundant and packed
with carbon dioxide (COl) necessary for plant

Monitor temperawre and humidity regularly. The

life. For example, the level of C02 in the air over
a field of rapidly growing cannabis could be only
a third of normal on a very still day. Wind blows
in fresh COl·rich air. Rain washes air and plants
of dust and pollutants. The outdoor environment is often harsh and unpredictable, but
there is always fresh air. Indoor gardens must be
meticulously controlled to replicate the outdoor
atmosphere.
Carbon dioxide and oxygen provide basic
building blocl<s for plant life. Oxygen is used for
respiration- burning carbohydrates and other
foods to provide energy. Carbon dioxide must
be present during photosynthesis. Without C0 2
a plant will die. Carbon dioxide combines light
energy with water to produce sugars. These sugars fuel the growth and metabolism of the
plant. With reduced levels of C0 2, growth slows
to a crawl. Except during darkness, a plant
releases more oxygen than is used and uses
much more carbon dioxide than it releases.
Roots use air, too. Oxygen must be present
along with water and nutrients for the roots to
be able to absorb nutrients. Compacted, watersaturated soil leaves roots little or no air, and
nutrient uptake stalls.

Air Movement
Air ventilation and circulation are essential to a
healthy indoor harvest. Indoors, fresh air is one
of the most overlooked factors contributing to a

At least one good circulation fan and an extraction fan

healthy garden and a bountiful harvest. Fresh air
is the least expensive essential component
required to produce a bumper crop. Experienced
growers understand the importance of fresh air
and take the time to set up an adequate ventilation system. Three factors affect air movement:
stomata, ventilation, and circulation.

Stomata
Stomata are microscopic pores on leaf undersides that are similar to an animal's nostrils.
Animals regulate the amount of oxygen inhaled
and carbon dioxide and other elements exhaled
through the nostrils via the lungs. In cannabis,
oxygen and carbon dioxide flows are regulated
by the stomata. The larger the plant, the more
stomata it has to take in carbon dioxide and
release oxygen. The greater the volume of
plants, the more fresh CO~-rich air they will
need to grow quickly. Dirty, clogged stomata do
not work properly and restrict airflow. Stomata
are easily clogged by dirt from polluted air and
sprays that leave filmy residues. l<eep foliage
clean. To avoid clogging stomata, spray foliage
with tepid water a day or two after spraying with
pesticides, fungicides or nutrient solution.

Circulation

oscillating circulation fan. Air circulation also
helps prevent harmful pest and fungus attacks.
Omnipresent mold spores do not land and
grow as readily when air is stirred by a fan.
Insects and spider mites find it difficult to live in
an environment that is constantly bombarded
by air currents.

the used col -depleted

around the leaf. This stifles stomata and virtually
stops growth. If it is not
actively moved, the air
around leaves stratifies.
Warm air stays near the
ceiling, and cool air settles near the floor. Air circulation breaks up these
air masses, mixing them
together. Avoid these Microscopic stomata located on leaf undersides must remain clean ond

es, stomata function properly, and growth
rebounds. A vent fan that extracts air from the
grow room is the perfect solution to remove this
humid, stale air. Fresh air flows in through an
intake vent or with the help of an intake fan.
Ventilation is as important as water, light, heat,
and fertilizer. In many cases, fresh air is even
more important. Greenhouses use large ventilation fans. Grow rooms are very similar to greenhouses and should follow their example. Most
grow rooms have an easy-to-use opening, such
as a window in which to mount a fan, but security or room location may render it unusable. If
no vent opening is available, one will have to be
created.
All grow rooms require ventilation. This system
could be as simple as an open door or window
that supplies and circulates fresh air throughout
the room, but open doors and windows can be
inconvenient and problematic. Most growers

Ventilation
Fresh air is easy to obtain and inexpensive to
maintain-it is as si.mple as hooking up and
placing the proper-sized exhaust fan in the most
efficient location. An intake vent may be necessary to create a flow of fresh air in the room.
A 10-foot square (0.92 m2) garden will use
from 10 to 50 gallons (38 to 190L) or more of
water every week. Plants transpire (similar to
evaporation) most of this water into the air.
Every day and night, rapidly growing plants transpire more moisture into the air. If this moisture
is left in the grow room, humidity increases to
100 percent. which stifles stomata and causes
growth to screech to a halt. It also opens the
door for pest and disease attacks. Replace moist
air with fresh, dry air, and transpiration increas-

elect to install a vent fan. Some growers need to
install an entire ventilation system including
ductwork and several fans.
A vent fan pulls air out of a room four times
more efficiently than a fan is able to push it out.
Vent fans are rated by the amount of air, measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM) or (square
meters per hour [m~/h]) they can move. The fan
should be able to replace the air volume (length
x width x height = total volume in cubic feet)
of the grow room in less than 5 minutes. Once
evacuated, new air is immediately drawn in
through an intake vent or with the help of an
intake fan. (Covering the intake vent with fine
mesh silkscreen will help exclude pests.) An
intake fan might be necessary to bring an adequate volume of fresh air into the room quickly.
Some rooms have so many little cracks for air to
drift in that they do not need an intake vent.
Do not set up a circulation fan in the room and
expect it to vent the area by pushing air out a
distant vent. The circulation fan must be very
large to adequately increase air pressure and
push enough air out a vent to create an

exchange of air. A vent fan, on the other hand,
is able to change the pressure and exchange the
air quickly and efficiently.
Squirrel cage blowers are efficient at moving
air but are very loud. Blowers with a balanced,
well-oiled wheel run most quietly. Felt or rubber
grommets below each foot of the fan will
reduce noise caused by vibrations. Run motor at
a low RPM to lessen noise.
In-line fans are designed to fit into a duct pipe.
The propellers are mounted to increase the airflow quickly, effortl essly, and as quietly as possible. In-line fans are available in quiet, highquality models that run smoothly.
Propeller or muffin fans with large fan blades
expel air through a large opening, and are most
efficient and quiet when operated at low RPM.

Most often, the vent fan is attached to ducting
that directs air out of the grow room. Flexible
ducting is easier to use than rigid ducting. To
install, run the duct the shortest possible distance, and keep curves to a minimum. When
turned at more than 30°, much of the air that
enters a duct will not exit the other end. Keep
the ducting straight and short.

Intake air ducting has holes covered with duct tope.
Air flaw is directed by removing pieces of tope.

Fresh air in this room is piped in directly where
plants need it

Intake Air
Many rooms have enough fresh air coming in
via cracks and holes. But other grow rooms are
tightly sealed and require fresh air to be ushered
in with the help of an intake fan. An intake fan
is the same as an exhaust fan, except it blows
fresh air into the room. The ratio of 1 to 4 (1 00
CFM [m 3/h} incoming and 400 CFM (m'' /h] outgoing) should give the room a little negative
pressure. Delivering fresh air to plants ensures
they will have adequate co~ to continue rapid
growth. One of the best ways to deliver air
directly to plants is to pipe it in via flexible dueling. Ingenious growers cut holes in the intake
dueling to direct air where it is needed. The air
is dispersed evenly throughout the room.
Always make sure fresh air is neither too hot
nor too cold. For example, one friend that lives
in a hot, arid climate brings cool fresh air in from
under the house, where the air is a few degrees
cooler than ambient air.

Security

To control the air temperature, hang the thermostat

through them. By installing a big, slow-moving
vent fan in this vent, hot stale air is quietly and
efficiently evacuated. A fan running at 50 RPM is
quieter than one running at 200 RPM. Smart
growers install 12-inch ducting and inline fans.

When installing a vent fan, security concerns
dictate that no light or odor escape from the
exterior vent while allowing ample air release.
This can be accomplished in several ways. Baflle
~r turn the light around a corner to subdue brilliance. Many chimneys in British Columbia,
Canada, shoot light out like a spotlight against
the low cloud cover. You can walk down city
streets where half the chimneys in the neighborhood are beacons of bright light. A 4-inch {10.16
em) flexible dryer hose will subdue light in
smaller grow rooms. Larger 8, 10, and 12-inch
(20, 25, 30 em) heat duct pipe is ideal for moving larger volumes of air.

Place one end of the duct outdoors. It should
be high enough, preferably over 12 feet, so the
odor disperses above most people's heads. One
of the best vents is the chimney. The outlet may
be camouflaged by using a dryer hose wall outlet attached to a vent fan. The vent fan is then
placed near the ceiling so it vents hot, humid air.
Check for light and air leaks. Set up the fan and
go outdoors after dark to inspect for light leaks.
See below: "Setting Up the Vent Fan" and
"Odor:'
Greenhouse fans are equipped with louvers
(flaps or baffles) to prevent backdrafts. During
cold and hot weather, undesirable backdrafts
could alter the climate in the room and usher in
a menagerie of pests and diseases. Installing a
vent fan with louvers eliminates backdrafts, but
may present a security risk if it attracts the attention of the wrong crowd.

Under normal conditions, the ideal temperature range for indoor growth is 72-76°F (22240C). At night, the temperature can drop 5100F (2-s•q with little noticeable effect on
growth rate. The temperature should not drop
more than l5°F (8°C), or excessive humidity
and mold might become problems. Daytime
temperatures above 85"F (29°C) or below 60°F
(15"C) will slow growth. Maintaining the prop-

Temperature
An accurate thermometer is essential to measure temperature in all grow rooms. Mercury or
liquid thermometers are typically more accurate
than spring or dial types, but ecologically
unsound. An inexpensive thermometer will collect basic information, but the ideal thermometer is a day-night or maximum/minimum type
that measures how low the temperature drops
at night and how high it reaches during the day.
The maximum and minimum temperatures in a
grow room are important for the reasons
explained below.

er, constant temperature in the grow room promotes strong, even, healthy growth. Make sure
plants are not too close to a heat source, like a
ballast or heat vent, or they may dry out, maybe
even get heat scorch. Cold intake air will also
stunt plant growth.
Cannabis regulates its oxygen uptake in relation to the ambient air temperature rather than
the amount of available oxygen. Plants use a lot
of oxygen; in fact, a plant cell uses as much oxygen as a human cell. The air must contain at
least 20 percent oxygen for plants to thrive.
l eaves are not able to make oxygen at night, but
roots still need oxygen to grow. A plant's respiration rate approximately doubles every 2o•F

(JO•C). Root respiration increases as the roots
warm up, which is why fresh air is important
both day and night.
Temperatures above as•F (29°C) are not recommended even when using co, enrichment.
Under the proper conditions, which are very
demanding to maintain, higher temperatures
step up metabolic activity and speed growth.
The warmer it is, the more water the air is able
to hold. This moist air often restrains plant functions and decelerates growth rather than speeding it. Other complications and problems result
from excess humidity and moisture condensation when the temperature drops at night.
Heat buildup during warm weather can catch
growers off guard and cause serious problems.
Ideal grow rooms are located underground, in a
base.1~ent, taking advantage of the insulating
qualities of Mother Earth. With the added heat
of the HID and hot, humid weather outdoors, a
room can heat up rapidly. More than a few
American growers have lost their crops to heat
stroke during the Fourth of July weekend, since
it is the first big holiday of the summer, and
everybody in the city wants to get away to enjoy
it. There are always some gardeners that forget
or are too paranoid to maintain good ventilation
in the grow room while on vacation.
Temperatures can easily climb to Joo•F (38°C)
or more in grow rooms that are poorly insulated
and vented. The hotter it is, the more ventilation
and water that are necessary.
The cold of winter is the other temperature
extreme. Montreal, Quebec, Canada, growers
will remember the year of the big ice storm.
Electricity went out all over the city and sur~ounding areas. Water pipes froze, and heating
systems failed. Residents were driven from their
homes until electricity was restored some days
later. Many growers returned to find their beautiful gardens wilted, stricken with the deepest,
most disgusting green only a freeze can bring.
Broken water pipes, ice everywhere! It is difficult
to combat such acts of God, but if possible,
always keep the grow room above 40°F (5°C)
and definitely above freezing, 32°F (0°C). If the

temperature dips below this mark, the freeze
will rupture plant cells, and foliage will die back
or, at best, grow slowly. Growth slows when the
temperature dips below SO"F (1 O"C). Stressing
plants with cold weather conditions is not recommended; it may yield a proportionately higher THC content, but will reduce plants' overall
productivity.
A thermostat measures the temperature, then
controls it by turning on or off a device that regulates heating or cooling, keeping the temperature within a predetermined range. A thermostat
can be attached to an electric or combustion
heater. In fact, many homes are already setup
with electric baseboard heat and a thermostat in
each room.
A thermostat can be used to control cooling
vent fans in all but the coldest grow rooms.
When it gets too hot in a room, the thermostat
turns on the vent fan, which evacuates the hot
stale air. The vent fan remains on until the
desired temperature is reached, then the thermostat turns off the fan. A thermostat-controlled
vent fan offers adequate temperature and
humidity control for many grow rooms. A refrigerated air conditioner can be installed if heat
and humidity are a major problem. Just remember, air conditioners draw a lot of electricity. If
excessive heat is a problem, but humidity is not
a concern, use a swamp cooler. These evaporative coolers are inexpensive to operate and keep
rooms cool in arid climates.
Common thermostats include single-stage and
two-stage. The single-stage thermostat controls a
device that keeps the temperature the same
both day and night. A two-stage thermostat is
more expensive but can be set to maintain different daytime and nighttime temperatures. This
convenience can save money on heating, since
room temperature can drop 5-l O"F (2-S"C) at
night with little effect on growth.
Many new grow room controllers have been
developed in the last ten years. These controllers can operate and integrate every appliance in the grow room. More sophisticated controllers integrate the operation of co~ equip-

C0 2 Enrichment

Carbon dioxide (COl) is a colorless, odorless,
non-flammable gas that is around us all the
time. The air we breathe contains 0.03-0.04 percent COl . Rapidly growing cannabis can use all
of the available COl in an enclosed grow room
within a few hours. Photosynthesis and growth
slow to a crawl when the C0 2 level falls below
0.02 percent.
Carbon dioxide enrichment has been used in
commercial greenhouses for more than 35
years. Adding more C0 2 to grow room air stimulates growth. Indoor cannabis cultivation is
similar to conditions in a greenhouse, and
indoor growers apply the same principles.
Cannabis can use more CO, than the 0.03-0.04
percent (300-400 ppm) that naturally occurs in
the air. By increasing the amount of C02 to

when it rises above 5000 ppm and can become

CO,• enrichment becomes ineffective, and at
90"F (32"C) growth stops.
Carbon dioxide-enriched plants use more
water. Water rises from plant roots and is
released into the air by the same stomata the
plant uses to absorb C0 2 during transpiration.
Carbon dioxide enrichment affects transpiration
by causing the plants' stomata to partially close.
This slows down the loss of water vapor into the
air. Foliage on C0 2-enriched plants is measurably thicker, more turgid, and slower to wilt than
leaves on non-enriched plants.
Carbon dioxide affects plant morphology. In an
enriched growing environment, stems and
branches grow faster, and the cells of these
plant parts are more densely packed. Flower
sterns carry more weight without bending.
Because of the increased rate of branching,

cannabis has more flower initiation sites. Plants
that sometimes do not bear from the first flower
set are more likely to set flowers early if C01
enrichment is used.
With C01-enriched air, plants that do not have
the support of the other critical elements for life
will not benefit at all, and the C0 2 is wasted. The
plant can be limited by just one of the critical
factors. For example, the plants use water and
nutrients a lot faster, and if they are not supplied, the plants will not grow. They might even
be stunted.
To be most effective, the C02 level must be
maintained at 1000 to 1500 ppm everywhere in
the room. To accomplish this, the grow room
must be completely enclosed. Cracks in and
around the walls should be sealed off to prevent
C01 from escaping. Enclosing the room mal<es it
easier to control the col content of the air within. The room must also have a vent fan with
flaps or a baffle. The vent fan will remove the
stale air that will be replaced with CO,-enriched

air. The flaps or baffle will help contain the co,
in the enclosed grow room. Venting requirements will change with each type of CO,-enrichment system and are discussed below.

Measuring C02

Measuring and monitoring C02 levels in the air
is rather expensive and often unnecessary for
small growers. Monitoring C02 levels in grow
rooms with ten or more lights really helps keep
the levels consistent.
Disposable comparative colorimetry C0 2 test
kits are easy to use, accurate, and inexpensive.
The test kits contain a syringe and test tubes and
sell for about $30. To use the kit, break off each
end tip of the test tube, and insert one end into
the closed syringe. Pull l 00 cubic centimeters
into the syringe, and note the blue color change
in the cylinder where the active ingredient reacts
with the C0 2 in the air drawn through the cylinder. These kits are reliable to within 40 ppm.
Electrochemical sensing systems measure
electrical conductivity of an air sample in either
an alkali solution or distilled or de-ionized water.
TI1ese systems are relatively inexpensive, but
they have drawbacks: limited accuracy and sensitivity to temperature and air pollutants.
Infrared monitoring systems are more accurate
and versatile. They correctly measure co, and
can be synchronized with controllers that operate heat, ventilation, and C02 generators. Even
though the initial cost for a monitor is high, they
can solve many C01 problems before they occur
and can ensure optimum growing conditions.
Specialty indoor garden stores sell the monitors
for less than $1000.
.Growers who do not want to spend the time
and energy required to monitor C02 can use a
set of scales and simple mathematics to determine the approximate amount of C02 in the air,
but this calculation does not account for ventilation, air leaks, and other things that could skew
the measurement. It is easier to measure the
amount of C02 produced rather than to measure the amount of C0 2 in the grow room's
atmosphere.

To measure the amount of fuel used, simply
weigh the tank before it is turned on, use it for
an hour, and then weigh it again. The difference
in weight is the amount of gas or fuel used. See
the calculations below for more information on
calculating the amount of co, in the room.

Producing C02

There are many ways to raise the C02 content
of an enclosed grow room. The two most popular ways are to disperse it from a tank or burn
a fuel to manufacture it. Carbon dioxide is one
of the byproducts of combustion. Growers can
burn any fossil (carbon-based) fuel to produce
C0 2 except for those containing sulfur dioxide
and ethylene, which are harmful to plants.
Carbon dioxide gas is a by-product of fermentation and organic decomposition. The C0 7 level
near the ground of a rain forest covered with
decaying organic matter could be two to three
times as high as normal, but bringing a compost
pile inside to cook down is not practical. Dry ice
is made from frozen COl. The C0 2 is released
when dry ice comes in contact with the atmosphere. It can get expensive and be a lot of trouble to keep a large room constantly supplied
with dry ice. It is difficult to calculate how much
C02 is released into the air by fermentation,
decomposition, or dry ice without purchasing
expensive equipment.

C02 Emitter Systems

Compressed C0 2 systems are virtually risk-free,
producing no toxic gases, heat, or water. These
systems are also precise, metering an exact
amount of CO,• into the room. Carbon dioxide is
metered out of a cylinder of the compressed gas
using a regulator, flow meter, a solenoid valve,
and a short-range timer. Two types of systems
are: continuous flow and short range. Metal carbon dioxide cylinders which hold the gas under
1000 to 2200 pounds of pressure per square
inch (psi) (depending upon temperature) can
be purchased from welding or beverage supply
stores. The cylinders are often available at

hydroponic stores. In North America, cylinders
come in three sizes: 20, 35, and 50 pounds {9,
16, and 23 kg), and average between $100 and
$200 (with refills costing about $30). Tanks must
be inspected annually and registered with a
nationwide safety agency. Welding suppliers and
beverage suppliers often require identification
such as a driver's license. Most suppliers
exchange tanks and refill them. Fire extinguisher companies and beverage supply companies
normally fill C0 2 tanks on the spot. If you purchase a lighter and stronger aluminum tank,
make sure to request an aluminum tank
exchange. Remember, the tank you buy is not
necessarily the one you keep. To experiment
before purchasing equipment, rent a 50-pound
(23 kg) tank. A large 50-pound (23 kg) cylinder
is heavier but saves you the time of returning to
the store to have it refilled. When full, a 50pound steel tank weighs 170 pounds (77 kg). A
full 20-pound (9 kg) steel tank weighs 70
pounds (32 kg) and might be too heavy to carry
up and down stairs. A full 20-pound (9 kg) aluminum tank weighs about 50 pounds (23 kg),
and a full 35-pound {16 kg) tank weights 75
pounds (34 kg). Make sure COl tanks have a
protective collar on top to shield the valve. If the

Compressed C0 2 is expensive, especially in
large grow shows. At roughly $0.50 per pound
(450 gm), compressed gas is much more
expensive than fuels used in generators. Cost of
equipment and fuel make compressed col
enrichment systems less economical than generators.

C02 Generator Systems

C01 generators are used by commercial
flower, vegetable, and marijuana growers. Green
Air Products has introduced a complete line of
reasonably priced C02 generators that burn natural gas or LP (propane) to produce C0 2•
However, heat and water are by-products of the
combustion process. Generators use a pilot light
with a flow meter and burner. The inside of the
generator is similar to a gas stove burner with a
pilot light enclosed in a protective housing. The
generator must have a cover over the open
flame. You can operate the generators manually
or synchronize them with a timer to operate
with other grow room equipment such as ventilation fans.
col generators produce hot exhaust gasses
(C02 + H1 0). Even though C0 2 is heavier than
air, it is hotter and therefore less dense and rises
in a garden room. You must have good air circulation for even distribution of CO,.
Carbon Dioxide generators can burn any fossil
fuel-kerosene, propane, or natural gas. Low
grades of kerosene can have sulfur content as
high as 0.01 of 1 percent, enough to cause sulfur dioxide pollution. Use only high-quality
kerosene even though it is expensive. Always
use grade "1 -K" kerosene. Maintenance costs for
kerosene generators are high, because they use
electrodes, pumps, and fuel filters. For most
grow rooms, propane and natural gas burners
are the best choice.
When filling a new propane tank, first empty it
of the inert gas which is used to protect it from
rust. Never completely fill a propane tank.
Propane expands and contracts with temperature change and could release flammable gas
from the pressure vent if too full.

CO, generators produce carbon dioxide by burning LP
or propane gas. They also generate heat and water
vapor as by-products.

Spray soapy water around all propane gas connections to check for bubbles (leaks).

Generators burn either propane or natural gas,
but must be set up for one or the other. They are
inexpensive to maintain and do not use filters or
pumps. Hobby C02 generators range from $300
to S500, depending on size. The initial cost of a
generator is slightly higher than a col emitter
system that uses small, compressed-gas cylinders. Nonetheless, growers prefer propane and
natural gas generators, because they are about
four times less expensive to operate than bottled C0 2 generators. One gallon of propane,
which costs about $2, contains 36 cubic feet of
gas and over 100 cubic feet of C0 2 (every cubic
foot of propane gas produces 3 cubic feet of
CO,). For example, if a garden used one gallon
of propane every day, the cost would be about

1 pound of C02 displaces 8.7 cubic feet (246 cm 3) of C0 2.
0.3 pound (0.135 kg) of fuel produces 1 pound (454 gm) of C02.
Divide the total amount of C0 2 needed by 8.7 and multiply by 0.33 to determine the amount of
fuel needed. In our example on pages 18-19, we found we need 1 cubic foot of C0 2 for an 800
cubic foot garden room.
L x W x H = room volume (cubic feet)
12 x 14 x 8 = 1344 cubic feet (38 m3)

$60 per month. In contrast, bottled C02 for the
same room would cost more than $200 per
month!
co, generators are less expensive to maintain
and less cumbersome, but they have some disadvantages, too. One pound of fuel produces
1.5 pounds of water and 21,800 Btu of heat. For
grow rooms less than 400 cubic feet, this makes
generators unusable. Even for larger garden
rooms, the added heat and humidity must be
carefully monitored and controlled so as not to
affect plants. Growers in warm climates do not
use generators, because they produce too much
heat and humidity.
lf fuel does not burn completely or cleanly,
C02 generators can release toxic gases-including carbon monoxide- into the grow room.

Nitrous oxide, also a byproduct of burning
propane, can grow to toxic levels, too. Wellmade C02 generators have a pilot and timer. If
leaks or problems are detected, the pilot and
timer will turn off.
A C02 monitor is necessary if you are sensitive
to high levels of the gas. Digital alarm units or
color change plates (used in aircraft) are an economical alternative. Carbon monoxide is a
deadly gas and can be detected with a carbon
monoxide alarm available at most hardware
and building supply stores.
Check homemade generators frequently,
including kerosene or gas heaters. Propane and
natural gas produce a blue flame when burning
efficiently. A yellow flame means unburned gas
(which creates carbon monoxide) and needs

more oxygen to burn cleanly. Leaks in a system
can be detected by applying a solution of equal
parts water and concentrated dish soap to all
connections. If bubbles appear, gas is leaking.
Never use a leaky system.
Oxygen is also burned. As it becomes deficient
in the room, the oxygen/fuel mixture changes.
The flame burns too rich and yellows. This is
why fresh air is essential.
Turn off co,. generators at night. They create
excess heat and humidity in the grow room,
and they need oxygen to operate. At night, roots
need the extra oxygen in the room for continued growth.
If you are using C0 1 and the yield does not
increase, check to make sure the entire grow
room is running properly and that plants have
the proper light and nutrient levels, as well as
the correct temperature, humidity, grow-medium moisture, and pH. Make sure roots receive
enough oxygen both day and night.

Other Ways
to Make C02
There are many ways to make C01. You can
enrich small areas by burning ethyl or methyl
alcohol in a kerosene lamp. Norwegians are
studying charcoal burners as a source of co,.
When refined, the system will combine the
advantages of generators and compressed gas.
Charcoal is much less expensive than bottled
CO, and is less risky than generators in terms of
toxic by-products. Others are studying the use of
new technology to extract or filter CO, from the
a1r.
This little inexpensive puck called Excellofizz
<www.feadessgardener.com) releases col into
the atmosphere. It is simple to use; just add a
few ounces of water and a puck or two to cause
a chemical reaction that will disperse enough
col to augment the air in a 10-foot-square {9

odors. Make sure to keep the fizz contained, and
if using an ozone generator, keep the lamp clean.

Compost and Organic Growing
Mediums
Decomposing organic materials like wood
chips, hay, leaves, and manures release large
amounts of C01. Although you can capture C01
from this decomposition, it is most often
impractical for indoor growers. Piping indoors
the co, and fumes from a compost pile is complicated, expensive, and more work than it is
worth.

Fermentation
Small-scale growers use fermentation to produce co,. Combine water, sugar, and yeast to
produce C0 2• The yeast eats the sugar and
releases col and alcohol as by-products.
Growers who brew beer at home can use a
small-scale system to increase the CO, levels in
a room. Non-brewers can mix one cup of sugar,
a packet of brewer's yeast, and three quarts of
warm water in a gallon jug to make C0 1. You
will have to experiment a little with the water
temperature to get it right. Yeast dies in hot
water and does not activate in cold water. Once
the yeast is activated, CO, is released into the air
in bursts. Punch a small hole in the cap of the
jug, and place it in a warm spot {80 to 95°F [26
to 3i.J 0 C)) in your grow room. Many gardeners

Odor
A good exhaust fan, vented outdoors, is the
first step in cannabis odor control and the easiest way to keep the house from reeking of fresh
marijuana. If the odor is strong and venting is a
problem, a negative ion generator (deionizer);
deodorizing liquid, gel. puck, or spray; ozone
generator; activated charcoal filter; or a combination of two or more of these will solve fragrance problems.

Deodorizers
Kill odors by changing their structure at the
molecular level. Products such as Odor Killer'".
Ona"'. VaporTel<""', and Ozium,.", are made from
essential oils that kill odors by creating a neutral
atmosphere at the atomic level. Such products
are usually available in gel and spray. Many
growers prefer to use the gel over the long term
and spray for emergency situations, such as
when unexpected guests stop by during harvest.
The deodorizers can be set out in the room,
around the house, and near doorways. Several
companies offer products that stick to the wall.
One ingenious grower I interviewed stuck one
such deodori zing puck to the inside of the front
door, just below the mail slot to keep the house
fresh. Other produ cts are designed to be
attached to the ventilation ductwork system.
Often these products are used not only to alter
the odor of marijuana, but also to alter the telltale odor produced by an ozone generator.
Other companies offer aerosol spray cans with a
dispenser that periodically meters out a burst of
spray.

Negative ion generators are small and somewhat efficient to control odors, smoke, airborne
pollen, mold, dust, and static electricity. They
pump negative ions into the atmosphere. The
negative ions are attracted to positive ions containing odors and other airborne pollutants. The

negative ions attach to positive ions, and the
odor becomes neutralized. The particles fall to
the floor and create a fine covering of dust on
the ground, walls, and objects in the room.
These devices work fairly well for small grow
rooms with minimal odor problems. The generator uses very little electricity and plugs into a
regular 115-volt current. Visually check the filter
every few days, and make sure to keep it clean.

Ozone Generators

Fan with deodorizer

Ozone has many applications including food
and water sterilization and removing odors from
the air at the molecular level. Some growers
even use high levels of ozone to exterminate
grow room pests.
Ozone generators neutralize odors by converting oxygen (02) into ozone (03) by exposing the
stinky air to ultraviolet (UV) light. The extra molecule is always a positively charged ion that is
predisposed to attach to a negatively charged
ion (cation). Odors are negatively charged
cations. When the extra oxygen ion attaches to
the cation, they neutralize one another and the
odor, too. Once the extra molecule is shed, 0 3 is
converted back into 0 2• The chemistry takes a
minute or longer to occur, so treated air must be
held in a chamber to be converted effectively.
Ozone has an unusual odor similar to the
smell of the air after a good rain. Anybody who

has ever smelled the air in a room recently treated with ozone knows the smell and will never
forget it. Make sure not to produce too much
ozone, and give it enough time to mix with
smelly air to neutralize odors. The distinctive
odor of excess ozone exiting a building will tip
off narcs and thieves. For this reason, many
growers also use a carbon filter to further scrub
the air.
There are many ozone generators available.
When shopping for an ozone generator, look for
one that has been on the market for a few years
and has an established track record. Watch for
important features such as self-cleaning (or easy
to clean} and easy, safe bulb replacement.
When UV light encounters moisture in the air,
nitric acid is produced as a byproduct. This
white, powdery nitric acid collects around the
lamps at connection points. This is an unpleasant, very corrosive acid that will severely burn
skin and eyes. Verify that the ozone generator
has proper safety features built in, such as a
switch that turns off the lamp for maintenance,
making it impossible to look at the retina-searing uv rays. Legal exposure for humans is about
o. 1 ppm for a maximum of 8 hours. Most grow
room ozone generators produce about 0.05
ppm at timed intervals. See below for plant
symptoms of ozone overdose.

impossible. Highly corrosive ozone stays away
from interior wiring, and little moisture can penetrate the outer shell to combine with 0 3 to
form powdery nitric acid.
Ozone generators are rated by the number of
cubic feet (m3} they are able to treat. (To figure
cubic feet or meters, multiply the length x width
x height of the room}. Some growers setup the
ozone generator in the grow room and let it treat
all the air in the room. TI1ey add a timer so the
ozone generator intermittently disperses ozone
into the room to maintain a relatively constant
level. This practice can diminish the fragrance of
the bud. Smart growers set up an ozone generator in a spare closet or build an ozone exchange
chamber and route fragrant grow room air

through the closet for ozone treatment before
being evacuated outdoors. Other growers set up
the ozone generator in ventilation ductwork to
treat air before it exits. Once generated, ozone
has a life of about 30 minutes. It takes a minute
or two for the 0 3 molecules to combine with
oxygen to neutralize odors.
Ozone damage
For best results, keep the ozone generator in
another room or isolated from the growing
plants. Ozone causes chlorotic spots on leaves.
The mottled spots that appear at first to be a Mg
deficiency, increase in size and turn dark in the
process. Most often, the symptoms are found on
foliage near the generator. Leaves wither and
drop, and overall plant growth slows to a crawl.

Activated Carbon Filters

A vent-fan duct hooks to each tube, and the air·
cleansing agent is imported before air is evacuated.

Ozone generators are located inside ducting. Grow
room air mixes with ozone in dueling and big metal
box. Air smells fresh and clean once treated properly
with ozone.

Activated charcoal filters are fantastic, and they
work! The charcoal is "activated" with oxygen,
which opens millions of pores in the carbon.
The activated charcoal absorbs odor molecules
and other pollutants in the air. The mechanics
are simple, and there are three important things
to remember when using a charcoal filter. First,
keep room humidity below 55 percent. At about
65 to 70 percent relative humidity, the charcoal
absorbs moisture and clogs. At 80 percent
humidity, it stops removing odors. Second, air
must move slowly through charcoal filters to
extract odors. The fan on professional units lets
just enough air through the filter so the odors
have enough (dwell) time to be absorbed by

Ozone con severely damage foliage. This is what it
does to foliage.

encases porous dueling surrounded by activated charcoal. These filters are efficient until humidity climbs beyond
60 percent, or which point moisture-filled charcoal foils to absorb.

the carbon filter. Third, use a pre-filter. The prefilter catches most of the dust and airborne pollutants before they foul the carbon filter. Change
the pre-filter regularly- every 60 days, or more
often if the room is dusty. Carbon lasts about a
year. Many growers prefer activated carbon
made from coco. Do not use activated carbon
that is "crushed," because it is less efficient than
charcoal pellets.
Install an intake screen that filters out large
particles of dust to prolong the life of the activated charcoal filter. Whether the intake is passive or brought in by a fan, use a filter for incoming air to minimize pollutants in the grow room.
Check with filter manufacturers or retailers
about venting specifications for your grow area.
A more powerful exhaust fan will be necessary
to draw an adequate volume of air through the
activated charcoal filter. An adequate airflow is
imperative to keep a high col content in the
grow room a1r.

Setting Up the Vent Fan - Step-by-Step
Step One: Figure the total volume of the grow
room. Length x width x height = total volume. For
example, a grow room that is 10 x 10 x 8 feet
(21 .5 ml ) has a total volume of 800 cubic feet ( 10
x 10 x 8 feet = 800 cubicfeet (21.5 m2) . A room

measuring 4 x 5 x 2 meters has a total volume of
40 cubic meters.
Step 1\No: Use a vent fan that will remove the
total volume of air in the room in less than five
minutes. Buy a fan that can easily be mounted on
the wall or "in line" in a duct pipe. Quality "in line"
fans move much air and make very little noise. It's
worth spending the extra money on an "in line"
fan. Small rooms can use a fan that can be
attached to a flexible 4-inch (12 em) dryer hose.
Many stores sell special ducting to connect highspeed squirrel cage fans with the 4-inch (12 em)
ducting.
Step Three: Place the fan high on a wall or near
the ceiling of the grow room so it vents off hot,
humid air.

using a large hose clamp or duct tape.

This chapter explains the basic biological
processes of sexual propagation in cannabis and
the formation of a new generation of seed.
Armed with the information in this chapter, any
grower will be able to design and begin a rudi mentary breeding program and create new generations of seed for future use. These new populations make up a pool of genetic material
from which superior individual plants can be
selected for production (cloning stock) or for
use in breeding programs. It is difficult for small
growers to breed better varieties than are available from premium seed companies; however,
for the many seed-starved growers who reside
in prohibitive societies, making seeds for future
use is often a necessity.
'Cannabis can be reproduced asexually or sexually. Asexual propagation is more commonly
referred to as taking cuttings, or cloning.
Branches or growth shoots are removed from
chosen donor plants and induced to form roots
in a separate medium; these rooted cuttings are
then used to plant a uniform crop of genetically
identical individuals. Most commercial and

many hobby growers propagate their crops
asexually to ensure uniformity in growth, yield,
and consistency of product in their crops. By
planting gardens of genetically identical cuttings
from their favorite pre-selected mother plants,
growers are able to maintain an even garden
profile, produce a consistent, l<nown quality and
quantity from each plant, and expect that all
plants will mature at the same time. This
ensures the same consistent, quality product
from consecutive crops, as long as the same
high-quality clones are used for each planting.
Gardens propagated solely from clones are the
most productive and consistent.
Sexual propagation is the process in which
male and female sex cells (gametes) from separate parents unite in the female plant to form
what will eventually mature into a new, genetically distinct individual. This process occurs
when pollen from a male (staminate) parent
unites with an ovule within the ovary of a
female flower to create an embryo. This
embryo, when mature and fully developed, will
become a seed.
Each seed is genetically unique and contains
some genes from each of its parent plants.
Offspring grown from seed are most often different in some way from each other, just as
brothers and sisters share some physical qualities of each of their parents, but are rarely identical to their parents or siblings. Because of this
variation in plant traits and characters, breeders
are able to use sexual reproduction to their
advantage by crossing different individuals within a population or family, or hybridizing unrelated lines and subsequently inbreeding the progeny. This results in a phenomenon known as
recombination of traits, and it allows breeders
the possibility to recover individuals with a combination of the positive traits of both parental
lines, all the while selecting plants that do not
express the negative aspects. These selected
plant stocks are then used as a basis to develop
new and improved varieties.

A single male flower on a predominately female
plant will release mttch pol/on.

I ~'

Female plants grow (white) pistils to attract
male pollen.

Distinguishing between male (staminate)
and female (pistillate) plants is easy. Male
plants are distinguished by the appearance of
''pollen sacks," or anthers, that grow from
branch unions. Anthers look similar to a cluster of grapes or a collection of miniature lobster claws growing upwards and inverted
from the branch union. Males typically begin
to produce these flowers one to four weeks
before the females of the same variety, and
often bolt, or stretch, when they enter their
floral development stage. Females can be distinguished by the development of two whitish
hairs, or stigmas, which develop as part of the
pistil- the female fl ower that appears in
branch unions or "nodes."
Cannabis is an interesting species, in that it
is one of the only annual plants that produces
each of the male and female sexual organs on
different individuals. This is a condition
known as dioecy; dioecious plant groups contain individual plants that are either male (staminate; stamen bearing) or female (pistillate;
pistil bearing). Dioecy is a hallmark of a crosspollinating species; under normal conditions,
cross-pollinated plants (outcrossers) are only
able to fertilize other individuals, which has
implications we will discuss later.
Although dioecy is most common in
cannabis, monoecious varieties do exist.
Monoecious varieties produce both staminate
and pistillate flowers on the same individual.

These monoecious varieties are mainly used
for hemp seed production, as they generate
the highest yield of seed per acre. Monoecy is
not a desirable trait for drug cultivation, where
seedless cannabis, or sinsemilla, is sought.
Plants exhibiting both staminate and pistillate flowers are most often referred to as "hermaphrodites" by drug cannabis cultivators but
are more correctly referred to as intersex
plants. Intersex plants are a problem for growers who wish to produce seedless cannabis
for consumption; just as seedless grapes or
oranges are more desirable to consume, the
same is true for cannabis. Having to remove
the seeds from cannabis flowers prior to consumption is an inconvenience, and burning
seeds taste bad and can ruin the smoking or
vaporizing experience. We will discuss intersex plants in more detail later in the chapter.

The creation of a seed
Cannabis is an anemophilous species; this is
a fancy way of saying that it is wind-pollinated. Under natural, or wild, conditions, male
plants undergo dehiscence (shedding of
pollen) and disperse vast quantities of pollen
into the wind. The pollen travels on air currents and, by chance, lands on the stigma or
style of a nearby, or not so nearby, pistillate
individual. This is the pollination event.
Because pollen from many species floats in
the air, and there is a significant chance that

pollen from other species will
land on a fertile stigma of a waiting female plant, cannabis has
evolved recognition systems that
insure only species-specific
pollen is able to germina te on
the style and thus fertilize the
female's ovules. There is physical
and biochemical recognition
between the pollen grain and
the stigmatic surface; together,
these insure species identity.
If the biochemical signal is correct and the stigma recognizes
the pollen grain as cannabis, the
pollen grain is hydrated by a
flow of water from the pistil, and
it germinates. Just as a seed germinates and sends a taproot into
the soil, the pollen grain germinates and sends a pollen tube
into the stigma and burrows
toward the ovule. Once the tube
reaches the ovary, the genetic
material carried within pollen is
delivered to the ovule, where it is
united with the genetic material
from the pistillate plant. This fertilization event occurs and creates what is to become an
embryo. This embryo grows
within a seed coat, and when

determine the positive and negative characters
of each plant, for its growth as well as its smoking characteristics. Post-harvest evaluation
allows additional inspection of aromas and flavors, since these can change as the flower dries
and cures.
·
Choosing male plants with desirable characteristics is not so easy. Males obviously don't
produce female flowers; thus, judging resin content, floral stature, smells, etc. is more of an
inferential task- males just don't demonstrate
these characters. Some breeders feel a good
method for choosing a.potential male is to rub
the stem with your finger. The idea is if it exudes
a pungent, resinous odor, it may be a good
plant. This is really only a crude measure of the
odor of the candidate. Although it can be a useful technique, it certainly should not be the
major selection criteria.
The best method for determining a potential
male's contribution as a breeding parent is the

progeny test. Progeny testing is achieved by taking pollen from a potential breeding male and
using it to make seeds with the chosen
female(s). The resulting seed population is
grown out and examined to determine the
effect of the male on the progeny. Progeny tests
are without doubt the most reliable method for
determining the genetic value of the chosen
male as a contributor to the next generation- a
concept known as combining ability. One drawback of the progeny test is that it takes time to
grow and evaluate the progeny, and the potential male plants must be kept alive if they are to
be used again. Sometimes breeders choose to
not keep these males alive, only keeping the
progeny lots that correspond to the better male
plants and destroying the rest. Only the bestperforming males are allowed to make a genetic contribution to the next generation.
Step Two: Collecting pollen. One branch of
male flowers will supply all the pollen necessary
for small-scale breeders to produce ample seed

for their own use. Strip away other branches to
guard against accidental random pollination,
and to avoid premature pollination, isolate the
male as soon as anthers show. Be considerate
of the fact that airborne pollen can travel miles.
If you brush up against a plant in dehiscence,
pollen will become airborne and travel throughout the area.
Just prior to the anther's opening, place a
clean paper or plastic bag over the branch.
Secure the bag at the bottom with a piece of
string or a wire tie to prevent pollen from escaping. Keep the bag over the branch for several
days to collect pollen. When enough pollen
seems to have been collected, tap the branch
'
and shake remaining pollen off into the bag.
Carefully remove spent branch and bag so the
pollen does not escape.
Step Three: Store and protect pollen (optional). Pollen does not have a long shelf life under
natural conditions; it is easily destroyed by high
temperatures and moisture. Pollen can, however, be stored in the freezer for several months, if
needed. This is accomplished by carefully
removing the pollen from the collection bag and
subsequently passing it through a screen. This
removes any leaf matter from the anthers that
may have fallen into the bag and contaminated
the pollen, causing it to spoil. Wax paper is
placed under the screen, and used to catch the
pollen. The pollen can then be collected with a

or sterile test tube, and placed in the freezer.
Cleanliness counts! Pollen should not be
repeatedly frozen and thawed, which will
decrease its viability.
Step Four: Pollination. Pollination occurs
when pollen comes into contact with the pistil.
Depending on variety, fresh pistils are ready to
pollinate from two to twelve weeks after flowering is induced. The more pistils on the bud at
the time of pollination, the more seed will be
produced. Fertile pistils appear turgid and most
often are white or off-white in color. Pistils that
are withered, rust- or brown-colored are past
the point where successful pollination can
occur.
To pollinate, cover the female branch with the
pollen filled bag, and briefly shake the bag to
ensure the pollen comes into contact with as
many pistils as possible. Leave the bag for two
days and nights to ensure thorough pollination.
Be careful not to scatter pollen when removing
the bag, as viable pollen can still become airborne and pollinate any nearby plants. If other
plants are in the garden and are not intended

for pollination, the grower may move target
plants from the main grow area into a separate,
smaller space for pollination. After a couple days
in the pollen chamber with the males, the
female plants are thoroughly sprayed with
water to destroy any remaining pollen, before
they are moved back into the main grow area
where these seeds will mature over the coming
weeks. This practice minimizes the possibility of
pollen fertilizing the rest of the crop, keeping it
seedless as the cultivator requires. To reduce or
eliminate pollen contamination of future seed
crops, make sure to clean the pollination chamber between each pollen release.
An alternate approach is to use a small paint
brush to "paint" pollen onto the pistils. Dip the

brush in the pollen container and gently brush
the pollen onto the pistils. Again, the breeder
must have a steady hand to ensure pollen doesn't become airborne during the process. This
technique is perfect if the cultivator only needs
to make a few seeds.
After fertilization, most seeds will be fully ripe
in about six weeks, although some may be
viable earlier. As the seeds mature, they can split
open the calyxes allowing the breeder to see
the development of the seed within. Seeds are
ripe when they are mostly dark brown or grey,
well-mottled (tiger striped), and sitting loosely
in the calyx. Green, yellow, or white seeds are
almost always immature and not viable.
(Sprinkle them on your salad or cereal.) To test
the ripeness of the seed crop, you can sample·
harvest a few seeds and try to press them
between your thumb and index finger to test
the firmness. If most of the seeds do not crush
with a reasonable amount of pressure, it's time
to harvest. If seeds are left on the plant too long,
some may fall out of the buds and germinate on
the growth medium below. This is more common with sativa-dominant varieties. Indica varieties typically have more dense flowers, which
hold the seeds more tightly. Breeders must
remove seeds from indicas by crushing and
sorting the seeds from the plant matter.
Seeds are ready to plant immediately, but the
initial germination rates may be low.
Germination rates can be increased by drying
seeds out post harvest, leaving them in a cool,
dark, well-ventilated area for a few weeks, and
then placing them in the refrigerator for one or
two months before sprouting.

Please keep in mind this is only a guideline
intended for small-scale seed production. Any
method where pollen comes into contact with a
pistil will result in seeds. Often breeders and
seedmakers will place multiple males, or multiple copies of the same male (clones from a
father donor plant) in the seed production grow

seeds. Placing these males in a well-ventilated
room and allowing full release of pollen ensures

requ1re.

Seed Crop Care
Typically, cannabis growers use a high-phosphorus, low-nitrogen diet during the flowering
cycle. My personal philosophy is to give seed
production plants a complete balanced diet

Vegetative and flowering plants require tire some fer·
ri/i:zer for good seed development.

throughout the seed gestation period, so all
nutrients required for proper development of
the seeds are available. Because most cannabis·
specific flowering fertilizers are low on nitrogen,
growers may wish to combine vegetative and
flowering fertilizers to ensure a complete diet
tor their seed mothers. Flowering nutrient formulas often lack certain nutrients, and the gestation period is not the time to be starving
plants of these needs. Provide a complete diet,
and let the developing seeds have all they need.
I've found that complete, balanced, organic·
based soil mixes produce the most healthy,
viable seeds. Organic soils contain various bac·
terial populations that break down and digest
soil amendments to make them usable by
plants. 'Sterile' salt-fertilizer based soils do not
support these bacterial populations, and while
they do support plant growth, they lack the
"alive" quality of an organic soil. Many growers
agree that organically grown pot has more fla·
vor and taste than pot grown on a synthetic salt
diet. It could well be that these organic bacterial populations provide some benefit to piant
health, and thus produce more mature, healthy,
viable seeds.
In order to have a discussion on breeding,
there are some terms we must learn in order to
fully understand the concepts. There are more
terms defined in the Glossary.
Genetic material is inherited as described
above, in the seed making section, from both
the pollen donor and mother plant. The genetic
material, or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is
coiled into long, X-shaped strands called chro·
mosomes and stored in the nucleus of every
c;ell. In cannabis, each individual inherits 10 dif·
ferent chromosomes from the staminate pollen
parent, and 10 different chromosomes from the
seed mother or pistillate parent. The resulting
individual has 20 chromosomes total; 2 copies
of each of the 10 chromosomes, or 2 full
genomes. This means there are 2 copies of
every gene in the plant, one from the mother
and one from the father. Each and every cell in
the plant has a copy of this unique DNA compli-

ment. The genetic code is written along the

Phenotypes: Pink (recessive) and
White (dominant)

Dominance
Consider two true-breeding varieties; a white
pistil variety and a variety showing only pink pistils. Both conditions are true-breeding and
therefore homozygous; in each case sexual
reproduction of each group separately leads to
only pink pistil or white pistil plants respectively. An Fl hybrid, or first generation cross of these
two varieties, results in only white pistil plants;
no pink pistils are seen regardless of how many
F1 seeds are grown.
Upon sib mating of these Fl plants (crossing
brothers to sisters, or mating Fl siblings), the
resulting F2 generation produces 75% white
pistil plants and 250/o pink pistil plants. Notice
the "disappearance" of the pink pistil plants in
the Fl generation, and their subsequent "reappearance" in the F2 generation. In this case,
white pistils are said to be dominant over pink
pistils, and pink pistils are said to be recessive to
white pistils.
Again, let's consider the phenotypes seen, and
provide symbols and deduce the genotypes:

Recessive: an intra-allelic interaction such that
an allele of one parent is masked by the presence of an allele from the other parent plant, in
the expression of a ·given trait in the progeny.
The recessive trait is not shown in the first generation of progeny (Fl) but will reappear if siblings are mated, and the F2 progeny will result
in 25% plants showing the recessive condition.
Dominant: an intra-allelic interaction such
that the presence of an allele of one parent
masks the presence of an allele from another
parent plant, in the expression of a given trait in
the progeny. Only the dominant trait is shown in
the first generation of offspring. Of the F2 generation, 75% will also show the dominant condition.

Primary Components of a Breeding
Program
1 - Develop a vision or a breeding goal.

Every breeding program should begin by
developing a breeding goal. Why are you trying
to make seed? What are you trying to accomplish by mating these sets of parents? You might
be trying to make a seed population that represents the traits of an ideal, or mostly ideal plant
you have previously selected. In the case of the
latter, you might be trying to add new traits to
your mostly ideal plant and incorporate these
new traits into a new seedline. Some may just
want some seeds to plant for next year's crop.
Think of your breeding goal as your final destination; the breeding process is the roadmap or
route to get to that goal.
2 - Find or Create Variability.
Finding variable seedlots these days is certainly not a difficult task, because very few breeders
take the time to stabilize or fix certain traits
within a given breeding population prior to
release. Your starting seed stock likely represents a range of variation for most traits,
depending on the source of your initial starting
material. The sad reality is that most of the seed
industry today focuses more on creating seed
for sale than on developing improved or even
uniform plant stock. As a breeder looking for
germ plasm to work with, this leaves unstable
populations with ample variation for future
selection. If searching for variation, this could be
considered a good thing. However, since truebreeding stable plants are what breeders look
for when choosing stock for their own breeding,
this is a hindrance as well. It is much easier to
breed with true breeding plants because one
can see patterns emerging in a predictable
manner in subsequent generations, and thus
expect reliable, consistent results when
hybridizing known true-breeding parents. This
can only be achieved if the breeder is using
true-breeding starting parent stock. Due to the
lack of commercially available true-breeding
stock to work with, serious breeders must stabi-

lize their initial breeding stock before beginning
the hybridizing or out-crossing phases of their
breeding programs.
3 - Crow and evaluate.
Do just as it says. The more plants you grow,
the more variations you will see. I am repeatedly surprised and even amazed to see new
expression of traits when growing this fabulous
species. Cannabis is an extremely variable and
polymorphic species, many traits have numerous possible expressions. Growing varied seed
stocks of different heritage (and many of each
population) ensures the breeder a wide array of
phenotypes and combinations of traits for
future selection.
Choosing from as many plants as possible is
always preferable; having a wide and diverse
starting stock assures the highest chances of
finding what you might be looking for. When
selecting from just a few seeds, it's not possible
to assure all plants will be vigorous or show the
traits of interest even if they are seeds of known
quality. Breeders must weed through large populations of potential plants, and "rogue out" the
undesirable individuals. In any breeding program, off-types which do not suit the goal
should be removed from the breeding populations.
Some recessive traits, especially those controlled by multiple genes (polygenic traits), have
the potential for phenotypes that are only
apparent in 1 in 100 or even 1 in 1000 plants.
Unless growing many individuals, the breeder
has a very low likelihood of discovering these
phenotypes. All other things being equal, the
breeder who grows the most plants has the
greatest possibility of finding the best breeding
candidates. Testing the final product is a crucial
part of the evaluation process, so get out that
bong or those rolling papers and put all your
hard work to the test!
4 - Screen, Select, and Apply Selection
Pressures.
To paraphrase one of the great breeders of the
20th century, select only plants that closely

Rogue out weak females.

match your goal, and reject all others. This is an
important rule to follow if your future generations are to gradually approach your goal.
Breeders select plants for future breeding on
the basis of their desirable characteristics. There
is no "right" or "correct" ranl<ing of priority for
selecting one trait over another; this is purely
based on what traits are most important to the
breeder. For indoor cultivation, these include
short, squat, bushy growth; large, densely
formed buds; discernible taste or particular flavors and aromas; high THC content and quality
of high (long-lasting, soaring, sedative); and
resistance to specific insects or diseases. It's a
good general rule to look for plants with overall
vigor and good health.
Sometimes, we find a plant that is almost ideal
in every respect, but has some negative trait that
is undesirable. For example, the breeder may
select a highly potent plant that produces exceptionally aromatic or flavorful flowers but is tall
and lanky and difficult to grow indoors under
artificial light. Even with this negative trait, the
breeder decides the plant is a worthwhile breeding candidate. The breeder must realize and
note that when selecting plants that may have
some genetic weakness, the unwanted negative
traits must be removed from the population at a
later point. The breeder must balance positive
and negative aspects of each plant as a possible
genetic contributor to future generations.

When planting a large number of seeds, you
will generally find that some plants differ greatly
in regard to certain traits while being otherwise
nearly identical. For example, some plants are
more-or-less susceptible to fungal infection such
as bollytis (grey mold) or powdery mildew.
Once suitable plants are selected, they can be
exposed to a particular pathogen or environment as a selection pressure; growing potential
breeding parents in an environment may expose
genetic strengths or weaknesses associated with
a particular environment. For mold resistant varieties, select plants for future mating that resist
mold in a mold prone environment. For potent
varieties, select only the most potent plants, after
harvest. If you require your plants finish at less
that 6 feet of height, remove 'or only keep seeds
from plants that mature at less than 6 feet. If you
require an outdoor acclimated variety, perform
your selection outdoors under those particular
conditions, and put an emphasis for selection on
plants that mature early enough to finish in your
particular environment. Selecting the earliest of
the most potent plants is a better way to preserve potency, than selecting the most potent of
the early plants. It really depends on what traits
the breeder ranks in importance to the program,
a decision based on the breeding goal.
Usually, varieties that perform well under artifi·
cial lights will also perform well outside or in a
glass house under natural sunlight after two or
three years of acclimation. The converse doesn't
hold true nearly as often. Varieties that perform
well outside, especially pure sativa varieties,
often prove disappointing when grown under
artificial light.
.Post-harvest selection requires either partial
seeding of each plant (only seeds from the most
potent plants are sown for successive genera·
tions) or keeping clone copies of each and
every plant, for future seed production use once
post harvest evaluations are done.

5 - Commercialize.

This is an optional part of a breeding program.
Some people breed to create a variety that suits
their specific growing environment and smoking tastes, without ever intending to profit from
the sale of their work. They just want reliable
seeds for their own planting and future use.
Some are of the opposite extreme; they make
seeds exclusively to sell. These "breeders" do
very little breeding. We refer to them as seed
makers.
Because cannabis is a species under attack
from various governments and other evil forces
around the world, true breeders with goals and
intentions other than financial are sorely needed to protect the genetic resources cannabis has
left. Years of persecution from governments and
greedy seed-making practices without improvement or preservation have led to a genetic bottleneck, a narrowing of the potentially available
breeding stock. Now more than ever, ethical
breeding should be of utmost concern to
cannabis enthusiasts. The species desperately
needs breeders who are willing to improve populations in their possession, all the while preserving valuable genetic resources for future
generations of breeders.
Sam the Skunkman, a great ally of cannabis,
says we all stand on the shoulders of those who
have come before us. We can build upon the
improvements our ancestors have made to landraces and wild populations, but we can only
work with what they have left us. Selections and
advancements come at a cost to genetic variability. Breeders often reduce variability by narrowing the gene pool of that particular population as a consequence of fixing traits. The best
breeders strive to advance and improve a given
variety or population while preserving the variation present for the traits not under selection,
which may prove valuable for future breeders
and growers.

Types of seed populations
Inbred Line/Pure Line
Some refer to these as IBLs. An inbred line is
a seedlot that has been bred for generations
while selecting repeatedly for specific traits, to
the point where the population reliably reproduces the traits under selection in each successive generation of breeding. These plants are
said to breed true for these characteristics. There

MARIJUANA HORTICULtURE The Indoor/ out • • •
is little or no variation for these traits, which are
thus considered pure. Pure lines make t'he best
breeding stock as the progeny of crosses using
known pure parental lines have a predictable
outcome in subsequent generations. Inbred
lines are uniform in growth patterns and traits
and are stable genetically-each generation of
inbred seed results in plants similar in most
ways to the previous generation. Pure lines are
homozygous at most alleles.

Hybrids
Hybrids are a product of a cross between
genetically unlike parents. Hybrids retain their
distinctive characters if reproduced asexually
but fail to reproduce these characters completely or reliably when reproduced sexually. Hybrid
cultivars are developed by using available
inbred lines or creating new ones from segregating populations, and then coupling selection
with inbreeding for homozygosity, evaluation of
inbreds for combining ability in hybrid combinations, and subsequent multiplication of selected
inbred lines for hybrid seed production.

There are various types of hybrid
varieties:
Fl hybrids ('Northern Lights' x 'Blueberry',
'Northern lights' x 'Haze', 'Frostbite')
J-way crosses ('Skunk 4t 1' - a cross of
(Mexican x Columbian) x Afghani)
Double cross hybrids• (a cross of 2 unrelated
Fl hybrids 'Haze' (Afghani x Thai) x (Mexican x
Columbian).

Fl hybrid varieties An Fl hybrid population is obtained by crossing two unrelated, true breeding varieties. Fl
hybrids are unique in that they are uniform
when grown from ~eed, but, like all hybrids, are
genetically unstable. If reproduced sexually by
inbreeding within the FI population, the subsequent generation will be neither uniform nor
similar to the Fl generation.

One of the major benefits of Fl seed to the
grower is a condition known as hybrid vigor, or
heterosis. Hybrid vigor occurs when the proge·
ny resultant from crossing the two parental
inbred lines exceed the performance of the
parental lines in some character, or most often
in sets of characters (Fl < or > Pl or P2).
Fl hybrids are often bigger and more robust
and grow faster than either of the parent populations used in the creation of the Fl population. For example, a ('Skunk~t-1' x 'Blueberry') F1
hybrid may grow faster and yield more than
either the pure 'Skunk 4tl' or 'Blueberry' parent
populations. Often, heterosis is apparent as a
tolerance to adverse environmental conditions.
Fl seed production has benefits to the breeder or seed-maker, as well as the grower. Truebreeding seed can be easily reproduced by
open-pollination. Most seed companies have
no interest in selling easily reproduced seed.
This is as true of corn as it is of cannabis. Very
few companies that do take the time and effort
to breed stable parent stock release it in a pure
form. Most make and release hybrids, as certain
competitor companies' sole mission is to create
knockoff versions of lines released by those
who have actually taken the time to develop
new true-breeding lines. By releasing only
hybrids of their pure lines, seed banks ensure
the customer comes back to buy more of the Fl
seed each time they wish to do a new seed
planting of the variety. They also protect the
investment of their long-term breeding effort by
removing the possibility that a competitor will
reproduce their work and sell it as their own.
Unfortunately, breeders of cannabis drug varieties
have no recourse to the law when others
•
reproduce and market their years of work. Due
to the illegal nature of the plant, drug cannabis
varieties are not protected by the various plant
breeder's rights legislation around the world.
There is, however, at least one drug type
cannabis clone registered for plant protection in
Holland. The clone registered as 'Medsins' is
owned for use by a pharmaceutical company

licensed to grow cannabis for pharmaceutical
production.
Variety • A subdivision of a kind, group, or
family that is distinct in some characters. Within
the variety, all plants exhibit a set of defined
morphological, physiological, or other chemical
characteristics that differentiate the variety from
all other varieties. The variety must be uniform.
Variations in essential and distinctive characters
are described and characterized by the breeder.
The variety will remain unchanged to a reason·
able degree of reliability in its essential and dis·
tinctive characteristics and its uniformity when
reproduced.*
Cultivar (abbreviated cv) - A term derived
from "cultivated variety," a population of cultivated plants clearly distinguished by any number of mOI'phological. physiological, cytological,
or chemical characteristics. When reproduced
sexually or asexually the population retains its
distinguishing characters."'
New selections derived from a cultivar or vari·
ety such that the selection shows sufficient vari·
ation from the parent cultivar to render it wor·
thy of a name, are to be regarded as a distinct
cultivar.

* Note thai the Guidelines for Classifying
Cultivated Plant Populations (1978) stipulate
that variety and cultivar are considered equivalents.
Strain • Strain is not a scientifically accepted
botanical term, although in the cannabis indus·
try many use the term when discussing seedlots
for purchase, for lack of a more accurate term.
Strain is a term incorrectly applied to selections
of cultivars or varieties. In the cannabis seed
industry, very few seedlots could be considered
true varieties or cultivars, because they are not
uniform or do not breed true. All plants within
the population do not reproduce the defining
characteristics, and, usually the variations in the
defining characteristics are not described. Very
often, commercially sold seeds are nothing

I

more than hybrids of hybrids with names, and
there are no defining characteristics of the
"strain." Perhaps "family" or "group" are more
appropriate terms.
Open Pollinated Varieties • Non-hybrid populations reproduced by random pollination
within the variety. All pistillate individuals have
the potential to mate with all staminate individ·
uals as the pollen spreads randomly, ensuring
preservation of the genetic diversity within the
breeding population. In cannabis, open pollination is carried out by planting the breeding population together in a given plot isolated from
other pollen sources and left to the will of the
wind. To maintain varietal purity, hemp breeders
ensure there is no non-varietal pollen source
within four miles upwind, and one mile downwind-which should demonstrate just how far
cannabis pollen can travel on the wind.
Heirloom varieties/Heirloom seeds are the
product of many years of selective planting and
seed saving. The original seeds bore a plant or
flower that had particular traits the grower
liked-typically flavor, color, or psychoactive
effect. The grower then saved the seeds from
the desirable plant and repeated the process
the next season selecting for similar type plants.
The term "heirloom seeds" came about because
the selection process for some cultivars has
been going on for generations, often passed
along within a family and/or shared with
friends.
Heirloom varieties are non-hybrid (open-polli·
nated). This simply means that they breed relatively true. Thus, growers can save seeds from
their crops, plant them the following year, and
expect to see offspring that are very much like
the parent generation. Any off-types in each
generation should be rogued out of the breeding population to keep it pure, as they are likely
the result of pollen contamination from an
external source.
Multi-line • Two or more pure breeding lines,
which are very similar, but differ in a small part
of the overall phenotype (i.e., maturation, dis-

I·.~

ease resistance). The varieties are grown and
bred separately but are subsequently mixed
together and sold in the same seed package.
These packs are a benefit to growers if the
grower's given environment is inconsistent from
year to year, or for growers who are experimenting with growing in a new locations. For example, a multi-line may include a slightly earliermaturing variety with a slightly more moldresistant variety; most other traits are equivalent
in each population. The variations in performance of each variety with regard to mold or earliness of maturity ensure that there will be some
harvest even in a year where only the early varieties finish (as a result of early rains), or even if
mold is more prevalent during the particular
grow season. If a grower is new to an area,
multi-lines may be useful for the first few years
of planting. It is always a shame to plant a single variety, only to find it is not suitable for the
particular climate, thus wasting the year of production. The grower may not reap the highest
yield as may be possible from a single hybrid
variety particularly suited to the climate, but the
degree of variation present in multi-lines helps
to ensure at least some plants are harvested.
Synthetic variety - an interbreeding population derived from inter-mating a group of specific genotypes, each of which were selected for
good combining ability in all possible hybrid
combinations. Subsequent maintenance of the

variety is achieved by open pollination and usually involves rounds of recurrent selection over a
series of generations.
Intersexuality Is a trait that can be expressed
due to a multitude of causes, both genetic and
environmental. There are intersex plants which
are strictly genetic; these plants have inherited a
gene that triggers the intersex condition, even
given a perfect growing environment. They produce both pistillate and staminate flowers on
the same individual under typical environmental conditions. Strict negative selection against
these plants is required by breeders and growers in order to eliminate the intersex trait from
the breeding population. Cultivators and breeders alike have wisely selected against plants that
show the slightest degree of intersexuality. They
know even a single male flower on an otherwise female plant can result in the majority of
the crop being pollinated, and thus seeded.
Indoors, where growers attempt to mimic
Mother Nature, plants often undergo stresses
which are not present under natural conditions.
When plants are stressed by being grown in an
inhospitable environment, the typical expression of characteristics can be altered.
Intersexuality, for example, can also be induced
in cannabis by a grower's influence as a result of
an inconsistent growth environment.
Environmentally stressed female plants have
been known to show the occasional male

flower. Interrupted dark cycles and other types
of stressors can result in the development of
staminate flowers on otherwise pistillate individuals. Environmental conditions which may
provoke sexual reversal include an inconsistent
photoperiod, nutrient toxicities and deficiencies,
pH issues, or drastically fluctuating temperatures during the flowering cycle. Females
severely stressed, for any reason, are more
prone to develop a few male flowers. These
stresses cause changes in the levels of a plant
hormone called ethylene.
Ethylene is one of only a few known plant hormones, and plays many roles in plant development across a range of species. In cannabis, one
of ethylene's major roles is its involvement in
the determination of sex. It regulates which
flowers should be produced- stamen or pistil.

of the plant. The 1Oth pair of chromosomes, the
smallest pair, are the sex chromosomes. Female
cannabis plants have two copies of the X chromosome, therefore their genotype is XX. Male
plants have only 1 copy of the X chromosome,
and a V chromosome instead of a second X
chromosome. The genotype of male plants in
terms of the sex chromosomes is XV.
When pollen is created within the plant, one
of each of the chromosome pairs is packaged
into the cells that develop into pollen. Each
pollen grain or ovule contains 10 chromosomes, 1 copy of each pair. When the pollen
deposits the genetic material into the ovule, the
10 chromosomes from the pollen and the ovule
unite to make a total of 20 chromosomes, a full
genetic compliment.
Let's examine a Punnet square from a typical
male:female cross Male genotype = XY
Female genotype = XX

X y
X XX X'(
Applying a hormonal spray is easy.

We know this because applying high enough
concentrations of ethylene to staminate individuals in the flowering cycle results in the formation of pistils. Conversely, applying ethyleneinhibiting agents to pistillate individuals as they
enter flowering results in the formation of stamens in place of pistils. This practice can be of
use to breeders in the creation of "feminized''
seeds, or all-female (gynoecious) seecllots.
All lema le seeds are produced by obtaining
pollen from one female individual, and subsequently fertilizing another female plant.
When we previously discussed chromosomes,
we said there were 20 chromsomes in each cell

X XX XY
From above we can see that half of the plants
are XV (male) and half of the plants are XX
(female).
Let's now look at a Punnet
square from a
•
female:female cross -

• ••

This Punnet square shows us that
female:female breeding schemes produce only
female (XX) offspring.
Some growers intentionally use the pollen
from intersex plants to fertilize females. They
have found that the seeds and subsequent offspring produced from this union will be predominately female. The major problem with this
technique is that these plants will have intersex
tendencies. By selecting parent plants that have
intersex tendencies, we ensure that some of the
progeny will also have intersex tendencies.
Using pollen from an intersex or hermaphrodite
plant is an intentional selection for intersexuality- like begets like.
Some seed companies market "feminized
seeds," which are produced by collecting pollen
from carefully selected, latent, stress-induced
hermaphrodites, and use it to pollinate female
plants. This process is time consuming and
arduous, but yields mostly female plants when
grown without stress. However, under the
stresses that resulted in the intersexuality for the
pollen parent, the progeny will often show
some degree of intersexuality as well. Again, like
begets like.
So how do we get true females (that do not
show any degree of intersexuality under normal
conditions) to produce pollen? Can we get
pollen from female plants that do not show a
degree of intersexuality?
There are hormone treatments, which, when
applied to cannabis, result in the formation of
staminate flowers on otherwise pistillate plants.
To select against the intersex condition, we take
our chosen female breeding candidates and
grow them under stressful conditions that may
lead to the 'formation of male flowers- irregular
light cycle, high heat, etc. Only plants that resist
intersexuality under these conditions should be
considered as potential breeding parents for the
creation of all-female seed lines. We call these
intersex-resistant plants "true females."
Intentional selection against intersex plants is
the only way to ensure intersex-free offspring.

Clone copies of these pistillate intersex-resistant plants are then sprayed with our hormone
treatment and placed into the flowering cycle
and allowed to develop stamens. It typically
takes three to five weeks for the plants to enter
dehiscence and shed pollen. True female candidates that also resist intersexuality under typical
stresses, are pollinated by pollen obtained by
our hormone-treated, gender-reversed, stamenbearing female plants. The result is a true
gynoecious population, consisting entirely of
female plants.
An American company, Hybritech, was the first
to introduce an effective ready-to-use hormone
treatment-eliteXelite. This product is no longer
available for public purchase. Another plant
research firm, PG-Solutions, has since developed and released a ready-to-use hormone
therapy spray, Stamen-It!. Stamen-It! is extremely effective in causing gender reversal of pistillate individuals. Some hormone sprays are able
to induce staminate flower formation, but fail to
produce viable pollen in any significant quantities. PG-Solutions has developed a formulation
that causes significant pollen production, even
in the most reversal-resistant genotypes. If you
are interested in this technology, check their
website, www.PGSolutions.com.

Breeding schemes for crosspollinated crops
There are many types of breeding programs,
some more complex than others. Which breeding method to employ depends entirely on the
breeder's goal. Ideally, potential breeders understand the benefits and drawbacks of each strat·egy, so a suitable strategy can be chosen to
achieve the desired goal. The breeder's personal preference always comes into play when
choosing a breeding program. Previous successes may influence a breeder to use one specific
breeding strategy over another. Some breeders
rely heavily on science and statistics when analyzing the performanee of their hybrids or progeny. Others consider breeding more of an art,

and select based on feeling. Over the course of
a breeding program, a breeder will often use
more than one method to achieve vari ous
aspects of the goal.
When breeding cross-pollinators, we discuss
hybrid performance in terms of combining ability-the ability of an inbred line to give characteristic performance in hybrid combinations with
other lines. The progenies are tested lor performance as populations and related back to
the parental generation. Some often-used
measures of performance are general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability
(SCA). General combining ability is the average
or overall performance of a given line in hybrid
combinations open-pollinated with other lines.
Specific combining ability is the performance
of a specific line, as compared to other lines,
when crossed with the same specific pollen
source.
Open pollination is a very low effort type of
seed production and involves minimal, if any,
selection. Seeds are planted, grown to maturity,
and allowed to interbreed. Off-types, or plants
that do not represent the defining characteristics of the variety, are rogued from the breeding
population, to ensure the variety remains pure
and true to type. Inbred lines, and other populations maintained through open pollination,
are often bred by one person, and then produced for commercial production and release
by others. Some breeders create true-breeding
populations, then licence them to other companies who plant them and expand the seed populations by growing out many, many plants and
allowing them all to fully seed. This is called a
seed-increase.

Inbreeding
Inbreeding is nothing more than crossing a
group, family, or variety of plants within themselves with no additions of genetic material
from an outside or unrelated population. The
most severe form of inbreeding is the self-cross,
in which only one individual's genetic material
form s the basis of subsequent generations. 1: 1

Inbreeding consists of crossing a group, family, or
variety of plants with themselves.

hybrid populations are only slightly less narrow,
derived from the genetic material of 2 individuals. Such tight or narrow breeding populations
lead to a condition called "inbreeding depression" upon repeated sell-breeding or inbreed.1ng.
Inbreeding depression is a reduction in vigor
(or any other character) due to prolonged
inbreeding. This can manifest as a reduction in
potency or a decrease in yield or rate of growth.
Progress of depression is dependent, in part, on
the breeding system of the crop. Earlier, when
we discussed dioecy, we said cannabis is an
out-crossing or cross-pollinating species. Crosspollinated crops usually exhibit a higher degree
of inbreeding depression when "selfed," or
inbred, than do selling crops. For example,
tomato (an inbreeding or selling species) can
be selled for 20 generations with no apparent
loss in vigor or yield, whereas some experiments have shown that the yield of corn per

•••

acre is decreased quite dramatically when
inbred for 20 generations.
In cross-pollinated crops, deleterious genes
remain hidden within populations, and the negative attributes of these recessive traits can be
revealed or unmasked via continual inbreeding.
Inbreeding depression can be apparent in S1
populations after a single generation of self-fertilization. When breeding cannabis using small
populations, as is often the case with continual
1:I mating schemes, inbreeding depression typically becomes apparent within three to six generations. To deal with this problem, breeders
often maintain separate parallel breeding lines,
each of which are selected for similar or identical sets of traits. After generations of inbreeding,
when each of the inbred lines, or selfed populations, begin to show inbreeding depression,
they are hybridized or out-crossed to each other
to restore vigor and eliminate inbreeding
depression while preserving the genetic stability
of the traits under selection.

and health of cannabis germ plasm. Sadly, this is
the preferred breeding scheme used today by
the majority of commercial seed banks. These
breeders don't realize that cannabis is naturally
an out-crossing or cross-pollinating species and
existed in wild breeding populations of hundreds if not thousands of individuals. Within
these many individuals lies a wide range of versions of different genes. When we select only
one or two plants from this vast array as our
breeding population, we drastically reduce the
genetic variability found in the original population (a genetic bottleneck). This variability is lost
from the populations, and unavailable to future
generations.
Outbreeding - the process of crossing or
hybridizing plants or groups of plants with other
plants to which there is no, or only a distant,
relation. Any time a breeder is hybridizing using
plants that reside outside of the family, group, or
variety, hybrid seed is produced. For example,
an Fl hybrid seed is the first generation offspring resulting from a cross of two distinct true-

breeding plants or populations. Each of the parent populations were hybridized (out-crossed to
each other) to produce the new generation,
which is now comprised of genetics from both
parental populations. Out-crossing results in the
introduction of new and different genetic material to each of the respective pools.
Filial Breeding - A type of breeding system
where siblings of the same progeny lot and generation are inter-mated to produce new generations. The first hybrid generation of two distinct

cannabis.
The backcross method is a suitable scheme for
Backcross Breeding - A type of breeding that
involves repeated crossing of progeny with one adding new desirable traits to a mostly ideal,
of the original parental genotypes; cannabis relatively true-breeding genotype. When
breeders most often cross progeny to the moth- embarking on a backcross breeding plan, the
er plant. This parent is known as the recurrent recurrent parent should be a highly acceptable
parent. The non-recurrent parent is called the or nearly ideal genotype (for example, an existdonor parent. More widely, any time a genera- ing commercial cultivar or inbred line). The ideal

form of backcross breeding. Backcross breeding seed line should be simply inherited and easily

Backcross breeding is best ~sed when adding
ing is to create a population of individuals
derived mainly from the genetics of one single simply inherited dominant traits that can easily
be identified in the progeny of each generation
parent (the recurrent parent).
The donor parent is chosen based on a trait of (Example 1). Recessive traits are more difficult
to select for in backcross breeding, since their

expression is masked by dominance in each
backcross to the recurrent parent. An additional
round of open pollination or sib-mating is needed after each backcross generation, to expose
homozygous-recessive plants. Individuals showing the recessive condition are selected from F2
segregating generations and backcrossed to the
recurrent parent (see Example 2).

Example 1~ Backcrossing:
Incorporating a dominant trait
Stepl -Recurrent Parent x Donor Parent

I

v
F1 Hybrid generation

Step 2 - Select desirable plants showing dominant trait, and hybridize selected plants to
recurrent parent. The generation produced is
denoted BC1 (some cannabis breeders break
from botanical convention and denote this generation Bx1. [BC1= Bx1]).
Step 3 - Select plants from BC1 and hybridize
with the recurrent parent; the resulting generation is denoted BC2.
Step 4 - Select plants from BC2 and hybridize
with the recurrent parent; the resulting generation is denoted BC3.

Example 2 Backcrossing:
Incorporating a recessive trait
Stepl - Recurrent Parent x Donor

I

v

F1 Hybrid generation

Step 2 - Select desirable pia nts, and create an
F2 population via full sib-mating.
Step 3 - Select plants showing the desired
recessive trait in the F2 generation, then
hybridize selected F2-recessive plants to the
recurrent parent. The generation produced is
denoted BCl.

Step 4 - Select plants from BC 1, and create a
generation of F2 plants via sib-mating; the
resulting generation can be denoted BC1 F2.
Step 5 - Select desirable BC1F2 plants showing the recessive condition, and hybridize with
the recurrent par~nt; the resulting generation is
denoted BC2.
Step 6 - Select plants from BC2, and create an
F2 population via sib-mating; denote the resulting generation BC2 F2.
Step 7 - Select plants showing the recessive
condition from the BC2F2 generation, and
hybridize to the recurrent parent; the resulting
generation is denoted BC3.
Step a - Grow out BC3, select and sib-mate
the most ideal candidates to create an F2 population, where plants showing the recessive
condition are then selected and used as a basis
for a new inbred, or open-pollinated, seed line.
This new generation created from the F2 is a
population that consists of, on average, -93.7%
of genes from the recurrent parent, and only
-6.3% of genes leftover from the donor parent.
Most importantly, one should note that since
only homozygous-recessives were chosen for
mating in the BC3F2 generation, the entire
resulting BC3F3 generation is homozygous for
the recessive trait, and breeds true for this recessive trait. Our new population meets our breeding objective. It is a population derived mainly
from the genetics of the recurrent parent, yet
breeds true for our introgressed recessive trait.
Backcross derived lines are expected to be
well-adapted to the environment in which they
will be grown, which is another reason backcrossing is often used by cannabis breeders
who operate indoors. Indoor grow rooms are
easily replicated all over the world, so the grower is able to grow the plants in a similar environment in which they were bred. Progeny therefore need less extensive field-testing by the
breeder across a wide range of environments.
If two or more characters are to be introgressed into a new seed line, these would usually be tracked in separate backcross programs,

and the individual products would be combined
in a final set of crosses after the new populations have been created by backcrossing. •
The backcross scheme has specific drawbacks,
however. When the recurrent parent is not very
true-breeding, the resulting backcross generations segregate, and many of the traits deemed
desirable to the line fail to be reproduced reliably. Another limitation of the backcross is that
the "improved" variety differs only slightly from
the recurrent parent (e.g., one trait). If multiple
traits are to be introgressed into the new population, other techniques such as inbreeding or
recurrent selection, may be more rewarding.

Selfing
Selling is the process of creating seed by fertilizing a plant with pollen obtained from itself.
The result of a self-cross is a population of
plants that derive from a single individual. The
first generation population derived from selfing
an individual is called the SI population. If an
individual is chosen from the S1, and again selfed, the resulting population is denoted the 52
generation. Subsequent generations derived in
the same manner are denoted 53, 54, etc.
Traits for which the plant is homozygous
remain homozygous upon selling, whereas heterozygous loci segregate, and may demonstrate
novel expressions 'of these characters.
We know homozygous loci remain homozygous in future generations upon selling, but
what about the heterozygous loci? Each selfed
generation leads to an increase in homozygosity by 50% for each heterozygous locus, and
each subsequent generation, derived from selling an S1 individual, is 500/o more homozygous
than the parent from which it was derived.
Repeated selling, or single seed descent, is the
fastest way to achieve homozygosity within a
group or family. Again, the more plants grown
from a selfed population, the better probability
a breeder has of finding selfed progeny that
show all of the desired traits.

Single-seed descent - A plant is self-fertilized

and the resulting seed collected. One of these
seeds is selected and grown, again self-fertilized, and seed produced. All progeny and future
generations have descended from a single
ancestor, as long as no pollen from an external
family is introduced. Each generation is the
result of selling one individual from the previous
generation.
After six generations of selfing without selection, 98.44% of the genes of an individual are
homozygous-this refers to genes, not the number of plants that are homozygous.
Recurrent Selection - Any breeding program
designed to concentrate favorable genes scattered among a number of individuals by repeated cycles of selection for favorable traits.
Step 1- Identify superior genotypes for the trait
under selection.
Step 2 - Inter-mate the superior genotypes
and select improved progeny.
Step 3 - Repeat steps 1 & 2 over a series of
generations.
Pedigree Selection - A system of breeding in
which individual plants are selected in the segregating generations from a cross on the basis
of their desirability, judged individually, and on
the basis of a pedigree record.
PLOIDY - Cannabis plants are, by nature,
diploids with twenty chromosomes. At meiosis,
each parent's gamete contributes ten chromosomes to the zygote they have formed.
Cannabis cells may be haploid (have 1 copy of
each chromosome set) as in gametes, or diploid
(2 chromosome sets per cell).
Some researchers have wondered whether
triploid, or tetraploid cannabis (cells with either
3 or 4 chromosome sets respectively) are agronomically important. In some species, polyploid
plants grow bigger, yield more, or outperform
typical diploid members of the same species.
Some early reports touted polyploid cannabis as
being more more potent. This research was
flimsy and unscientific at best, and ever since
this report, many cannabis growers have

'

attempted inducing polyploidy in many varieties, none leading to agronomic success.
Diploid plants are considered normal and
have one set of chromosomes, which occur in
pairs within each plant cell. Polyploid plants
have more than one set of chromosomes per
cell. Polyploid plant chromosomes occur in
groups of 3-4 instead of in pairs. Tetraploid
plants groups occur with four chromosomes in
each cell.
At one time, breeders believed that polyploid
and tetraploid plants would produce a superior
resin-packed plant.
The polyploid characteristic can be induced
with an application of colchicine. Just remember, colchicine is a poison, and polyploid plants
do not contain more THC-potent resin.

Mutagenesis-Inducing Variation
If variation does not exist for the trait or traits
of interest, or cannot be found in other populations, it is theoretically possible to induce variation by exposing seeds or other tissues to radiation, alkylating agents, or other mutagens such
as colchicine or EMS (ethylmethylsulfonate).
These treatments cause changes at the DNA
level that have the remote potential to result in
desirable, novel phenotypes.
.
There is much rumour and speculation about
this technique amongst breeders and growers.
It's a common myth that treating seeds with
colchicine and growing the plants results in
more potent cannabis plants. Let's put this myth
to rest; it is completely untrue. While the possibility does exist on a theoretical level, no valid
experiments have ever shown this to be true.
Potential breeders would be better off using
their time and space for selecting better plants
than trying this technique as a me~hod for
improving plant stock.
That being said, 'let's take a look at the theory
behind the concept.
Imagine you have a population of plants
which, when grown from seed and inbred within the population, consistently produces high-

..

THC plants. It is theoretically possible to treat
many of these seeds with a mutagen, grow and
inbreed the seeds, and find plants in subsequent generations that produce no THC. These
mutagens can destroy genes along a chromosome, and when copies of this chromosome are
inherited by future generations, a new or
"novel" phenotype can appear. In our example,
the no THC condition is the novel phenotype.
These mutations, however, occur at random
and are extremely unreliable. The probability of
finding plants which have a desired mutation in
the gene of interest is very low. A breeder may
treat many thousands of seeds, grow 100,000
plants, and still not see the desired altered phenotypes. This technique is costly in both time
and space. It is often used in the breeding of
"legal plants" when growing out thousands of
individuals and searching for these novel phenotypes is not problematic. Performing such
population screens in cannabis is not practical,
especially for clandestine breeders. The potentially hazardous nature of these mutagenic
agents is another very good reason to choose
other breeding options. Inducing variability is
likely not the best option, at least for the hobby
breeder.

For example, if you want 1500 ppm and ambient C0 2 is 350 ppm, you will need to add: 1500
ppm minus 350 ppm = 1150 ppm C02•
A poorly sealed grow room can have 20 percent leakage which should be added to the

Jorge Cervantes, with his books and countless articles, continues to
help cannabis growers today just as they have for more than 20
years. Jorge has traveled throughout much of the world to research
cannabis growing so that he can share this information with you.
Medical gardens are of much interest to Cervantes.
Jorge writes a monthly column, Jorge's Rx, and regular feature articles in 1-figh Times magazine. He also writes a regular column in all
editions (Dutch, English, French, Italian and Spanish) of Soft Secrets
magazines. His work has also appeared in numerous magazines
