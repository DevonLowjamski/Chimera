1. Introduction  
ABSTRACT  
Given the special pharmacological value of cannabidiol (CBD), industrial hemp (hemp) has become a real “hot”  crop. Though indoor farming of hemp has been widely used, the effects of red and blue light-emitting diode  (LED) acting as supplementary light on the CBD synthesis in hemp remains unclear. Herein, a pot experiment  with six treatments [CK, high-pressure sodium as light source, (R:B (ratio of red light to blue light) 9.30:1, PPFD  (photosynthetic photon flux density) 191); LED1 (R:B 9.20:1; PPFD 129); LED2 (R:B 1.61:1; PPFD 540); LED3 (R:  B 6.47:1; PPFD 28.2); LED4 (R:B 7.15:1; PPFD 41.7); LED5 (R:B 16.8:1; PPFD 252)] was carried out to study the  effects of LED light quality on the growth and cannabinoid synthesis of hemp. Results showed that LED2 and  LED5 could well maintain hemp growth compared with CK in terms of plant height, stem diameter, and leaf  numbers. Compared with CK, the treatment of LED1, LED4, and LED3 significantly decreased the aboveground  biomass, while LED2 and LED5 notably improved the aboveground biomass with an increment of 15.2 % and  55.1 %; the biomass of hemp flowers for LED2 and LED5 was markedly increased compared with that for CK with  increments of 238 % and 61.5 %, respectively, but the other LED light treatments significantly reduced the  flowers yield; LED2 could significantly increase the CBD content of both leaves (1.81 %) and flowers (5.83 %)  compared to CK (leaves 1.38 %, flowers 4.27 %) while LED5 only notably increased the CBD content of leaves;  among the LED treatments, the theoretic CBD yield for a per plant of LED2 and LED5 was 26.8 % and 9.0 %  higher than that of CK. In conclusion, different red and blue LED light intensity ratios would dramatically in fluence the growth and cannabinoid synthesis of hemp, LED2 and LED5 can be good choices for indoor farming  of hemp targeted for higher CBD yield.

Industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L., hemp) is defined as a kind of  cannabis with Δ-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) less than 0.3 % and not  usable as a drug. As a traditional versatile crop, it has been cultivated for  over 10,000 years and applied to many fields, such as textile, paper, oil,  food, medicine, and even the biocomposite, automotive, and aviation  sectors (Abot et al., 2013; Guerriero et al., 2019; House et al., 2010;  Huang et al., 2019; Zegada-Lizarazu et al., 2010). In recent years, hemp  has become a real “hot” crop due to its special pharmacological values,  especially for cannabidiol (CBD). Nowadays, CBD has attracted much  more attention than ever before (Corroon and Kight, 2018), which is not  addictive but effective in curing many difficult diseases, such as epi lepsy, Alzheimer, anxiety, pain, and inflammation (Blessing et al., 2015;

medical uses, CBD has also been applied to foods, drinks, cosmetics, and  health products, which shows great profits in the markets. The above  reasons have contributed to the increase of the planting area as well as  the indoor farming for hemp. Indoor farming shows easy-management  for light, nutrients, temperature, water and it can be modified and  adjusted to improve crop yields. Besides, it does not compete for land  with the main crop and uses space with high efficiency. Thus, indoor  farming seems a good choice to obtain the target high-value products of  hemp, such as CBD. However, only under suitable conditions can indoor  farming obtain ideal yields, such as suitable light conditions.  
It is well known that light plays an indispensable role in the higher  plant because it is one of the necessary conditions for photosynthesis.

Only obtains enough light, can plant grow and finish their life cycle.  While, light can not only provide energy for photosynthesis, but also can  act as sensory signals in modulating growth and development, altering  physiological functions, and regulating biochemical pathways (Klem  et al., 2019). Light conditions, such as light quality, light density, and  photoperiod, can significantly affect plant growth and development,  while light quality is the most complex one. The responses of the plant to  different light conditions depend on the various photoreceptor, such as  the phytochromes (perceiving red/far-red light), cryptochromes  (perceiving blue light), and UVR8 (perceiving UV-light) (Lin, 2002; Ma  and Dai, 2019). These photoreceptors can perceive the light quality or  spectral composition and act as signaling cues to regulate the gene  expression, and finally lead to the changes in morphology and devel opment of plant (Kami et al., 2010).  
The photosynthetic active spectrum for plants mainly concentrates in  the visible part, especially in red (600–700 nm) and blue (400–500 nm)  light (Spalholz et al., 2020). The spectrum can affect photosynthesis  through plants of leaf structure, leaf size, leaf senescence rate, photo 
synthate transport, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, and  composition directly and indirectly. Especially, the blue light can affect  plant height, stomatal opening, circadian clock, photosynthate trans port, photomorphogenesis, flowering time, and chlorophyll biosynthesis  (Urbonaviˇciut ¯ e ˙ et al., 2007; Heo et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2010). Compared  with the blue light, red light has less confirmed and recognized effect,  Barreiro et al. (1992) found that a low R/FR ratio led to the decreased  photosynthetic capacity of kidney beans, which may be caused by the  decrease of leaf area. However, Li and Kubota (2009) found that the  promoting effect of FR supplementation on growth may be due to the  increase of light absorption caused by the increase of leaf area (Li and  Kubota, 2009).  
As one of the most important factors influencing yields, the effects of  light on crop yield in indoor farming have been investigated for a long  time. Before the light-emitting diode (LED) appears, high-pressure

sodium, incandescent lamps, fluorescent lamps, and metal halide lamps  were widely used for indoor farming. Compared to these lamps, LED  lamps feature flexible mobility, narrow spectrum range, low energy  consumption, and longevity (Bourget, 2008; Gupta and Agarwal, 2017),  besides, and these have made LED lamps more popular in indoor  farming (De Keyser et al., 2019; Nakai et al., 2020; Poulet et al., 2014;  Zabel et al., 2016). The above attributes also make it possible to mediate  the spectrum for the specific crop by controlling each spectral range and  manipulating spectral quality and light intensity precisely (Gupta and  Agarwal, 2017; Pan, 2008). However, the best spectral ranges of LED  lights and the ratios of different monochromatic LED lights usually vary  among different crops for higher production. Studies showed that  compared with the monochrome of red or blue light, the combination of  red and blue light can more efficiently excite photoreceptors and in crease both photosynthesis and plant growth (Sabzalian et al., 2014;  Spalholz et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Li et al. (2018) found that LED  lights can effectively promote peanut (Arachis hypogaea Linn.) growth  and the ratio of red: blue 3:7 was best for pod growth and yield. But  Poulet et al. (2014) proved red: blue 19:1 would give the best growth  response for lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and He et al. (2017) demonstrated  that the combination of red: blue 9:1 can obtain the highest shoot and  root biomass and shoot/root ratio of Mesembryanthemum crystallinum.  Thus, the ratios of red light to blue LED light should be considered for  indoor farming.  
In recent years, industrial hemp has attracted more attention than  ever before, and the UN’decision of removing cannabis from the nar cotics list in January 2021 would further promote the global hemp in dustry. As one of the most valuable products, CBD will be a “hot cake”  for a long time. Thus, both farmers and researchers are interested in  improving the CBD yield by trying different methods. Without a doubt,  indoor farming combined with LED as a light source can be good access.  Although some studies have investigated the effects of light quality on  hemp, the studies mainly focused on the impacts of photoperiod, light

intensity, and monochromatic light on the THC content in hemp using  non-LED light sources (Blessing et al., 2015; Chandra et al., 2008; Lydon  et al., 1987; Valle et al., 1978). Previous studies have proved that light  quality could affect the THC synthesis and accumulation in hemp.  However, up to now, few studies have investigated the influence of  different red and blue LED light ratios on the growth and CBD synthesis  of hemp. Therefore, a hypothesis was raised that different red and blue  LED light ratios can significantly impact the growth and CBD yield of  hemp. Through this study, it was expected to obtain one or two suitable  red and blue LED ratios for high CBD-yield hemp growing in indoor  farming.  
2. Materials and methods  
2.1. Experimental design and procedures  
The hemp seeds (“Xinma”) used in this study were provided by the  Institute of Bast Fiber Crops, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.  The experimental procedures were as follows: firstly, the hemp seeds  were grown in seedling dishes containing nutritional soil (peat soil:  perlite: vermiculite = 1:1:1) in a culture room (16 h light/8 h dark at 24  ± 1 ◦C and RH 60 %) and irrigated with distilled water every two days.  Secondly, at the two-leaf stage, the seedlings were transplanted into  plastic pots (30 cm × 20 cm) and placed in plant growing tents (1.2 m × 
1.5 m) equipped with LED lamps for 110 days under the condition of 16/  8 h (day/night) at 24℃, during this period, the male plant was removed  for each treatment when it emerged.  
Six treatments were set in the experiment: CK, using high-pressure  sodium as light source, (R:B (ratio of red light to blue light) 9.30:1,  PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density) 191); LED1 (R:B 9.20:1;  
PPFD 129); LED2 (R:B 1.61:1; PPFD 540); LED3 (R:B 6.47:1; PPFD 28.2);  LED4 (R:B 7.15:1; PPFD 41.7); LED5 (R:B 16.8:1; PPFD 252). Three pots  were placed in each tent and there was one plant in each pot. Each  treatment was replicated three times. The high-pressure sodium (220 V,  50 W) was brought from the Heming Co., Shanghai, China. The LED  lamps (single LED band size, 2.8 mm × 3.5 mm) were supplied by the  Weizaoye Co., in Guangzhou, China: LDE1 (45 W), LED2 (120 W), LED3  (200 W), LED4 (240 W), LED5 (300 W). And the parameters of the light  measured using the Spectrograph OHSP-350 s (HopooColor Technology  Co., Hangzhou, China) were shown in Fig. 1.  
2.2. Measurements and methods  
The growth parameters, such as plant height, stem diameter of hemp  were measured. In details: plant height was measured with a straight  steel ruler (from the base of the stem to the apex of the plant); stem  diameter was measured with a vernier caliper; the number of leaves was  directly counted at the end of the experiment; the leaf area was  measured using the leaf area meter Yaxin-1241 (Yaxin Liyi Technology  Co., Beijing, China). After that, the plants were harvested (16 weeks)  and dried, and the dry weight of the stem and leaves, roots, and flowers  were recorded.  
Biomass samples taken from apical segments (flowering buds) of  hemp were used for cannabinoids analysis following the procedure in  the literature (Ambach et al., 2014; Hadener et al., 2019; Raharjo and  Verpoorte, 2004). Briefly, the inflorescence samples of hemp were firstly  separated into leaves and flowers, then were dried at 70 ◦C in an oven,  respectively, and next were ground into power (≦0.425 mm). After that,  the sample was extracted with a mixture of methanol/hexane 9:1 (v:v)  by ultrasonication for 20 min (flowers:extractant (w:v) 5:1; leaves:

3. Results  
3.1. Morphological characteristics  
Different light qualities can lead to visible morphological differences  of hemp plants (Figs. 2 and 3). The plant height of hemp for LED5 (R:B  16.8:1; PPFD 252) (145.60 cm) and LED2 (R:B 1.61:1; PPFD 540)  (140.20 cm) showed no significant difference compared with that for CK  (142.03 cm), while LED3 (R:B 6.47:1; PPFD 28.2), LED4 (R:B 7.15:1;  PPFD 41.7), notably decreased the plant height. The LED3 and LED4  notably decreased the hemp stem diameter by more than 50 %  compared with that for CK, but other LED light treatments showed no  marked difference relative to CK. As for the leaf area, it was significantly  decreased by all LED light treatments compared with CK, while among  the LED light treatments, LED5 and LED3 obtained the largest and

smallest leaf area, respectively. The effects of light quality on the  number of hemp leaves were similar to that on the plant height.  
3.2. Biomass  
The distribution of dry biomass to the stem (with leaves), roots and  flowers were significantly affected by LED light treatments (Table 1).  Compared with CK, the biomass of stem was notably increased by LED2  and LED5, with increments of 15.2 % and 55.1 %, respectively, while the  other LED light treatments significantly decreased the stem biomass.  Compared with CK, LED2 and LED5 significantly increased the root

biomass by 273 % and 152 %, respectively, but LED1 (R: B 9.20:1; PPFD  129), LED4, and LED3 only obtained no more than 0.03 g biomass per  plant. Similar to the root part, the biomass of flowers was also notably  increased by LED2 and LED5 (with an increment of 238 % and 61.5 %,  respectively) relative to CK.  
3.3. Cannabinoids content and CBD yield  
The LED light treatments markedly affected the cannabinoids con tent and yield of the hemp plant (Figs. 4 and 5). The CBD content for  LED5 (1.89 w/w) and LED2 (5.83 w/w) were the highest among all the  treatments with increments of 36.9 % and 36.5 % for leaves and flowers  respectively, compared with that for CK (1.37 w/w, 4.27 w/w). There  was also a notable increment of CBD in leaves for LED2 (1.81 w/w)  relative to CK (1.37 w/w), but no comparable difference between the  two treatments was found for the CBD content in flowers. Among other  treatments, LED4 (0.89 w/w) markedly decreased the CBD content in  leaves compared with CK, while LED3 (3.97 w/w) significantly reduced  that in flowers. Whether the CBD content in hemp was increased or not,  the THC contents in both organs for all treatments were still under the  standard of 0.3 %.

LED5 (R:B 16.8:1; PPFD 252). Different letters  
above the columns represent significant differ 
ences (P < 0.05).  
Based on the dry biomass of flowers and CBD content, the theoretical  CBD yield per plant of each treatment was calculated (Fig. 5). The CBD  yield for six treatments differed from each other significantly. The  highest CBD yield was found in LED2 (0.14 mg), followed by LED5 (0.12  mg), and the lowest CBD yield was found in LED3 (0.003 mg). The CBD  yields of LED2 and LED5 were 26.8 % and 9.0 % higher than that of CK,  respectively.  
3.4. Correlations between different parameters  
Pearson correlations between parameters obtained from both light  and hemp were calculated (Fig. 6). Results showed that red light had a  negative correlation with the CBD synthesis and accumulation, but blue  light showed a positive correlation with that. The ratio of Red: Blue  showed a notably negative correlation with THC in the leaf. While the  ratio of Blue: Red showed a notably positive correlation with PPFD,  flower biomass, as well as CBD in flower. PPFD was notably and posi 
tively correlated with flower biomass, CBD in flower, and THC in flower.  The CBD yield per plant was significantly and positively related with  PPFD, flower biomass, CBD/THC in flower. As the target product, the  CBD yield was almost positively correlated with all the measured pa 
rameters except the red light and showed a significantly positive cor relation with PPFD, flower biomass, total biomass, CBD in flower, and  THC in flower.  
4. Discussion  
4.1. Effects of LED light qualities/wavelengths on hemp growth  
Light is a necessary factor determining crop yield, the suitable  spectral ranges and combinations can contribute to obtaining higher  target products (Bian et al., 2018; Brown et al., 1995; Choi et al., 2015).  Red and blue LED light ratios in the lighting spectrum were proved to be  efficient enough for the normal growth and photosynthesis of various  crops (Bian et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2015). In the present study,  different red and blue LED light ratios showed distinct effects on hemp  growth (Fig. 2), the hemp plant height, stem diameter, leaf area, and the  number of leaves can be either slightly increased or significantly  decreased by the supplied LED light compared with high-pressure so dium (CK). This result indicated that suitable red and blue LED light  ratios can promote the growth of hemp.  
For red light, its increasing proportion to total light hardly showed  positive effects on hemp growth (Fig. 6). While the increment of the

proportion of blue light to total light negatively correlated with the plant  height, stem diameter, and so on, it can be positively correlated with the  hemp flower biomass in hemp. Thus, the results of this study indicated  that the higher proportion of blue light would increase the photosyn 
thate accumulation in inflorescence and consequently restrain the  vegetative growth of hemp. This was an important finding, especially for  medical hemp cultivation, since most of the medicinal components were  produced in the inflorescence of hemp (Fiorini et al., 2019). Especially,  for the present study, both LED2 (R: B 1.61:1; PPFD 540) and LED5 (R: B  16.8:1; PPFD 252) can significantly increase the biomass of flowers,  which suggested the LED2 and LED5 might be useful in promoting the  CBD yield in hemp flowers. Similar results between light treatments  were found in some species that focused on the effects of varying light  intensities on the photosynthetic response (Bazzaz and Carlson, 1982;  Hallik et al., 2012; Wahidin et al., 2013). On the other hand, interest ingly, the combination of red and blue light can make up the disad 
vantages from either light, since the ratios of these two lights can  significantly promote the growth of hemp (Table 1 and Fig. 3). As a  result, it can be hypothesized some combinations of red light and blue  LED light can contribute to the growth of hemp while increasing the  target product yield.  
4.2. Effects LED light qualities/wavelengths on the cannabinoid content  
The increment in the proportion of red light to total light showed  negative correlations with both CBD and THC content in hemp (Fig. 6),  
but the increasing proportion of blue light to total light showed contrary  correlations. These findings indicated that the higher proportion of blue  light would promote the synthesis and accumulation of cannabinoids in  hemp. However, the combination of red and blue light could change the  situation and different ratios of two lights can lead to varied effects on  the cannabinoid distribution and accumulation (Figs. 4–5). CBD yield in  hemp is not only determined by the relative content of CBD in plant  organs but also depends on the biomass of the source organs. In this  study, LED2 (R: B 1.61:1; PPFD 540) and LED5 (R: B 16.8:1; PPFD 252)  can significantly increase the biomass of flowers, this also contributed to  the CBD yield greatly.  
The content of THC in hemp is also a focus for scientists since many  countries are forbidden planting hemp with THC > 0.3 %, such as China.  In this study, the LED light treatment can significantly improve or  decrease the content of THC in the hemp organs, but the content of THC  for all the harvested samples is below the permissible level. Thus the  present study suggested that it is possible to increase CBD yield by  combining indoor-farming and LED light in hemp.  
4.3. The roles of LED light as signaling cues  
Light can not only provide energy for photosynthesis, but also can act  as sensory signals in modulating growth and development, altering  physiological functions, and regulating biochemical pathways (Klem  et al., 2019). For the present study, the increment of blue light propor 
tion showed a positive correlation with flower biomass and CBD content  
6 
Industrial Crops & Products 165 (2021) 113433 
X. Wei et al. 
in flower, these responses were mediated by the blue light receptors i.e.  cryptochromes, which regulate various aspects of plant development  (Liscum et al., 2003). In this study, when the cryptochromes in hemp  perceive blue light, they are activated and produce signals to mediate  the nuclear gene transcriptional through the modulation of transcription  or interaction with the proteasome (Chaves et al., 2011), and finally lead  to the accumulation of biomass and CBD.  
5. Conclusion  
From this study the following conclusions can be reached:  Firstly, wavelengths of LED light can significantly affect the growth  and cannabinoid synthesis and accumulation in hemp; secondly, suit able ratios of red to blue LED light can greatly improve the target  product yield of CBD either through increasing the biomass of inflo rescence or the CBD concentration in inflorescence.
