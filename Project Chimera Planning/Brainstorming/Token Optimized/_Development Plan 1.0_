   * View Hierarchy: Lvl 1: Exterior Shell (white void). Lvl 2: Blueprint View (Top-down/Iso, *Two Point*-style) for layout/expansion. Lvl 3: Room Interior (1st/Close 3rd Person) for placement/interaction. Lvl 4+: Detail Views (Bench, Plant) increasing visual/data granularity.
   * Utility Viz: Early: Visible pipes/wires placed directly. Late: Hidden utilities (walls/floors). "Utility View" Toggle: Overlay ("X-Ray") reveals hidden nets. Visuals: High-detail models; simple flow anims (pulse, color change) for feedback, **not** complex physics sim.
   * Aesthetics/Clutter: Maintain clean/pristine; avoid env grime; manage clutter (space/scaling); organized complexity.
   * Customization/Progression: Early ("Cozy"): Small spaces, layout focus, cosmetic decor. Late ("Professional"): Large sandbox maps, ground-up design, robust construction (grid, freeform walls), material choice.
   * Construction System: Primarily grid (real-world scale), maybe adapt res w/ zoom; advanced stages add freeform; drag-drop placement.
* **Plant Visualization:** Core Goal: Highest visual realism & biological accuracy; primary visual output of GxE sim. Strive max fidelity within engine limits.
   * LOD: Extremely detailed models (leaf shape, stem, bud, trichome, root); visual health/stress indicators.
   * Dynamic Visual Response (GxE Viz): Critical. Changes based on: Genetics (structure, leaf/bud shape, color potential, trichomes), Environment (growth rate, stretch, leaf posture, stress colors), Nutrients (deficiency/excess cues), Health (pest/disease indicators), Growth Stage (clear progression).
   * Procedural Variation/Consistency: Use AI-assisted procedural gen driven by sim data for subtle, plausible variations. Maintain visual consistency in genetic lines; variations logical GxE + slight randomness.
   * Color/Appearance: Realistic colors (genetics/env); trichome density ("frostiness") key quality indicator.
   * Progressive Implementation: Full scope long-term goal. Initial launch: high-quality base models, core responses. Depth evolves iteratively post-launch.
* **UI/UX Aesthetics:** Goal: Modern, clean, sophisticated, visually stunning, intuitive, functional UI/UX. Effective data presentation, no overwhelm; aligns "dark mode".

   * General: Formats: 2D .PNG; 3D .FBX/.GLB/.GLTF; Textures .PNG/.TGA. Naming: Consistent standard (e.g., `AssetType_Name_Variant_Version.format`). Engine: Importable, usable, proper material setup.
   * Textures: Workflow: PBR (Metallic/Roughness preferred); Maps: Albedo, Normal, Metallic, Roughness, AO. Resolution: Appropriate to visibility (e.g., 1K/2K start); optimize via atlasing.
   * 3D Models: Quality: High geo/texture detail; sophisticated, well-crafted. Topology: Clean, efficient geometry (avoid non-manifold); quad-based preferred. UVs: Clean, non-overlapping for PBR; logical seams. Poly Budgets: TBD via performance tests; balance detail vs. perf. LODs: Required for most 3D assets.
   * **Critical Workflow: Manual Optimization:** **Mandate:** All AI 3D assets **must** get manual review/optimization by human artist (Blender/Maya). Tasks: Retopo, UV Unwrap/Correct, LOD Create, Engine compatibility checks. **Raw AI 3D output NOT game-ready**.
* **Do's/Don'ts Summary:** DO: Clean aesthetic; detail equip/UI data; consistent palettes; readability; plant realism/dynamism; subtle UI anims; **mandate manual AI 3D optimiz.**; clear layout. DON'T: Excessive grunge; complex/unreadable data fonts; delaying UI anims; jarring aesthetic inconsistencies; assume raw AI 3D ready; clutter screen; compromise perf for non-core early.

**3. Core Gameplay Mechanics & Simulation**
* **Cultivation Sim Foundation:** Detailed sim of cultivation process, influencing GxE.
   * **Environmental Realism:** Critical Factors: Temp, RH, VPD, CO2, Lighting (PAR & Spectrum), Air Circulation/Exchange. Dynamic Requirements: Optimals change across growth stages (Seedling/Clone, Veg, Early/Mid/Late Flower). Precise control maximizes potential, prevents issues (mold, stress). VPD Importance: Simulating VPD (from Temp/RH) sophisticated player target, reflects advanced techniques. CO2 Enrichment: Optional (1200-1500 PPM) boosts growth (esp. w/ high PAR), needs careful management. Lighting: PAR targets vary (~900 µmols/m²/s high yield); LEDs efficiency/spectrum control; Photoperiod mgmt (18/6 or 24/0 veg, 12/12 flower) crucial for photos. Air Circ: Essential (prevents microclimates, CO2 dist, temp/humidity mgmt); needs fan place / exchange rates (3-5x room vol/hr). (Ref Table 1 summary).
   * **Growing Systems/Nutrients:** Choices: Soil (Std vs. Living/Amended), Coco (Soilless), Hydro (DWC, NFT, Ebb&Flow), Aeroponics. Trade-offs: speed, yield, complexity, cost, control. Nutrient Reqs: Macros (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S), Micros (Fe, Mn, Zn, etc.) essential. NPK Ratios: Change dramatically by stage (High N Veg, High P/K Flower). Cal-Mag often crucial. Measurement (PPM/EC) & pH: Critical (soilless); Target PPM/EC increases thru mid-flower. Optimal pH (5.8-6.5 hydro/coco, 6.0-7.0 soil) vital for uptake, prevents lockout. Delivery/Flushing: Nutrients via irrigation; Pre-harvest flush (water only) common improves quality. (Ref Table 2 summary).
   * **Infrastructure/Physics:** City-Builder Adapt: Zoning, infra place (lights, pipes, ducts), resource route (water, power, nutes), utility mgmt, finances for grow op build. Detailed Construction: Layout design (fixed env: house, warehouse); place structures, irrigation/fertigation (tanks, pipes, pumps, emitters), lighting (type, layout), HVAC/vent (AC, heat, de/humidifiers, fans, ducts), electrical, support rooms (dry, cure, trim). Physics Sim (Feasibility): Fluid Dynamics (Water/Nutes): Full CFD too expensive -> Abstracted model (flow/concentration) recommended. Airflow/HVAC: Full CFD infeasible -> Abstracted model (zones/exchange rates) recommended. Focus: Simulate *impact* on plant env/resources, not perfect fidelity. Resource Mgmt: Track Water, Power, Nutes, CO2, Build Materials, Finances.
   * **Drying/Curing Mechanics:** Importance: Crucial preserves cannabinoids/terpenes, prevents mold, develops final quality. Drying Room: Controlled cool temp (60-70F), mid humidity (50-60% RH), gentle indirect airflow, dark; ~4-14 days. Curing: Store dried buds airtight (weeks/months), stable temp/humid (55-65% RH); needs "burping"/special containers. Trimming: Wet vs. Dry impacts workflow.
* **Genetics & Breeding Engine:** Simulates traits, inheritance, techniques; interacts with cultivation (GxE).
   * **Core Concepts:** Genotype (code) x Environment (cultivation) = Phenotype (observable traits); GxE fundamental. Key Traits: Cannabinoid/Terpene Profiles, Yield Potential, Flower Time, Pest/Disease Resist, Physical Structure, Env Tolerance. Inheritance Model: Simulate Alleles, Dominant/Recessive, Homo/Heterozygous, Co/Incomplete Dominance, **Polygenic Inheritance** (crucial quantitative traits).
   * **Breeding Mechanics:** Core: Select Male + Female -> Cross -> Harvest Seeds -> Grow F1. Pheno-Hunting: Eval offspring phenotypes, select best for clone/breed. Advanced: Backcrossing (BX), Inbreeding (IBL), Selfing (S1), Feminization. Stability vs. Variability: Strategic balance; Inbreeding -> stability (risk depression); Outcrossing -> diversity/vigor (less predict).
   * **Landrace Strains:** Definition: Regionally adapted foundation stock. Role: Rare, unique genetic diversity/alleles essential for novel elite strains. Characteristics: Diverse genetics, unique profiles, high resistance, potentially lower yield/THC vs. optimized modern hybrids.
   * **AI (Evo 2) for Genetic Complexity:** Capability: Predicts mutation effects, generates DNA seqs. Game Integration: **Direct impractical** (compute, data, balance). Recommend: Use principles to inform internal genetics engine or simplified in-game "AI research" features.
* **MMO & AR Elements:**
   * **AR Real-World Discovery (Landraces):** Concept: Mobile GPS/AR finds virtual landraces. Challenges: Tech (GPS, AR stability), Content dist, Safety, Integration. Recommend: **High risk/complexity.** Consider in-game alternatives. **Potentially defer.**.
   * **Player-Driven Marketplace:** Concept: Players trade genetics, equip, resources; price by supply/demand. Design: Robust mechanism (buy/sell orders), clear UI (market data), global vs. regional choice. Economics: Value creation via effort, **essential resource/currency sinks** (taxes, fees, consumption) prevent inflation, balance. Recommend: **High potential, core feature.** Design holistically with sim/breeding.
   * **Monetization:** Recommend: **B2P base + ethical microtransactions**. Suitable MTX: Cosmetics, Marketplace Tax. Caution: Minor Convenience/QoL. Avoid: P2W, Loot Boxes. Focus: Fairness, transparency.

**4. Visual Asset Generation Strategy (AI-Centric)**
* Multi-tool strategy + **hybrid human-AI workflows**, guided by Visual Style Guide (Sec 2).
* **Overall Approach:** Hybrid: AI assists, humans direct/refine/optimize. Style Guide central. **Mandatory Optimization:** All AI 3D assets **must** be manually optimized (retopo, UVs, LODs). Tool Selection: Based on experiments, Style Guide fit, control features.
* **2D Assets:** Primary: Gemini Imagen (concepts). UI Elements: ChatGPT (icons, buttons). Secondary: Leonardo.Ai. Workflow: Define -> Prompt -> Generate -> Select -> Refine (Prompt/Manual) -> Format -> Organize. Future: Layer AI.
* **3D Assets:** Primary: Rodin (Hyper3D).
   * Cannabis Plants (Special): Requires **AI-Assisted Procedural Generation**. Procedural System: Custom framework (driven by game data). AI Role (Rodin): PBR textures, potential base meshes.
   * Equip, Props, Buildings, Env: Rodin primary generator. Manual Optimization: Mandatory. Texturing: Rodin (preferred) or manual. Workflow (Non-Plant): Define -> AI Gen (Rodin) -> **Manual Optimize** -> Texture -> Engine Integration.
* **Animation:** Scope: Env/asset anims, UI/UX anims; **Excludes complex character/creature**. Core Approach: Rely on **engine-native systems** (shaders, particles, UI anim frameworks). AI Role: Limited; Potentially generate **assets** (animated texture/sprite) via image gens; AI *character* anim tools not relevant. Tooling: Master engine-native systems.
* **UI/UX Design:** Layout Ideation: Uizard (preferred). Visual Elements: ChatGPT. Detailed Design: Figma. Implementation: **Manual** functional UI in engine, integrating AI visuals. Style Consistency: Use Style Guide; consider Layer AI later.
* **Visualizing Core Mechanics Summary:** Player Construction: AI (Rodin) gens base env/assets; manual optimiz crucial. Plant Viz: AI-Assist Procedural Gen essential; AI (Rodin) provides textures/bases for procedural sys. MMO Market UI: AI (Uizard, ChatGPT) assists visuals; manual design (Figma) & implement handle functionality.

**5. Pipeline Integration & Management**
* **Workflow Strategy:** Model: Balanced AI Integration (Hybrid Workflow). Engine Integration: Primarily **Direct Asset Import** post-manual optimiz; use engine plugins (e.g., PCG) if beneficial. Pipeline Stages: AI (Concept/Asset Gen) -> Mandatory Human Refine/Optimiz -> Engine.
* **Asset Management/Style Consistency:** Foundation: Style Guide. Tool Choice: Prioritize controllable tools. **Action Required - Implement Rigorously:** Naming Conventions (standardized), Folder Structure (organized hierarchy), Version Control (Git LFS), **Provenance Tracking (Crucial)**: Track tool, prompt, human mods per asset. Process: Consistent prompting, human review checkpoints.
* **Emerging Tech (NeRF & Gaussian Splatting):** Tech: High-fi 3D capture/render. Challenges: Output not game-ready mesh; conversion/render workflows immature for interactive assets. Relevance: **Low current viability** for core pipeline. Recommend: **Monitor developments, do not incorporate for launch**.
