1. Cannabis Biology and Characteristics Parameters (Part 1: Botanical & Chemical)
This section details fundamental biological parameters of the Cannabis sativa L. plant, its morphology, chemistry, and inherent characteristics related to its interaction with the environment and biological threats.
1.1 Botanical Features Parameters
Parameters defining the physical structure, classification, and life cycle stages of the cannabis plant.
* Taxonomy and Classification:
   * Species: Cannabis sativa L. [1]
   * Subspecies/Varieties: sativa, indica, ruderalis.
      * Note: Traditional classifications may not correlate perfectly with genetic structure [2, 3]. Cultivator experience suggests that even within these, traits like stretch and nutrient preference can vary significantly (Transcript P.114, P.196). For example, some OG cuts have minimal lateral branching (Transcript P.182-183).
   * Hemp vs. Drug-type distinction: Based on THC content (e.g., <0.3% Δ⁹-THC for hemp) [1]. This is a critical botanical and regulatory parameter [1] (Transcript P.2, P.276-277).
      * Range: % Δ⁹-THC can range from negligible (<0.1%) in some hemp varieties to over 30% in high-potency drug-type cultivars [4-6]. Some cultivars test around 15-19% THC, while others can reach 28-35% THC (Transcript P.187, P.197). THCA flower is also a market factor under hemp regulations (Transcript P.276-279).
   * Chemovars: Classification based on cannabinoid profile [7, 8] (e.g., Type I: THC-dominant, Type II: THC/CBD mixed, Type III: CBD-dominant, Type IV: CBG-dominant, Type V: negligible cannabinoids) [2].
      * Game should support differentiation based on chemical profile rather than just traditional labels [2]. Consumer markets show preferences for different profiles; e.g., some European markets value specific terpene expressions over pure THC content (Transcript P.192).
* Morphology: Parameters defining the physical structure and form of the plant.
   * Plant Height: Potential range (e.g., 0.2m to >12m cultivated) [1]. Influenced by genetics and environment [1].
      * Hemp types tend to be taller and less branched, drug-types bushier [1, 9].
      * Range: Dwarf varieties can be 0.2m [1]. Fiber hemp can exceed 12m [1].
      * Drug types typically range from 0.5m to over 3m. Some strains can stretch significantly, e.g., a 12-inch plant stretching to 5 feet (Transcript P.114). Sherb Banger 22 known for a 4-week stretch period (Transcript P.114-115).
   * Stem Structure: Erect, furrows, branching patterns, woody interior, hollow internodes [1].
      * Stem diameter can range from 1-3cm in mature plants, influenced by genetics and vigor [13].
      * Base can become very big and thick [14].
      * Branching Pattern: Influenced by genetics and environment (e.g., apical dominant, lateral spread, balanced) [15]. Sativa-like strains tend to have more lateral branching. Some OG cuts show minimal lateral branching without topping (Transcript P.182-183). HLVd infection can cause abnormal, horizontal branching (Transcript P.80).
      * Sativas tend to have more lanky branches, Indicas more compact [16-18].
   * Leaf Morphology: Compound leaves with leaflets radiating from the petiole end [1].
      * Leaflet Number: Number of leaflets (e.g., 3-13) [1].
      * Developmental sequence: 1 (seedlings/stressed), 3, 5, 7, 9, then potentially more (up to 13+) on robust mature plants, decreasing later [19].
      * Leaflet Shape: Lanceolate, ovoid, oblanceolate [1]. Influenced by genetics (e.g., broad in Indica types, narrow in Sativa types) [19].
      * Serrated margins [1].
      * Leaf Size: Broad (Indica) vs. long/slender (Sativa) [19].
      * Changes throughout lifecycle, peaking around the 12th node [19].
      * Leaf Angle/Droop: Angle relative to stem, turgidity.
         * Heavily influenced by hydration (underwatered-drooping) [13, 20]. Genetics may influence baseline angle [13]. Hybrids show a spectrum [13]. HLVd may cause leaves to curl or appear malformed (Transcript P.80).
      * Diagnostic Leaf Venation [1].
   * Leaf Arrangement: Opposite (lower nodes) to alternate (main stem) [1, 19].
      * Phyllotaxy shift typically occurs around the 12th node [19].
   * Bud/Flower Structure: Shape (e.g., conical, spear, round, "golf balls" (Transcript P.181), foxtail), density (airy, medium, compact, "rock-hard" under LEDs (Transcript P.202)), leaf-to-calyx ratio [15].
      * Indica types tend to have dense, compact buds, Sativa types longer, airy buds [11, 16].
      * Foxtailing can occur, sometimes accelerating towards harvest [21]. Some strains exhibit foxtailing as a genetic trait, not necessarily negative (Transcript P.120).
      * HLVd can cause "dudding" or significantly reduced bud development and trichome production (Transcript P.80, P.171).
   * Pistil Color (Mature): Colors such as orange-red, pink-purple, brown [15].
   * Trichome Density: Potential levels (low, medium, high) [15].
      * A key visual quality indicator (frostiness, resin) [15, 22, 23]. Influenced by genetics and environment [15, 24, 25]. Some strains are known for high resin production suitable for hash (Transcript P.9, P.21).
      * Can vary dramatically between strains [24]. Use of products like Athena Stack can visually increase trichome production (Transcript P.160).
   * Trichome Appearance: Transition in color (clear to milky to brown/amber) indicates maturity [15, 22, 26].
      * Visual cues for resin and ripeness [15, 22, 26]. Trichomes contain cannabinoids [24]. For hash production, plants might be harvested earlier when trichomes are optimal for separation (e.g., day 40 for a 70-day flower strain) (Transcript P.197).
   * Trichome Degradation: Can be induced by experiments [27]. Poor storage can lead to reduced trichome vibrancy [28, 29]. Improper drying/curing can lead to terpene loss (Transcript P.179).
   * Root System: Adaptable taproot with lateral branching [1].
      * Can reach up to 2.5m deep in soil depending on soil/water [1, 30].
      * Root health and development influenced by growing media [30, 31]. HLVd can be present in roots (Transcript P.83). Fusarium also infects through roots (Transcript P.84).
      * Plants from seed have a strong, deep taproot; cloned plants typically have weaker, more lateral, not as deep roots [32].
      * Rootbound plants stress plant if left untreated [33].
      * Root restriction (small containers) stunts growth, limits nutrient/water uptake, alters structure [30, 34, 35]. Smaller pots (e.g., 1-2 gallons) preferred by some for more control with frequent irrigations (Transcript P.127).
   * Visual Representation: Potential for root system visualization showing medium, water, nutrient response [36].
   * Fruit (Achene)/Seed: <3.8mm length, often in persistent perianth (mottled/marbled) [1]. Seed production can yield 5,000 to over 20,000 seeds per light depending on cultivation methods and nutrient lines (Transcript P.309). Shipping seeds is generally legal, but banking for seed sales can be problematic (Transcript P.2). Cuttings/clones shipping legality is evolving, based on <0.3% THC in the cutting itself (Transcript P.1-2, P.276-277).
* Sex Determination:
   * Predominantly dioecious (separate male (XY)/female (XX) plants) [1, 37]. Females are valued for cannabinoids in inflorescences [37].
   * Monoecious/Hermaphroditic forms: Can occur naturally (stress-induced, e.g., light leaks, temperature swings (Transcript P.158, P.171)) or be chemically induced (e.g., silver thiosulfate, STS (Transcript P.169)) for breeding [37].
      * Hermaphroditism involves producing both male and female flowers on the same plant, leading to "seeded" crops [38, 39]. Some strains have a higher genetic predisposition to herm under stress (e.g., Dante's Inferno #6) (Transcript P.152). Sterility of pollen from hermaphroditic plants can vary (Transcript P.152).
* Growth Stages:
   * Germination: First physiological stage [40].
      * Requires proper medium temperature (8-10°C average daily minimum for outdoor sowing, or specific ranges for in vitro/controlled) [41, 42].
      * Light not required [42]. Influenced by genetics, physical factors (medium composition, env conditions) [40].
      * Optimal conditions and quality seeds yield 80-100% germination [43]. Poor germination rates can be associated with bad genetics [44] or old seeds (Transcript P.168).
      * Range/Likely Level: Germination rate can be affected by genotype, medium composition, and environmental conditions [40, 43]. Reputable breeders aim for near 100% [43].
   * Seedling: Early growth [45, 46].
      * Typically single leaflet leaves initially, progressing to 3, then 5 [19]. Sensitive stage [47].
   * Vegetative: Rapid growth stage, building root system and stems, then foliage [46, 48].
      * Needs high nitrogen [46, 49]. Fairly tough during this stage [50]. Environmental conditions like temp/humidity deviations impact growth speed [51]. Optimal VPD is crucial (Transcript P.235). Low light (e.g. 200s PPFD) can be sufficient if DLI is met (Transcript P.161). Veg duration varies (e.g., 10-18 days for some commercial setups (Transcript P.176, P.217), up to 5-6 weeks for others (Transcript P.200)).
      * Problems often begin to show here [52]. Duration modeled as 50 days in one facility example [53].
   * Flowering: Stage where inflorescences develop [45, 46].
      * Requires lower humidity (especially late flower, e.g. 40-50% RH, though some run higher at 60-65% with LEDs (Transcript P.161)) and specific light spectrum/intensity [47]. Needs higher phosphorus/potassium [45, 49]. Light cycle typically 12/12, but some manipulate to 11/13 to finish plants or influence expression (Transcript P.115).
      * Longest stage in one model (57 days) [53]. Can range from 7 weeks (e.g., Rainbow Belts, Zkittlez crosses (Transcript P.115)) to 10+ weeks (e.g., Haze varieties, some OGs (Transcript P.115, P.169, P.308)) depending on genetics. Stretch period (first 1-4 weeks of flower) can last 3-4 weeks for some strains (e.g., Sherb Banger 22 (Transcript P.114-115)).
   * Maturation: Buds thicken, trichomes mature [21, 27].
      * Harvest timing determined by trichome appearance (clear to milky to amber) and yield/chemistry correlation [54]. Cannabinoid and terpene profiles change during maturation (Transcript P.8, P.172). Some harvest earlier for specific products like hash (Transcript P.197).
   * Harvest: Physical removal of plants/flowers [55]. Timing crucial for potency/quality [54, 56].
* Phenotypic Plasticity: The ability of a plant with a specific genotype to exhibit different phenotypes in different environments [38, 57-60].
   * This is a fundamental concept for GxE modeling [38, 57-60]. Environment (light, temp, nutrients, stress) heavily influences expression of genetic potential (Transcript P.187, P.200-207).
   * Clones with identical genotype can show different phenotypes with varied conditions [3, 58].
1.2 Chemical Profile Parameters
Parameters defining the chemical composition of the cannabis plant, particularly secondary metabolites produced primarily in glandular trichomes [4, 24, 61].
* Cannabinoids: (>140 identified) [62].
   * Major Cannabinoids:
      * Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC): Psychoactive compound [63].
         * Potency often measured as % DW [64]. Levels up to 25-30% of floral dry weight achieved [4]. Some cultivars testing at 28-35% THC reported (Transcript P.187). Others may test lower (e.g. 12-19%) but still be desirable (Transcript P.170, P.197). Moisture content at testing significantly impacts reported THC % (Transcript P.12, P.22).
         * Can reach 30% in some plants [5].
         * Likely Levels: High THC strains can exceed 20%, some even reaching 30% [4-6]. Cultivator discussions mention THC levels from 12% to 35%+ (Transcript P.13, P.170, P.187, P.197).
         * Traditional hemp is <0.3% [1]. THCA flower market exists under hemp definition (Transcript P.276-279).
      * Cannabidiol (CBD): Non-psychoactive, therapeutic potential [63, 65].
         * Potency often measured as % DW [64].
         * Likely Levels: High CBD strains can exceed 15-20%. Many hybrids have mixed ratios.
      * Cannabigerol (CBG): Precursor to other cannabinoids [63]. Increasing interest in breeding [66].
      * Cannabinol (CBN): Sedative effects [63]. Accumulates with degradation/aging [63].
   * Minor Cannabinoids: Growing interest (distinct therapeutic benefits) [66].
      * Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV): Investigating production genetics crucial [66].
      * Cannabidivarin (CBDV): Investigating production genetics crucial [66].
      * Cannabichromene (CBC): Investigating production genetics crucial [66].
      * Cannabichromenevarin (CBCV) [63].
      * Cannabigerovarin (CBGV) [63].
      * Delta-8 THC [63], Delta-10 THC [63], HHC [63]: Novel cannabinoids often in legal grey areas, facing evolving scrutiny [67]. Delta-8 can be synthesized from CBD (Transcript P.279-281).
      * THCP, THCB [63].
   * Cannabinoid Acids: Biosynthetic precursors, convert to neutral form via decarboxylation (heat, aging) [63, 68, 69].
      * THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) [63]. THCA flower being sold under hemp regulations is a major market factor (Transcript P.276-279).
      * CBDA (cannabidiolic acid) [63].
      * CBGA (cannabigerolic acid) [63].
   * Total Cannabinoids (e.g., Total THC: THCA * 0.877 + THC, Total CBD: CBDA * 0.877 + CBD) [63].
      * Critical quality parameters [68]. Content variability in plant material is an issue for consistency [68].
      * Can reach 25-30% of floral dry weight [4]. Potency is a key driver in many markets, though this is being questioned by connoisseurs (Transcript P.170, P.197, P.239). Moisture content at testing significantly impacts reported THC % (Transcript P.12, P.22). Using products like "Fade" can increase THC by 2-6% absolute (Transcript P.13).
* Terpenes: (>120 identified) [62].
   * Aromatic compounds contributing to aroma, flavor, and potential effects (entourage effect) [63, 65, 70]. Produced in glandular trichomes [61]. Critical for consumer preference, especially in connoisseur markets (Transcript P.8, P.152, P.179, P.192).
   * Concentration influenced by genetics, environment, post-harvest handling [71]. Late-stage nutrient protocols (like "Fade") can enhance terpene expression (Transcript P.8-9). Drying and curing are critical for terpene preservation (Transcript P.179, P.298-299).
   * Dominant Terpenes: Myrcene, Limonene, Caryophyllene, Pinene, Ocimene, Terpinolene [63].
   * Other Terpenes: Humulene, Linalool, Bisabolol, Nerolidol, Geraniol, Borneol, Fenchol, Cineole, Camphor, Phellandrene, Terpineol, Carene, Farnesene, Phytol, Carvacrol, Aromadendrene, Eudesmol [63].
   * Terpene Profiles: Concentrations and ratios of individual terpenes [64, 65, 71]. Contributes to market demand [71]. Breeding for unique terpene profiles is a major goal for some (Transcript P.152, P.172).
   * System for classification (e.g., Cream/Cake/Cookies/Candy, Fruity, Herbal, Pine, Skunk, Spicy, Sweet, Tropical, Woody/Earth) [72]. The "candy" profile (e.g., from Dante's Inferno #6) is currently popular (Transcript P.152, P.172). "Gas" is another popular profile (Transcript P.187).
   * Total Terpenes [63]. High terpene content is desirable but can be diluted by excessive yield focus ("yield dilution") (Transcript P.62).
   * Volatilization: Terpenes can volatilize, especially during drying/curing at warmer temperatures [73].
      * Proper drying/curing crucial for retention [25, 54, 73]. Target 7-10 days dry time, 60F/60%RH environment (Transcript P.298-299).
* Flavonoids: Contribute to pigmentation and aroma/flavor [8, 63].
   * Cannflavins [63]. Anthocyanins responsible for purple colors, influenced by genetics and cold temperatures (Transcript P.14-15).
* Volatile Sulfur Compounds (VSCs): Contribute to pungent/characteristic notes like "gas" or "skunk" [63]. Unstable over time [63].
* Esters: Contribute sweet/fruity notes [63].
* Other Constituents: Hydrocarbons, phenolics, sugars [63].
* Entourage Effect: Synergistic interaction between cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds influencing effects and therapeutic potential [8, 63].
1.3 Physiological Processes Parameters (Continuation)
Parameters governing the internal functions and responses of the cannabis plant, building on the initial photosynthesis, transpiration, nutrient uptake, and biosynthesis parameters.
* Water Relations: Beyond basic transpiration.
   * Water Uptake Rate: Influenced by root system size/health, substrate moisture content, substrate type (e.g., coir's high water retention vs. rockwool's quick dry down) [1-3]. VPD heavily influences uptake (Transcript P.125, P.235).
   * Aquaporin activity (e.g., PIP aquaporins) may play a role at a molecular level [2].
   * Leaf Water Potential: Measure of plant water stress. Influenced by substrate moisture, humidity, airflow, transpiration rate.
   * Stomatal Response: Opening and closing of stomata to regulate gas exchange and water loss.
      * Influenced by light intensity, CO2 levels, humidity, wind. Can be reduced in later maturation stages [4]. Far-red light at end of day can influence stomatal closure and plant sleep cycles (Transcript P.203).
* Carbon Metabolism:
   * Carbon Fixation Rate: Directly related to photosynthetic rate.
   * Photoassimilate Production: Synthesis of sugars.
   * Photoassimilate Partitioning: Allocation of sugars to different plant parts (roots, shoots, leaves, flowers).
      * Influenced by growth stage, nutrient availability (e.g., Nitrogen for vegetative growth vs. Phosphorus for flowering/bud development) [5]. Late flower N restriction (e.g., using "Fade") encourages resource allocation to flowers (Transcript P.7-9, P.15).
* Hormonal Regulation: Internal plant hormones (phytohormones) play crucial roles in growth, development, and responses to environment and stress.
   * Auxins: Involved in root development, apical dominance, vegetative growth. Auxin activity typically decreases during flowering transition [6].
   * Cytokinins: Promote cell division, shoot development. Certain cytokinins increase during flowering transition [6].
      * Meta-topolin (mT), a natural cytokinin, is effective for shoot proliferation in tissue culture [7].
   * Gibberellins: Involved in stem elongation (e.g., "stretch" at flowering onset) [6].
   * Abscisic Acid (ABA): Stress hormone, involved in stomatal closure and dormancy. Increases under drought stress. Drought stress (generative steering) is a key crop steering technique (Transcript P.122-123).
   * Ethylene: Involved in senescence, ripening, stress responses.
   * Brassinosteroids: Promote growth and stress tolerance.
   * Phytohormone Balance: The relative levels and interactions of these hormones regulate developmental transitions (e.g., vegetative to flowering, re-vegetation) [6, 8].
      * Mother plants in long-term vegetative state may experience subtle changes in hormonal balance [4].
* Nutrient Mobility and Translocation: Movement of absorbed nutrients within the plant (e.g., from older leaves to new growth/flowers).
   * Efficiency may diminish with physiological age [4]. Nitrogen is highly mobile and translocated from fan leaves during late flower if root zone N is restricted (e.g. when using "Fade") (Transcript P.8, P.15). Calcium is immobile; deficiencies (e.g., from flushing with straight RO water or pulling Core too early) can lead to issues like bud rot (Transcript P.7-8, P.12).
* Resource Remobilization: Breakdown of macromolecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids) in senescing tissues and transport of resulting nutrients to other parts of the plant [9].
   * Occurs in older leaves even in vegetative mothers [4]. Crucial for reproductive success in nature [9]. This is a key mechanism during "Fade" or flushing (Transcript P.8, P.15).
* Developmental Plasticity: Ability to alter growth patterns in response to environmental cues (e.g., branching patterns influenced by light distribution, nutrient availability) [10].
* Circadian Rhythms: Internal biological clock regulating daily physiological processes (e.g., photosynthesis, transpiration, flowering time). Interacts with photoperiod. Use of far-red light to signal end-of-day can influence these rhythms (Transcript P.203).
1.4 Stress Responses Parameters
Parameters defining how the cannabis plant reacts to and is affected by various abiotic and biotic stressors, and its ability to tolerate them. Stress can impact yield, quality, and even chemotype. Strategic stress (e.g., controlled drought, specific nutrient withdrawal like "Fade") can enhance desired traits like terpene and cannabinoid production (Transcript P.8, P.122-124).
* Abiotic Stress Responses: Responses to non-living environmental factors.
   * Drought Stress: (Intentional for generative steering)
      * Physiological Effects: Reduced stomatal conductance, decreased photosynthesis, wilting, reduced transpiration.
      * Can induce changes in leaf water potential [11]. Induces hormonal responses for survival and reproduction (Transcript P.122).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced biomass, lower flower yield.
      * Controlled drought stress in flowering stage can increase inflorescence dry weight and cannabinoid content [12]. Key part of "generative steering" by manipulating drybacks (Transcript P.11, P.122-123).
      * Chemotype Effects: May increase cannabinoid/terpene concentration (due to reduced biomass/water content or stress-induced synthesis) or decrease total production (due to reduced metabolic activity) [11, 13]. (Transcript P.8, P.124).
      * Stress-induced synthesis vs. dilution [13].
   * Heat Stress:
      * Physiological Effects: Denaturation of enzymes, impaired photosynthesis, increased respiration, heat shock protein production.
      * Can cause managing temperature to be critical for quality [14]. Excessive heat can stress plants, leading to reduced quality or hermaphroditism (Transcript P.158, P.171).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced flower development, wilting, leaf damage.
      * Chemotype Effects: Can degrade cannabinoids (e.g., THC) and volatilize terpenes, reducing overall potency and aroma profile [14].
   * Cold Stress:
      * Physiological Effects: Reduced enzymatic activity, membrane damage, impaired nutrient uptake.
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, leaf damage, reduced yield.
      * Chemotype Effects: Can impact cannabinoid/terpene synthesis.
      * Some varieties may show color changes (e.g., purple hues) in response to cold [15]. This is a common technique to enhance "bag appeal" (Transcript P.14-15). Colder water at end of flower can also induce color (Transcript P.14).
   * Light Stress (Too High/Low Intensity):
      * Physiological Effects: Photoinhibition (damage to photosynthetic apparatus) from excessive light [16].
      * Reduced photosynthesis from insufficient light. Plants growing into lights will burn (Transcript P.114).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Leaf burn, stunted growth, reduced yield from excessive light.
      * Leggy growth, low yield from insufficient light.
      * Chemotype Effects: Optimal light intensity and spectrum are crucial for cannabinoid and terpene production [17-19]. Some genetics are more sensitive to high PPFD than others (e.g., old Indicas) (Transcript P.116).
      * UV light can stimulate cannabinoid production (protective mechanism) [20, 21], but excessive UV can be damaging.
      * Different light spectra affect morphological, physiological, and chemical parameters [17, 22]. Far-red can influence flowering time and stretch (Transcript P.203). Mixed HPS/LED can give unique expressions (Transcript P.202-207).
   * Nutrient Deficiency/Toxicity:
      * Physiological Effects: Impaired metabolic processes, reduced photosynthesis, visible symptoms (e.g., leaf yellowing from N deficiency, brown spots from P deficiency/toxicity, leaf burn from nutrient excess/toxicity) [23, 24]. Calcium deficiency in late flower can lead to bud rot (Transcript P.7-8).
      * Can trigger/accelerate senescence [25]. Removing core nutrients (e.g., Athena ProLine Core) too early or using straight RO water can cause deficiencies (Transcript P.8, P.12).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced biomass, lower yield [5, 23, 24].
      * Nutrient imbalance can restrict development [26]. Overwatering can lead to nutrient lockout or root issues mistaken for deficiencies (Transcript P.11).
      * Chemotype Effects: Nutrient availability significantly impacts cannabinoid and terpene biosynthesis and concentration [18, 27, 28].
      * High Nitrogen can decrease cannabinoid/terpene concentration while increasing biomass (dilution effect) [5, 29]. This is a reason for products like "Fade" (Transcript P.7-9).
      * Phosphorus is conventionally supplied at high amounts for optimal function and yield, but deficiency at vegetative stage impacts functional phenotyping and ionome [30].
   * Waterlogged Soil/Root Zone Hypoxia:
      * Physiological Effects: Root damage, impaired nutrient/water uptake, reduced oxygen availability to roots. Increased risk with overwatering, especially in dense media like coco if not managed (Transcript P.11, P.126).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Wilting, stunted growth, root rot susceptibility [31], reduced yield.
      * Chemotype Effects: Reduced plant health negatively impacts secondary metabolite production.
   * Salinity Stress: Accumulation of soluble salts in the root zone, particularly in hydroponics/soilless media [26]. High EC in media due to insufficient runoff or excessive drybacks (Transcript P.123, P.158).
      * Physiological Effects: Impaired water uptake, ion toxicity.
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced yield. Lockout of other nutrients.
      * Chemotype Effects: Can impact metabolite profiles. Extreme EC can burn plants.
* Biotic Stress Responses: Responses to living organisms.
   * Pest Infestation: (See also 1.6 Pest/Disease Resistance Parameters)
      * Damage Types: Feeding damage (leaf loss, tissue damage), disease transmission, growth hindrance [32, 33]. Thrips, mites mentioned as common problems (Transcript P.80, P.179).
      * Physiological Effects: Allocation of resources to defense mechanisms (e.g., production of defensive compounds).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Reduced vigor, stunted growth, significant yield loss [32, 33].
      * Trichome damage/loss can directly reduce cannabinoid/terpene yield [34].
   * Pathogen Infection: (See also 1.6 Pest/Disease Resistance Parameters)
      * Damage Types: Tissue damage, impaired physiological function (e.g., nutrient/water transport, photosynthesis), systemic infection [32, 35]. Bud rot (Botrytis) is a major concern, linked to calcium deficiency and high humidity (Transcript P.7-8, P.15). Fusarium is a root pathogen, no cure, spreads via water (Transcript P.84). HLVd causes stunting, dudding, reduced quality (Transcript P.3, P.16, P.80, P.171).
      * Physiological Effects: Activation of plant immune response, production of defense compounds.
      * Older mothers may have potentially weakened immune response or chronic stress leading to higher susceptibility [34].
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Reduced vigor, stunted growth, wilting, necrosis, significant yield loss [32, 35]. HLVd can devastate crops (Transcript P.3, P.16-17).
      * Can be mistaken for age-related decline [34]. Systemic pathogens like HLVd cause stunting and reduced trichome production/yields [34].
   * Competition (Light, Nutrients, Water, Space): Competition from other cannabis plants or companion plants [36].
      * Physiological Effects: Altered growth patterns (e.g., reaching for light), reduced resource uptake efficiency.
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Reduced individual plant yield. Plant spacing is important for maximizing yield per area [37, 38]. Density of 1.6 plants/sq ft mentioned (Transcript P.183).
   * Stress-Induced Senescence: Premature aging and death of plant tissues or the whole plant due to severe or prolonged stress [9]. Can be desirable at end of flower (e.g., with "Fade") but problematic if premature (Transcript P.8).
1.5 Strain-Specific Optimal Conditions and Characteristics Parameters
Parameters defining the variations in optimal growth conditions, growth habits, and other characteristics between different cannabis genotypes (strains/cultivars). Cultivars show wide variation in response to environment and inputs (Transcript P.114, P.163, P.187, P.200).
* Optimal Environmental Ranges: Genotype-dependent ideal ranges for:
   * Temperature: Specific optimal temperature ranges for vegetative and flowering stages [39]. Some strains are more sensitive to temperature swings (Transcript P.15, P.158). Some growers run 73-76F even in late flower with "Fade" (Transcript P.15).
   * Humidity: Specific optimal humidity ranges for vegetative and flowering stages [39]. Some strains are more prone to mold in high humidity (Transcript P.15). Some run 60-65% RH with LEDs in flower (Transcript P.161).
   * Light Intensity (PPFD): Different strains may utilize light more or less efficiently and have different saturation points. Some strains are sensitive to high PPFD (e.g. old indicas) (Transcript P.116).
   * Light Spectrum: Different strains may respond differently to specific light wavelengths [17, 22, 39]. Some strains show better color or terpene expression under specific spectra (e.g. mixed HPS/LED, or specific LED spectra like ThinkGrow vs. Luxx) (Transcript P.202-207, P.113, P.160). Far-red for end-of-day signal (Transcript P.203).
   * CO2 Concentration: Optimal CO2 levels for different strains, especially in CEA [39-41]. Typically 1500ppm in flower (Transcript P.161).
   * Airflow/Ventilation: Specific needs for different growth structures and densities to prevent mold/pests [42]. Dense bud structures require more airflow (Transcript P.15).
   * Substrate Moisture Content: Optimal levels and tolerance for drying out or waterlogging vary [1-3]. Some strains prefer larger drybacks than others (Transcript P.11, P.124). Rockwool vs. Coco drydown characteristics (Transcript P.113, P.180).
   * Nutrient Solution pH: Optimal pH range for nutrient uptake can vary slightly by strain and substrate [16, 43, 44]. Some growers maintain a consistent pH (e.g. 6.0-6.2) for all strains in coco (Transcript P.158). Monosilicic acid can affect pH in rockwool (Transcript P.11).
   * Nutrient Concentrations (EC/PPM): Optimal nutrient strength varies by strain and growth stage [27, 43, 45]. Some strains are heavy feeders, others sensitive (e.g., OGs might prefer lower EC than Runtz; Runtz sensitive to high EC, Pie Hoe can take very high EC) (Transcript P.196). Some run 3.0 EC all the way through with Athena ProLine (Transcript P.12, P.15).
   * Specific Nutrient Ratios (NPK, Ca:Mg, etc.): Optimal ratios can be strain-specific and outcome-specific (e.g., maximizing yield vs. maximizing cannabinoid concentration) [13, 27, 45].
* Growth Habits and Morphology: Genotype-dependent traits:
   * Plant Height and Structure: Tall/thin (sativa-like) vs. short/bushy (indica-like) [10, 47, 48]. Some strains have significant stretch (e.g. Sherb Banger 22, 4-week stretch from 12" to 5ft (Transcript P.114-115)) while others are short (e.g. Rainbow Belts, Zkittlez finishing in 7 weeks (Transcript P.115)).
   * Branching patterns (apical dominant vs. lateral spread, OG minimal lateral without topping) [10] (Transcript P.182-183). Untopped plants develop a main cola with lateral branches reaching near the top (Transcript P.183).
   * Internodal spacing [49].
   * Leaf Morphology: Leaflet number and width (narrow-leaf vs. broad-leaf) [49, 50].
   * Flower Structure: Shape, density, leaf-to-calyx ratio [10, 51]. Some genetics known for specific structures (e.g. "golf balls" (Transcript P.181)). Some LED-grown flower can be rock-hard (Transcript P.202).
   * Root System Development: Efficiency and structure of the root system can be strain-specific [3]. Cloned plants have weaker, more lateral roots than seed plants (Transcript P.32).
* Life Cycle and Flowering Time: Genotype-dependent duration of growth stages:
   * Seedling Stage Duration [10, 54].
   * Vegetative Stage Duration: Ability to remain vegetative under specific photoperiods [10, 55, 56]. Commercial grows may have veg times from 10-18 days (Transcript P.176, P.217) to several weeks (Transcript P.200).
   * Flowering Time/Duration: Crucial parameter for breeding and cultivation planning [10, 39, 57, 58]. Ranges from 7 weeks (e.g. some Zkittlez crosses (Transcript P.115)) to 10+ weeks (e.g. Haze varieties, some OGs (Transcript P.115, P.169, P.308)).
   * Sativa varieties typically have longer flowering times (10-16 weeks) than indica (6-10 weeks) [10, 57]. Photoperiod-dependent flowering vs. autoflowering [59-61]. Use of far-red light can shorten flowering time by a week or more (Transcript P.204).
   * Semi-full-term/fast-flowering strains [62, 63].
   * Maturation Indicators: Visual cues (pistil color, trichome appearance) indicating peak ripeness can vary slightly by strain [10, 64-66].
   * Trichome gland head phenotypes change over the flowering period [67]. Optimal harvest timing varies by strain [68]. For hash production, plants might be harvested earlier (e.g. day 40 for a 70-day flower strain) (Transcript P.197).
   * Re-vegetation Potential: Ability to revert to vegetative growth after flowering can be strain-dependent [6, 69].
   * Older plants may struggle more [69].
* Yield Potential: Genotype-dependent inherent capacity for biomass and flower production under optimal conditions.
   * Measured in grams per plant or grams per square foot [65]. Can be influenced by substrate choice [1, 3]. Yields of 2.5-4 lbs per light reported by cultivators (Transcript P.116, P.204). Some strains are known low yielders (e.g. cookies, lcg) but high value (Transcript P.116, P.241). Under canopy lighting can increase yield by 20-50% (Transcript P.225). Hash yields also vary (e.g., 3% vs 4-5.5% with Fade) (Transcript P.9).
* Chemical Profile (Chemovar): Genotype-dependent production of specific cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds, defining the chemovar [70-73]. Huge driver of market value (Transcript P.152, P.170).
   * Major Cannabinoid Ratios (THC:CBD, THC:CBG, CBD:CBG, etc.) [28, 74].
   * Controlled by alleles at cannabinoid synthase loci [74, 75]. Breeding can target specific ratios [76, 77].
   * Minor Cannabinoid Production (THCV, CBDV, CBG, CBC, CBN, etc.) [72, 78, 79]. Genetics control production [76, 77].
   * Terpene Profile: Specific terpenes produced and their relative concentrations [72, 73, 78, 80, 81]. Unique terpene profiles are highly sought after (e.g. Dante's Inferno #6 cherry candy (Transcript P.152, P.172)).
   * Genetics are foundational, but expression influenced by environment and post-harvest [82]. Terpene synthase (TPS) genes are involved [45, 79].
   * Unique flavor/aroma profiles are strain-defining [58, 80, 83]. "Gas" and "candy" profiles are popular (Transcript P.172, P.187).
   * Flavonoid Production (Cannflavins, Anthocyanins for color) [78, 84] (Transcript P.14-15).
   * Total Cannabinoid Potency (% DW) [71, 74, 78]. THC levels are often a primary market driver, but this is shifting (Transcript P.170, P.197, P.239).
   * Total Terpene Content [78].
   * Stability of Chemical Profile: Consistency across different grows/environments (less plastic chemotypes) [85, 86].
   * Desirable for medicinal/commercial purposes [18, 71, 85, 87]. Influenced by genetic stability and environmental control [71, 88].
* Propagation Characteristics:
   * Seed Germination Rate and Speed [10, 89, 90]. Old seeds may have poor germination (Transcript P.168).
   * Cloning Success Rate: Ease of rooting cuttings, influenced by genetics and mother plant health [25, 91]. Some strains are notoriously difficult to clone.
   * Tissue Culture Recalcitrance: Difficulty of in vitro regeneration and transformation for certain genotypes [48, 92, 93].
   * Genotype-dependent HLVd eradication success in meristem culture [94]. (Transcript P.17-18, P.81).
   * Doubled Haploid (DH) Production Recalcitrance: Difficulty in generating homozygous lines rapidly [41, 93].
* Responses to Cultivation Techniques: Different strains may respond better or worse to specific methods.
   * Pruning and Training (e.g., Topping, LST, ScrOG, SOG): Effectiveness for yield and structure optimization can be strain-dependent [91, 95-98]. Some growers prefer no topping to encourage a dominant main cola and specific canopy structures (Transcript P.182-183). Stretch characteristics heavily influence training needs (Transcript P.114). Defoliation timing and extent interact with nutrient strategies like "Fade" (Transcript P.12, P.15-16).
   * Fertigation/Nutrient Management: Optimal nutrient timing, strength, and ratios may differ [13, 26, 27, 43, 45]. Some strains (e.g. Runtz) are sensitive to high EC, while others (e.g. Pie Hoe) can take very high EC (Transcript P.196). OGs might prefer lower EC (Transcript P.196).
   * Nutrient Use Efficiency (NUE) varies [45, 99].
   * Substrate Suitability: Performance can vary significantly across different substrates (soil, coco coir, peat mixes, rockwool, hydroponics) and may be genotype-specific [2, 3, 31]. Some strains might prefer the buffering of coco over the rapid changes in rockwool (Transcript P.116, P.180).
* Desired Effects/Applications: While influenced by environment and post-harvest, the genetic chemotype provides the basis for different effects and applications [72, 86, 100-103].
   * Recreational Effects: Energetic/cerebral (sativa-like) vs. relaxing/sedative (indica-like) [47, 102].
   * While traditional Sativa/Indica labels are not fully reliable for genetic structure [59, 104, 105], market categorizations persist based on perceived effects [47, 102].
   * Entourage effect plays a role [78, 106-109].
   * Medical Applications: Specific cannabinoid/terpene profiles are sought for therapeutic outcomes (e.g., high CBD for certain conditions) [85, 101, 110].
   * Tailored chemotypes for medicinal needs [111].
1.6 Pest/Disease Resistance Parameters
Parameters defining a strain's inherent ability to resist common pests and diseases.
* Resistance Levels: Genotype-dependent inherent resistance or susceptibility to:
   * Fungal Diseases (e.g., Powdery Mildew (PM), Bud Rots like Botrytis, Root/Crown Rots like Fusarium/Pythium) [32, 33, 112, 113]. Botrytis is a significant issue, especially with dense buds or under LED lights if humidity is not managed. Calcium deficiency can exacerbate botrytis (Transcript P.7-8, P.15). Fusarium is a concern in hydroponic/recirculating systems, no cure, spreads via water (Transcript P.84). PM resistance is a highly desirable trait (Transcript P.79).
   * Mold resistance is a crucial agronomic trait [114]. Strains from humid regions may have higher mold resistance [58].
   * Bacterial Diseases [32, 33].
   * Viral Pathogens (e.g., Hop Latent Viroid - HLVd) [32, 33]. HLVd resistance varies by genotype [94]. Some strains may be asymptomatic carriers (Transcript P.80-81). Symptoms include stunting, dudding, brittle stems, abnormal branching, reduced trichomes/yield/quality (Transcript P.3, P.16, P.80, P.171). Spreads via mechanical damage (tools, hands) (Transcript P.80). Present in roots (Transcript P.83). Can be in seeds (unconfirmed for cannabis, Tumi studying) (Transcript P.17, P.81).
   * Nematode Infestations (e.g., Root-knot nematodes) [115].
   * Insect Pests (e.g., Spider Mites, Aphids, Whiteflies, Thrips, Fungus Gnats) [32, 33, 113, 116]. Thrips and mites are common (Transcript P.80, P.179).
* Mechanism of Resistance: May involve structural defenses, production of defensive compounds (e.g., secondary metabolites like cannabinoids and terpenes can act as deterrents/protectants) [20, 21, 117], or activation of immune pathways. Plant polycultures may attract beneficial organisms for natural pest/disease control [118].
* Stress-Induced Susceptibility: Stress (abiotic or biotic) can weaken a plant's defenses and increase susceptibility to pests and diseases [34, 119]. Older mother plants may be more susceptible [34]. Stress can also cause HLVd to express symptoms in previously asymptomatic plants (Transcript P.17).
* Impact on Yield/Quality: Resistance (or lack thereof) directly impacts yield quantity and quality by minimizing (or maximizing) damage and systemic infection [32, 33, 113]. HLVd can devastate crops (Transcript P.3, P.16-17).




Comprehensive Simulation Parameters for Project Chimera
This document outlines potential parameters for the simulation mechanics of Project Chimera, drawing upon extensive research into Cannabis sativa L. biology, cultivation, genetics, and industry practices, significantly enhanced with details from cultivator discussions as recorded in "transcriptss.pdf" (hereafter cited as "Transcript P.[PageNumber]").
1. Cannabis Biology and Characteristics Parameters (Part 1: Botanical & Chemical)
This section details fundamental biological parameters of the Cannabis sativa L. plant, its morphology, chemistry, and inherent characteristics related to its interaction with the environment and biological threats.
1.1 Botanical Features Parameters
Parameters defining the physical structure, classification, and life cycle stages of the cannabis plant.
* Taxonomy and Classification:
   * Species: Cannabis sativa L. [1]
   * Subspecies/Varieties: sativa, indica, ruderalis.
      * Note: Traditional classifications may not correlate perfectly with genetic structure [2, 3]. Cultivator experience suggests that even within these, traits like stretch and nutrient preference can vary significantly (Transcript P.114, P.196). For example, some OG cuts have minimal lateral branching (Transcript P.182-183).
   * Hemp vs. Drug-type distinction: Based on THC content (e.g., <0.3% Δ⁹-THC for hemp) [1]. This is a critical botanical and regulatory parameter [1] (Transcript P.2, P.276-277).
      * Range: % Δ⁹-THC can range from negligible (<0.1%) in some hemp varieties to over 30% in high-potency drug-type cultivars [4-6]. Some cultivars test around 15-19% THC, while others can reach 28-35% THC (Transcript P.187, P.197). THCA flower is also a market factor under hemp regulations (Transcript P.276-279).
   * Chemovars: Classification based on cannabinoid profile [7, 8] (e.g., Type I: THC-dominant, Type II: THC/CBD mixed, Type III: CBD-dominant, Type IV: CBG-dominant, Type V: negligible cannabinoids) [2].
      * Game should support differentiation based on chemical profile rather than just traditional labels [2]. Consumer markets show preferences for different profiles; e.g., some European markets value specific terpene expressions over pure THC content (Transcript P.192).
* Morphology: Parameters defining the physical structure and form of the plant.
   * Plant Height: Potential range (e.g., 0.2m to >12m cultivated) [1]. Influenced by genetics and environment [1].
      * Hemp types tend to be taller and less branched, drug-types bushier [1, 9].
      * Range: Dwarf varieties can be 0.2m [1]. Fiber hemp can exceed 12m [1].
      * Drug types typically range from 0.5m to over 3m. Some strains can stretch significantly, e.g., a 12-inch plant stretching to 5 feet (Transcript P.114). Sherb Banger 22 known for a 4-week stretch period (Transcript P.114-115).
   * Stem Structure: Erect, furrows, branching patterns, woody interior, hollow internodes [1].
      * Stem diameter can range from 1-3cm in mature plants, influenced by genetics and vigor [13].
      * Base can become very big and thick [14].
      * Branching Pattern: Influenced by genetics and environment (e.g., apical dominant, lateral spread, balanced) [15]. Sativa-like strains tend to have more lateral branching. Some OG cuts show minimal lateral branching without topping (Transcript P.182-183). HLVd infection can cause abnormal, horizontal branching (Transcript P.80).
      * Sativas tend to have more lanky branches, Indicas more compact [16-18].
   * Leaf Morphology: Compound leaves with leaflets radiating from the petiole end [1].
      * Leaflet Number: Number of leaflets (e.g., 3-13) [1].
      * Developmental sequence: 1 (seedlings/stressed), 3, 5, 7, 9, then potentially more (up to 13+) on robust mature plants, decreasing later [19].
      * Leaflet Shape: Lanceolate, ovoid, oblanceolate [1]. Influenced by genetics (e.g., broad in Indica types, narrow in Sativa types) [19].
      * Serrated margins [1].
      * Leaf Size: Broad (Indica) vs. long/slender (Sativa) [19].
      * Changes throughout lifecycle, peaking around the 12th node [19].
      * Leaf Angle/Droop: Angle relative to stem, turgidity.
         * Heavily influenced by hydration (underwatered-drooping) [13, 20]. Genetics may influence baseline angle [13]. Hybrids show a spectrum [13]. HLVd may cause leaves to curl or appear malformed (Transcript P.80).
      * Diagnostic Leaf Venation [1].
   * Leaf Arrangement: Opposite (lower nodes) to alternate (main stem) [1, 19].
      * Phyllotaxy shift typically occurs around the 12th node [19].
   * Bud/Flower Structure: Shape (e.g., conical, spear, round, "golf balls" (Transcript P.181), foxtail), density (airy, medium, compact, "rock-hard" under LEDs (Transcript P.202)), leaf-to-calyx ratio [15].
      * Indica types tend to have dense, compact buds, Sativa types longer, airy buds [11, 16].
      * Foxtailing can occur, sometimes accelerating towards harvest [21]. Some strains exhibit foxtailing as a genetic trait, not necessarily negative (Transcript P.120).
      * HLVd can cause "dudding" or significantly reduced bud development and trichome production (Transcript P.80, P.171).
   * Pistil Color (Mature): Colors such as orange-red, pink-purple, brown [15].
   * Trichome Density: Potential levels (low, medium, high) [15].
      * A key visual quality indicator (frostiness, resin) [15, 22, 23]. Influenced by genetics and environment [15, 24, 25]. Some strains are known for high resin production suitable for hash (Transcript P.9, P.21).
      * Can vary dramatically between strains [24]. Use of products like Athena Stack can visually increase trichome production (Transcript P.160).
   * Trichome Appearance: Transition in color (clear to milky to brown/amber) indicates maturity [15, 22, 26].
      * Visual cues for resin and ripeness [15, 22, 26]. Trichomes contain cannabinoids [24]. For hash production, plants might be harvested earlier when trichomes are optimal for separation (e.g., day 40 for a 70-day flower strain) (Transcript P.197).
   * Trichome Degradation: Can be induced by experiments [27]. Poor storage can lead to reduced trichome vibrancy [28, 29]. Improper drying/curing can lead to terpene loss (Transcript P.179).
   * Root System: Adaptable taproot with lateral branching [1].
      * Can reach up to 2.5m deep in soil depending on soil/water [1, 30].
      * Root health and development influenced by growing media [30, 31]. HLVd can be present in roots (Transcript P.83). Fusarium also infects through roots (Transcript P.84).
      * Plants from seed have a strong, deep taproot; cloned plants typically have weaker, more lateral, not as deep roots [32].
      * Rootbound plants stress plant if left untreated [33].
      * Root restriction (small containers) stunts growth, limits nutrient/water uptake, alters structure [30, 34, 35]. Smaller pots (e.g., 1-2 gallons) preferred by some for more control with frequent irrigations (Transcript P.127).
   * Visual Representation: Potential for root system visualization showing medium, water, nutrient response [36].
   * Fruit (Achene)/Seed: <3.8mm length, often in persistent perianth (mottled/marbled) [1]. Seed production can yield 5,000 to over 20,000 seeds per light depending on cultivation methods and nutrient lines (Transcript P.309). Shipping seeds is generally legal (DEA rescheduled, Transcript P.2), but banking for seed sales can be problematic (Transcript P.2). Cuttings/clones shipping legality is evolving, based on <0.3% THC in the cutting itself (Transcript P.1-2, P.276-277).
* Sex Determination:
   * Predominantly dioecious (separate male (XY)/female (XX) plants) [1, 37]. Females are valued for cannabinoids in inflorescences [37].
   * Monoecious/Hermaphroditic forms: Can occur naturally (stress-induced, e.g., light leaks, temperature swings (Transcript P.158, P.171)) or be chemically induced (e.g., silver thiosulfate, STS (Transcript P.169)) for breeding [37].
      * Hermaphroditism involves producing both male and female flowers on the same plant, leading to "seeded" crops [38, 39]. Some strains have a higher genetic predisposition to herm under stress (e.g., Dante's Inferno #6) (Transcript P.152). Sterility of pollen from hermaphroditic plants can vary (Transcript P.152).
* Growth Stages:
   * Germination: First physiological stage [40].
      * Requires proper medium temperature (8-10°C average daily minimum for outdoor sowing, or specific ranges for in vitro/controlled) [41, 42].
      * Light not required [42]. Influenced by genetics, physical factors (medium composition, env conditions) [40].
      * Optimal conditions and quality seeds yield 80-100% germination [43]. Poor germination rates can be associated with bad genetics [44] or old seeds (Transcript P.168).
      * Range/Likely Level: Germination rate can be affected by genotype, medium composition, and environmental conditions [40, 43]. Reputable breeders aim for near 100% [43].
   * Seedling: Early growth [45, 46].
      * Typically single leaflet leaves initially, progressing to 3, then 5 [19]. Sensitive stage [47].
   * Vegetative: Rapid growth stage, building root system and stems, then foliage [46, 48].
      * Needs high nitrogen [46, 49]. Fairly tough during this stage [50]. Environmental conditions like temp/humidity deviations impact growth speed [51]. Optimal VPD is crucial (Transcript P.235). Low light (e.g. 200s PPFD) can be sufficient if DLI is met (Transcript P.161). Veg duration varies (e.g., 10-18 days for some commercial setups (Transcript P.176, P.217), up to 5-6 weeks for others (Transcript P.200)).
      * Problems often begin to show here [52]. Duration modeled as 50 days in one facility example [53].
   * Flowering: Stage where inflorescences develop [45, 46].
      * Requires lower humidity (especially late flower, e.g. 40-50% RH, though some run higher at 60-65% with LEDs (Transcript P.161)) and specific light spectrum/intensity [47]. Needs higher phosphorus/potassium [45, 49]. Light cycle typically 12/12, but some manipulate to 11/13 to finish plants or influence expression (Transcript P.115).
      * Longest stage in one model (57 days) [53]. Can range from 7 weeks (e.g., Rainbow Belts, Zkittlez crosses (Transcript P.115)) to 10+ weeks (e.g., Haze varieties, some OGs (Transcript P.115, P.169, P.308)) depending on genetics. Stretch period (first 1-4 weeks of flower) can last 3-4 weeks for some strains (e.g., Sherb Banger 22 (Transcript P.114-115)).
   * Maturation: Buds thicken, trichomes mature [21, 27].
      * Harvest timing determined by trichome appearance (clear to milky to amber) and yield/chemistry correlation [54]. Cannabinoid and terpene profiles change during maturation (Transcript P.8, P.172). Some harvest earlier for specific products like hash (Transcript P.197).
   * Harvest: Physical removal of plants/flowers [55]. Timing crucial for potency/quality [54, 56].
* Phenotypic Plasticity: The ability of a plant with a specific genotype to exhibit different phenotypes in different environments [38, 57-60].
   * This is a fundamental concept for GxE modeling [38, 57-60]. Environment (light, temp, nutrients, stress) heavily influences expression of genetic potential (Transcript P.187, P.200-207).
   * Clones with identical genotype can show different phenotypes with varied conditions [3, 58].
1.2 Chemical Profile Parameters
Parameters defining the chemical composition of the cannabis plant, particularly secondary metabolites produced primarily in glandular trichomes [4, 24, 61].
* Cannabinoids: (>140 identified) [62].
   * Major Cannabinoids:
      * Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC): Psychoactive compound [63].
         * Potency often measured as % DW [64]. Levels up to 25-30% of floral dry weight achieved [4]. Some cultivars testing at 28-35% THC reported (Transcript P.187). Others may test lower (e.g. 12-19%) but still be desirable (Transcript P.170, P.197). Moisture content at testing significantly impacts reported THC % (Transcript P.12, P.22).
         * Can reach 30% in some plants [5].
         * Likely Levels: High THC strains can exceed 20%, some even reaching 30% [4-6]. Cultivator discussions mention THC levels from 12% to 35%+ (Transcript P.13, P.170, P.187, P.197).
         * Traditional hemp is <0.3% [1]. THCA flower market exists under hemp definition (Transcript P.276-279).
      * Cannabidiol (CBD): Non-psychoactive, therapeutic potential [63, 65].
         * Potency often measured as % DW [64].
         * Likely Levels: High CBD strains can exceed 15-20%. Many hybrids have mixed ratios.
      * Cannabigerol (CBG): Precursor to other cannabinoids [63]. Increasing interest in breeding [66].
      * Cannabinol (CBN): Sedative effects [63]. Accumulates with degradation/aging [63].
   * Minor Cannabinoids: Growing interest (distinct therapeutic benefits) [66].
      * Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV): Investigating production genetics crucial [66].
      * Cannabidivarin (CBDV): Investigating production genetics crucial [66].
      * Cannabichromene (CBC): Investigating production genetics crucial [66].
      * Cannabichromenevarin (CBCV) [63].
      * Cannabigerovarin (CBGV) [63].
      * Delta-8 THC [63], Delta-10 THC [63], HHC [63]: Novel cannabinoids often in legal grey areas, facing evolving scrutiny [67]. Delta-8 can be synthesized from CBD (Transcript P.279-281).
      * THCP, THCB [63].
   * Cannabinoid Acids: Biosynthetic precursors, convert to neutral form via decarboxylation (heat, aging) [63, 68, 69].
      * THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) [63]. THCA flower being sold under hemp regulations is a major market factor (Transcript P.276-279).
      * CBDA (cannabidiolic acid) [63].
      * CBGA (cannabigerolic acid) [63].
   * Total Cannabinoids (e.g., Total THC: THCA * 0.877 + THC, Total CBD: CBDA * 0.877 + CBD) [63].
      * Critical quality parameters [68]. Content variability in plant material is an issue for consistency [68].
      * Can reach 25-30% of floral dry weight [4]. Potency is a key driver in many markets, though this is being questioned by connoisseurs (Transcript P.170, P.197, P.239). Moisture content at testing significantly impacts reported THC % (Transcript P.12, P.22). Using products like "Fade" can increase THC by 2-6% absolute (Transcript P.13).
* Terpenes: (>120 identified) [62].
   * Aromatic compounds contributing to aroma, flavor, and potential effects (entourage effect) [63, 65, 70]. Produced in glandular trichomes [61]. Critical for consumer preference, especially in connoisseur markets (Transcript P.8, P.152, P.179, P.192).
   * Concentration influenced by genetics, environment, post-harvest handling [71]. Late-stage nutrient protocols (like "Fade") can enhance terpene expression (Transcript P.8-9). Drying and curing are critical for terpene preservation (Transcript P.179, P.298-299).
   * Dominant Terpenes: Myrcene, Limonene, Caryophyllene, Pinene, Ocimene, Terpinolene [63].
   * Other Terpenes: Humulene, Linalool, Bisabolol, Nerolidol, Geraniol, Borneol, Fenchol, Cineole, Camphor, Phellandrene, Terpineol, Carene, Farnesene, Phytol, Carvacrol, Aromadendrene, Eudesmol [63].
   * Terpene Profiles: Concentrations and ratios of individual terpenes [64, 65, 71]. Contributes to market demand [71]. Breeding for unique terpene profiles is a major goal for some (Transcript P.152, P.172).
   * System for classification (e.g., Cream/Cake/Cookies/Candy, Fruity, Herbal, Pine, Skunk, Spicy, Sweet, Tropical, Woody/Earth) [72]. The "candy" profile (e.g., from Dante's Inferno #6) is currently popular (Transcript P.152, P.172). "Gas" is another popular profile (Transcript P.187).
   * Total Terpenes [63]. High terpene content is desirable but can be diluted by excessive yield focus ("yield dilution") (Transcript P.62).
   * Volatilization: Terpenes can volatilize, especially during drying/curing at warmer temperatures [73].
      * Proper drying/curing crucial for retention [25, 54, 73]. Target 7-10 days dry time, 60F/60%RH environment (Transcript P.298-299).
* Flavonoids: Contribute to pigmentation and aroma/flavor [8, 63].
   * Cannflavins [63]. Anthocyanins responsible for purple colors, influenced by genetics and cold temperatures (Transcript P.14-15).
* Volatile Sulfur Compounds (VSCs): Contribute to pungent/characteristic notes like "gas" or "skunk" [63]. Unstable over time [63].
* Esters: Contribute sweet/fruity notes [63].
* Other Constituents: Hydrocarbons, phenolics, sugars [63].
* Entourage Effect: Synergistic interaction between cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds influencing effects and therapeutic potential [8, 63].
1.3 Physiological Processes Parameters (Continuation)
Parameters governing the internal functions and responses of the cannabis plant, building on the initial photosynthesis, transpiration, nutrient uptake, and biosynthesis parameters.
* Water Relations: Beyond basic transpiration.
   * Water Uptake Rate: Influenced by root system size/health, substrate moisture content, substrate type (e.g., coir's high water retention vs. rockwool's quick dry down) [1-3]. VPD heavily influences uptake (Transcript P.125, P.235).
   * Aquaporin activity (e.g., PIP aquaporins) may play a role at a molecular level [2].
   * Leaf Water Potential: Measure of plant water stress. Influenced by substrate moisture, humidity, airflow, transpiration rate.
   * Stomatal Response: Opening and closing of stomata to regulate gas exchange and water loss.
      * Influenced by light intensity, CO2 levels, humidity, wind. Can be reduced in later maturation stages [4]. Far-red light at end of day can influence stomatal closure and plant sleep cycles (Transcript P.203).
* Carbon Metabolism:
   * Carbon Fixation Rate: Directly related to photosynthetic rate.
   * Photoassimilate Production: Synthesis of sugars.
   * Photoassimilate Partitioning: Allocation of sugars to different plant parts (roots, shoots, leaves, flowers).
      * Influenced by growth stage, nutrient availability (e.g., Nitrogen for vegetative growth vs. Phosphorus for flowering/bud development) [5]. Late flower N restriction (e.g., using "Fade") encourages resource allocation to flowers (Transcript P.7-9, P.15).
* Hormonal Regulation: Internal plant hormones (phytohormones) play crucial roles in growth, development, and responses to environment and stress.
   * Auxins: Involved in root development, apical dominance, vegetative growth. Auxin activity typically decreases during flowering transition [6].
   * Cytokinins: Promote cell division, shoot development. Certain cytokinins increase during flowering transition [6].
      * Meta-topolin (mT), a natural cytokinin, is effective for shoot proliferation in tissue culture [7].
   * Gibberellins: Involved in stem elongation (e.g., "stretch" at flowering onset) [6].
   * Abscisic Acid (ABA): Stress hormone, involved in stomatal closure and dormancy. Increases under drought stress. Drought stress (generative steering) is a key crop steering technique (Transcript P.122-123).
   * Ethylene: Involved in senescence, ripening, stress responses.
   * Brassinosteroids: Promote growth and stress tolerance.
   * Phytohormone Balance: The relative levels and interactions of these hormones regulate developmental transitions (e.g., vegetative to flowering, re-vegetation) [6, 8].
      * Mother plants in long-term vegetative state may experience subtle changes in hormonal balance [4].
* Nutrient Mobility and Translocation: Movement of absorbed nutrients within the plant (e.g., from older leaves to new growth/flowers).
   * Efficiency may diminish with physiological age [4]. Nitrogen is highly mobile and translocated from fan leaves during late flower if root zone N is restricted (e.g. when using "Fade") (Transcript P.8, P.15). Calcium is immobile; deficiencies (e.g., from flushing with straight RO water or pulling Core too early) can lead to issues like bud rot (Transcript P.7-8, P.12).
* Resource Remobilization: Breakdown of macromolecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids) in senescing tissues and transport of resulting nutrients to other parts of the plant [9].
   * Occurs in older leaves even in vegetative mothers [4]. Crucial for reproductive success in nature [9]. This is a key mechanism during "Fade" or flushing (Transcript P.8, P.15).
* Developmental Plasticity: Ability to alter growth patterns in response to environmental cues (e.g., branching patterns influenced by light distribution, nutrient availability) [10].
* Circadian Rhythms: Internal biological clock regulating daily physiological processes (e.g., photosynthesis, transpiration, flowering time). Interacts with photoperiod. Use of far-red light to signal end-of-day can influence these rhythms (Transcript P.203).
1.4 Stress Responses Parameters
Parameters defining how the cannabis plant reacts to and is affected by various abiotic and biotic stressors, and its ability to tolerate them. Stress can impact yield, quality, and even chemotype. Strategic stress (e.g., controlled drought, specific nutrient withdrawal like "Fade") can enhance desired traits like terpene and cannabinoid production (Transcript P.8, P.122-124).
* Abiotic Stress Responses: Responses to non-living environmental factors.
   * Drought Stress: (Intentional for generative steering)
      * Physiological Effects: Reduced stomatal conductance, decreased photosynthesis, wilting, reduced transpiration.
      * Can induce changes in leaf water potential [11]. Induces hormonal responses for survival and reproduction (Transcript P.122).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced biomass, lower flower yield.
      * Controlled drought stress in flowering stage can increase inflorescence dry weight and cannabinoid content [12]. Key part of "generative steering" by manipulating drybacks (Transcript P.11, P.122-123).
      * Chemotype Effects: May increase cannabinoid/terpene concentration (due to reduced biomass/water content or stress-induced synthesis) or decrease total production (due to reduced metabolic activity) [11, 13]. (Transcript P.8, P.124).
      * Stress-induced synthesis vs. dilution [13].
   * Heat Stress:
      * Physiological Effects: Denaturation of enzymes, impaired photosynthesis, increased respiration, heat shock protein production.
      * Can cause managing temperature to be critical for quality [14]. Excessive heat can stress plants, leading to reduced quality or hermaphroditism (Transcript P.158, P.171).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced flower development, wilting, leaf damage.
      * Chemotype Effects: Can degrade cannabinoids (e.g., THC) and volatilize terpenes, reducing overall potency and aroma profile [14].
   * Cold Stress:
      * Physiological Effects: Reduced enzymatic activity, membrane damage, impaired nutrient uptake.
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, leaf damage, reduced yield.
      * Chemotype Effects: Can impact cannabinoid/terpene synthesis.
      * Some varieties may show color changes (e.g., purple hues) in response to cold [15]. This is a common technique to enhance "bag appeal" (Transcript P.14-15). Colder water at end of flower can also induce color (Transcript P.14).
   * Light Stress (Too High/Low Intensity):
      * Physiological Effects: Photoinhibition (damage to photosynthetic apparatus) from excessive light [16].
      * Reduced photosynthesis from insufficient light. Plants growing into lights will burn (Transcript P.114).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Leaf burn, stunted growth, reduced yield from excessive light.
      * Leggy growth, low yield from insufficient light.
      * Chemotype Effects: Optimal light intensity and spectrum are crucial for cannabinoid and terpene production [17-19]. Some genetics are more sensitive to high PPFD than others (e.g., old Indicas) (Transcript P.116).
      * UV light can stimulate cannabinoid production (protective mechanism) [20, 21], but excessive UV can be damaging.
      * Different light spectra affect morphological, physiological, and chemical parameters [17, 22]. Far-red can influence flowering time and stretch (Transcript P.203). Mixed HPS/LED can give unique expressions (Transcript P.202-207).
   * Nutrient Deficiency/Toxicity:
      * Physiological Effects: Impaired metabolic processes, reduced photosynthesis, visible symptoms (e.g., leaf yellowing from N deficiency, brown spots from P deficiency/toxicity, leaf burn from nutrient excess/toxicity) [23, 24]. Calcium deficiency in late flower can lead to bud rot (Transcript P.7-8).
      * Can trigger/accelerate senescence [25]. Removing core nutrients (e.g., Athena ProLine Core) too early or using straight RO water can cause deficiencies (Transcript P.8, P.12).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced biomass, lower yield [5, 23, 24].
      * Nutrient imbalance can restrict development [26]. Overwatering can lead to nutrient lockout or root issues mistaken for deficiencies (Transcript P.11).
      * Chemotype Effects: Nutrient availability significantly impacts cannabinoid and terpene biosynthesis and concentration [18, 27, 28].
      * High Nitrogen can decrease cannabinoid/terpene concentration while increasing biomass (dilution effect) [5, 29]. This is a reason for products like "Fade" (Transcript P.7-9).
      * Phosphorus is conventionally supplied at high amounts for optimal function and yield, but deficiency at vegetative stage impacts functional phenotyping and ionome [30].
   * Waterlogged Soil/Root Zone Hypoxia:
      * Physiological Effects: Root damage, impaired nutrient/water uptake, reduced oxygen availability to roots. Increased risk with overwatering, especially in dense media like coco if not managed (Transcript P.11, P.126).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Wilting, stunted growth, root rot susceptibility [31], reduced yield.
      * Chemotype Effects: Reduced plant health negatively impacts secondary metabolite production.
   * Salinity Stress: Accumulation of soluble salts in the root zone, particularly in hydroponics/soilless media [26]. High EC in media due to insufficient runoff or excessive drybacks (Transcript P.123, P.158).
      * Physiological Effects: Impaired water uptake, ion toxicity.
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced yield. Lockout of other nutrients.
      * Chemotype Effects: Can impact metabolite profiles. Extreme EC can burn plants.
* Biotic Stress Responses: Responses to living organisms.
   * Pest Infestation: (See also 1.6 Pest/Disease Resistance Parameters)
      * Damage Types: Feeding damage (leaf loss, tissue damage), disease transmission, growth hindrance [32, 33]. Thrips, mites mentioned as common problems (Transcript P.80, P.179).
      * Physiological Effects: Allocation of resources to defense mechanisms (e.g., production of defensive compounds).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Reduced vigor, stunted growth, significant yield loss [32, 33].
      * Trichome damage/loss can directly reduce cannabinoid/terpene yield [34].
   * Pathogen Infection: (See also 1.6 Pest/Disease Resistance Parameters)
      * Damage Types: Tissue damage, impaired physiological function (e.g., nutrient/water transport, photosynthesis), systemic infection [32, 35]. Bud rot (Botrytis) is a major concern, linked to calcium deficiency and high humidity (Transcript P.7-8, P.15). Fusarium is a root pathogen, no cure, spreads via water (Transcript P.84). HLVd causes stunting, dudding, reduced quality (Transcript P.3, P.16, P.80, P.171).
      * Physiological Effects: Activation of plant immune response, production of defense compounds.
      * Older mothers may have potentially weakened immune response or chronic stress leading to higher susceptibility [34].
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Reduced vigor, stunted growth, wilting, necrosis, significant yield loss [32, 35]. HLVd can devastate crops (Transcript P.3, P.16-17).
      * Can be mistaken for age-related decline [34]. Systemic pathogens like HLVd cause stunting and reduced trichome production/yields [34].
   * Competition (Light, Nutrients, Water, Space): Competition from other cannabis plants or companion plants [36].
      * Physiological Effects: Altered growth patterns (e.g., reaching for light), reduced resource uptake efficiency.
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Reduced individual plant yield. Plant spacing is important for maximizing yield per area [37, 38]. Density of 1.6 plants/sq ft mentioned (Transcript P.183).
   * Stress-Induced Senescence: Premature aging and death of plant tissues or the whole plant due to severe or prolonged stress [9]. Can be desirable at end of flower (e.g., with "Fade") but problematic if premature (Transcript P.8).
1.5 Strain-Specific Optimal Conditions and Characteristics Parameters
Parameters defining the variations in optimal growth conditions, growth habits, and other characteristics between different cannabis genotypes (strains/cultivars). Cultivars show wide variation in response to environment and inputs (Transcript P.114, P.163, P.187, P.200).
* Optimal Environmental Ranges: Genotype-dependent ideal ranges for:
   * Temperature: Specific optimal temperature ranges for vegetative and flowering stages [39]. Some strains are more sensitive to temperature swings (Transcript P.15, P.158). Some growers run 73-76F even in late flower with "Fade" (Transcript P.15).
   * Humidity: Specific optimal humidity ranges for vegetative and flowering stages [39]. Some strains are more prone to mold in high humidity (Transcript P.15). Some run 60-65% RH with LEDs in flower (Transcript P.161).
   * Light Intensity (PPFD): Different strains may utilize light more or less efficiently and have different saturation points. Some strains are sensitive to high PPFD (e.g. old indicas) (Transcript P.116).
   * Light Spectrum: Different strains may respond differently to specific light wavelengths [17, 22, 39]. Some strains show better color or terpene expression under specific spectra (e.g. mixed HPS/LED, or specific LED spectra like ThinkGrow vs. Luxx) (Transcript P.202-207, P.113, P.160). Far-red for end-of-day signal (Transcript P.203).
   * CO2 Concentration: Optimal CO2 levels for different strains, especially in CEA [39-41]. Typically 1500ppm in flower (Transcript P.161).
   * Airflow/Ventilation: Specific needs for different growth structures and densities to prevent mold/pests [42]. Dense bud structures require more airflow (Transcript P.15).
   * Substrate Moisture Content: Optimal levels and tolerance for drying out or waterlogging vary [1-3]. Some strains prefer larger drybacks than others (Transcript P.11, P.124). Rockwool vs. Coco drydown characteristics (Transcript P.113, P.180).
   * Nutrient Solution pH: Optimal pH range for nutrient uptake can vary slightly by strain and substrate [16, 43, 44]. Some growers maintain a consistent pH (e.g. 6.0-6.2) for all strains in coco (Transcript P.158). Monosilicic acid can affect pH in rockwool (Transcript P.11).
   * Nutrient Concentrations (EC/PPM): Optimal nutrient strength varies by strain and growth stage [27, 43, 45]. Some strains are heavy feeders, others sensitive (e.g., OGs might prefer lower EC than Runtz; Runtz sensitive to high EC, Pie Hoe can take very high EC) (Transcript P.196). Some run 3.0 EC all the way through with Athena ProLine (Transcript P.12, P.15).
   * Specific Nutrient Ratios (NPK, Ca:Mg, etc.): Optimal ratios can be strain-specific and outcome-specific (e.g., maximizing yield vs. maximizing cannabinoid concentration) [13, 27, 45].
* Growth Habits and Morphology: Genotype-dependent traits:
   * Plant Height and Structure: Tall/thin (sativa-like) vs. short/bushy (indica-like) [10, 47, 48]. Some strains have significant stretch (e.g. Sherb Banger 22, 4-week stretch from 12" to 5ft (Transcript P.114-115)) while others are short (e.g. Rainbow Belts, Zkittlez finishing in 7 weeks (Transcript P.115)).
   * Branching patterns (apical dominant vs. lateral spread, OG minimal lateral without topping) [10] (Transcript P.182-183). Untopped plants develop a main cola with lateral branches reaching near the top (Transcript P.183).
   * Internodal spacing [49].
   * Leaf Morphology: Leaflet number and width (narrow-leaf vs. broad-leaf) [49, 50].
   * Flower Structure: Shape, density, leaf-to-calyx ratio [10, 51]. Some genetics known for specific structures (e.g. "golf balls" (Transcript P.181)). Some LED-grown flower can be rock-hard (Transcript P.202).
   * Root System Development: Efficiency and structure of the root system can be strain-specific [3]. Cloned plants have weaker, more lateral roots than seed plants (Transcript P.32).
* Life Cycle and Flowering Time: Genotype-dependent duration of growth stages:
   * Seedling Stage Duration [10, 54].
   * Vegetative Stage Duration: Ability to remain vegetative under specific photoperiods [10, 55, 56]. Commercial grows may have veg times from 10-18 days (Transcript P.176, P.217) to several weeks (Transcript P.200).
   * Flowering Time/Duration: Crucial parameter for breeding and cultivation planning [10, 39, 57, 58]. Ranges from 7 weeks (e.g. some Zkittlez crosses (Transcript P.115)) to 10+ weeks (e.g. Haze varieties, some OGs (Transcript P.115, P.169, P.308)).
   * Sativa varieties typically have longer flowering times (10-16 weeks) than indica (6-10 weeks) [10, 57]. Photoperiod-dependent flowering vs. autoflowering [59-61]. Use of far-red light can shorten flowering time by a week or more (Transcript P.204).
   * Semi-full-term/fast-flowering strains [62, 63].
   * Maturation Indicators: Visual cues (pistil color, trichome appearance) indicating peak ripeness can vary slightly by strain [10, 64-66].
   * Trichome gland head phenotypes change over the flowering period [67]. Optimal harvest timing varies by strain [68]. For hash production, plants might be harvested earlier (e.g. day 40 for a 70-day flower strain) (Transcript P.197).
   * Re-vegetation Potential: Ability to revert to vegetative growth after flowering can be strain-dependent [6, 69].
   * Older plants may struggle more [69].
* Yield Potential: Genotype-dependent inherent capacity for biomass and flower production under optimal conditions.
   * Measured in grams per plant or grams per square foot [65]. Can be influenced by substrate choice [1, 3]. Yields of 2.5-4 lbs per light reported by cultivators (Transcript P.116, P.204). Some strains are known low yielders (e.g. cookies, lcg) but high value (Transcript P.116, P.241). Under canopy lighting can increase yield by 20-50% (Transcript P.225). Hash yields also vary (e.g., 3% vs 4-5.5% with Fade) (Transcript P.9).
* Chemical Profile (Chemovar): Genotype-dependent production of specific cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds, defining the chemovar [70-73]. Huge driver of market value (Transcript P.152, P.170).
   * Major Cannabinoid Ratios (THC:CBD, THC:CBG, CBD:CBG, etc.) [28, 74].
   * Controlled by alleles at cannabinoid synthase loci [74, 75]. Breeding can target specific ratios [76, 77].
   * Minor Cannabinoid Production (THCV, CBDV, CBG, CBC, CBN, etc.) [72, 78, 79]. Genetics control production [76, 77].
   * Terpene Profile: Specific terpenes produced and their relative concentrations [72, 73, 78, 80, 81]. Unique terpene profiles are highly sought after (e.g. Dante's Inferno #6 cherry candy (Transcript P.152, P.172)).
   * Genetics are foundational, but expression influenced by environment and post-harvest [82]. Terpene synthase (TPS) genes are involved [45, 79].
   * Unique flavor/aroma profiles are strain-defining [58, 80, 83]. "Gas" and "candy" profiles are popular (Transcript P.172, P.187).
   * Flavonoid Production (Cannflavins, Anthocyanins for color) [78, 84] (Transcript P.14-15).
   * Total Cannabinoid Potency (% DW) [71, 74, 78]. THC levels are often a primary market driver, but this is shifting (Transcript P.170, P.197, P.239).
   * Total Terpene Content [78].
   * Stability of Chemical Profile: Consistency across different grows/environments (less plastic chemotypes) [85, 86].
   * Desirable for medicinal/commercial purposes [18, 71, 85, 87]. Influenced by genetic stability and environmental control [71, 88].
* Propagation Characteristics:
   * Seed Germination Rate and Speed [10, 89, 90]. Old seeds may have poor germination (Transcript P.168).
   * Cloning Success Rate: Ease of rooting cuttings, influenced by genetics and mother plant health [25, 91]. Some strains are notoriously difficult to clone.
   * Tissue Culture Recalcitrance: Difficulty of in vitro regeneration and transformation for certain genotypes [48, 92, 93].
   * Genotype-dependent HLVd eradication success in meristem culture [94]. (Transcript P.17-18, P.81).
   * Doubled Haploid (DH) Production Recalcitrance: Difficulty in generating homozygous lines rapidly [41, 93].
* Responses to Cultivation Techniques: Different strains may respond better or worse to specific methods.
   * Pruning and Training (e.g., Topping, LST, ScrOG, SOG): Effectiveness for yield and structure optimization can be strain-dependent [91, 95-98]. Some growers prefer no topping to encourage a dominant main cola and specific canopy structures (Transcript P.182-183). Stretch characteristics heavily influence training needs (Transcript P.114). Defoliation timing and extent interact with nutrient strategies like "Fade" (Transcript P.12, P.15-16).
   * Fertigation/Nutrient Management: Optimal nutrient timing, strength, and ratios may differ [13, 26, 27, 43, 45]. Some strains (e.g. Runtz) are sensitive to high EC, while others (e.g. Pie Hoe) can take very high EC (Transcript P.196). OGs might prefer lower EC (Transcript P.196).
   * Nutrient Use Efficiency (NUE) varies [45, 99].
   * Substrate Suitability: Performance can vary significantly across different substrates (soil, coco coir, peat mixes, rockwool, hydroponics) and may be genotype-specific [2, 3, 31]. Some strains might prefer the buffering of coco over the rapid changes in rockwool (Transcript P.116, P.180).
* Desired Effects/Applications: While influenced by environment and post-harvest, the genetic chemotype provides the basis for different effects and applications [72, 86, 100-103].
   * Recreational Effects: Energetic/cerebral (sativa-like) vs. relaxing/sedative (indica-like) [47, 102].
   * While traditional Sativa/Indica labels are not fully reliable for genetic structure [59, 104, 105], market categorizations persist based on perceived effects [47, 102].
   * Entourage effect plays a role [78, 106-109].
   * Medical Applications: Specific cannabinoid/terpene profiles are sought for therapeutic outcomes (e.g., high CBD for certain conditions) [85, 101, 110].
   * Tailored chemotypes for medicinal needs [111].
1.6 Pest/Disease Resistance Parameters
Parameters defining a strain's inherent ability to resist common pests and diseases.
* Resistance Levels: Genotype-dependent inherent resistance or susceptibility to:
   * Fungal Diseases (e.g., Powdery Mildew (PM), Bud Rots like Botrytis, Root/Crown Rots like Fusarium/Pythium) [32, 33, 112, 113]. Botrytis is a significant issue, especially with dense buds or under LED lights if humidity is not managed. Calcium deficiency can exacerbate botrytis (Transcript P.7-8, P.15). Fusarium is a concern in hydroponic/recirculating systems, no cure, spreads via water (Transcript P.84). PM resistance is a highly desirable trait (Transcript P.79).
   * Mold resistance is a crucial agronomic trait [114]. Strains from humid regions may have higher mold resistance [58].
   * Bacterial Diseases [32, 33].
   * Viral Pathogens (e.g., Hop Latent Viroid - HLVd) [32, 33]. HLVd resistance varies by genotype [94]. Some strains may be asymptomatic carriers (Transcript P.80-81). Symptoms include stunting, dudding, brittle stems, abnormal branching, reduced trichomes/yield/quality (Transcript P.3, P.16, P.80, P.171). Spreads via mechanical damage (tools, hands) (Transcript P.80). Present in roots (Transcript P.83). Can be in seeds (unconfirmed for cannabis, Tumi studying) (Transcript P.17, P.81).
   * Nematode Infestations (e.g., Root-knot nematodes) [115].
   * Insect Pests (e.g., Spider Mites, Aphids, Whiteflies, Thrips, Fungus Gnats) [32, 33, 113, 116]. Thrips and mites are common (Transcript P.80, P.179).
* Mechanism of Resistance: May involve structural defenses, production of defensive compounds (e.g., secondary metabolites like cannabinoids and terpenes can act as deterrents/protectants) [20, 21, 117], or activation of immune pathways. Plant polycultures may attract beneficial organisms for natural pest/disease control [118].
* Stress-Induced Susceptibility: Stress (abiotic or biotic) can weaken a plant's defenses and increase susceptibility to pests and diseases [34, 119]. Older mother plants may be more susceptible [34]. Stress can also cause HLVd to express symptoms in previously asymptomatic plants (Transcript P.17).
* Impact on Yield/Quality: Resistance (or lack thereof) directly impacts yield quantity and quality by minimizing (or maximizing) damage and systemic infection [32, 33, 113]. HLVd can devastate crops (Transcript P.3, P.16-17).
2. Cannabis Breeding and Genetics Parameters
This section outlines the parameters governing the inheritance of traits, breeding methodologies, genetic management, and related analytical and simulation considerations within the Cannabis sativa L. breeding context. This is a core area for the simulation, driving strain development and player progression. Breeding for specific terpene profiles (e.g., "candy," "gas") and unique genetic expressions is a primary goal (Transcript P.152, P.172, P.187). The philosophy of finding "keepers" through pheno hunting is central (Transcript P.150, P.154).
2.1 Foundational Genetic Parameters
Parameters defining the basic mechanisms of inheritance and genome structure in cannabis.
* 2.1.1 Genome Structure
   * Ploidy Level: Diploid (2n=20) [1, 2]. Simulation models diploid genetics as default.
   * Chromosome Number: 9 pairs of autosomes and XY sex chromosomes [1, 2].
   * Genome Size: Approximately 818 Mb (XX) to 843 Mb (XY) [1]. Influences data for genomic analysis. Cannabis genome still being fully mapped (Transcript P.78).
   * Chloroplast Genome: Parameter for maternal lineage or plastid traits (e.g., Yunma 7 approx. 153,899 bp) [3].
   * Mitochondrial Genome: Parameter for specific research paths, less critical for core breeding [4].
* 2.1.2 Inheritance Models
   * Mendelian Inheritance: For traits controlled by single genes with dominant/recessive or co-dominant alleles [5-8].
      * Alleles: Different forms of a gene.
      * Genotype: The genetic makeup (e.g., BB, Bb, bb).
      * Phenotype: Observable characteristics from genotype and environment (e.g., Silver Bud vs. Golden Bud) [1].
      * Homozygous: Two identical alleles (e.g., BB, bb) [2, 3].
      * Heterozygous: Two different alleles (e.g., Bb) [4].
      * Dominance: One allele masks another's effect [5, 19].
      * Recessiveness: The masked allele [5].
      * Co-dominance: Both alleles contribute to the phenotype [6].
   * Polygenic Inheritance: For traits controlled by multiple genes (e.g., yield, potency, flowering time, disease resistance) [6, 7, 9-11].
      * Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs): Genomic regions influencing quantitative traits [6, 8-10, 12-17]. Simulation models cumulative effect.
      * Additive Gene Action/Effects: Multiple genes contribute cumulatively [8, 21].
      * Dominance Effects: Interactions between alleles at the same locus [8].
      * Epistasis: Interactions between genes at different loci influencing expression [6, 8-10, 18-20]. Crucial for complex traits.
   * Pleiotropy: A single gene/QTL affecting multiple traits [6, 9, 10, 18].
   * Gene Linkage: Genes close on the same chromosome are often inherited together [6, 8, 10].
      * Recombination/Crossing Over: Process shuffling genetic material; frequency depends on gene distance [8-10, 21, 22].
      * Genetic Maps: Represent gene order based on recombination frequency [8, 22].
      * Recombination Rate: Frequency of crossing over, influenced by genetic map distances (cM) [21, 22].
   * Mutation Rate: Spontaneous DNA sequence change introducing new variation [21, 23, 24]. Parameter for novel trait appearance.
* 2.1.3 Genetic Variation and Population Genetics
   * Genetic Variation: Differences in DNA among individuals.
   * Allele Frequency: Proportion of a specific allele in a population.
   * Genetic Diversity: Total genetic characteristics in a species; maintaining it is a challenge [7, 11].
   * Genetic Erosion: Loss of genetic diversity [11].
   * Gene Flow: Transfer of genetic variation between populations [7].
* 2.1.4 Sex Determination
   * XY System: Male (XY), Female (XX) as primary mechanism [1, 25, 26].
   * Environmental Influence on Sex Expression: Conditions like light leaks, temperature swings can lead to hermaphroditism [26] (Transcript P.158, P.171).
   * Genetic Influence on Sex Expression: Genes on sex chromosomes and autosomes [27]. Sex identification markers (PCR-based) used in reality [28-30]. Some strains have higher genetic predisposition to herm (e.g., Dante's Inferno #6, Transcript P.152).
   * Chemically Induced Reversal: Using agents like Silver Thiosulfate (STS) or colloidal silver to induce male flowers on female plants for feminized seed production (Transcript P.169). Pollen viability/sterility from induced males can vary (Transcript P.152).
* 2.1.5 Genotype-by-Environment Interaction (GxE)
   * The effect of an environmental factor on phenotypic expression depends on the genotype [6, 7, 10, 12-14]. Critical for realism. (Transcript P.113, P.116, P.160-161, P.187, P.196, P.200-207).
   * Norm of Reaction: Range of phenotypes from one genotype across different environments.
   * Different strains perform differently under varying conditions (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor, different nutrient regimes, light spectra - HPS vs LED, specific LED brands like ThinkGrow vs Luxx, under canopy lighting) [15, 16] (Transcript P.113, P.116, P.160-161, P.202-207, P.225).

   * Phenotypic Selection: Based on observable traits [5, 7, 17-20, 127, 145, 173-176]. Critical in pheno hunts.
   * Genotypic Selection: Based on genetic information (e.g., from DNA fingerprinting or marker analysis).
   * Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS): Using genetic markers linked to traits [7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 21, 22, 131, 198, 203, 225-227]. (e.g., for HLVd resistance, PM resistance genes, Transcript P.79).

   * Optimal Contribution Selection: Maximize genetic gain, minimize inbreeding [7].
   * Male Selection: Crucial. Structure, vigor, stem rubs for aroma, and ultimately, progeny testing (performance of offspring) are key (Symbiotic, Transcript P.170-171).
* 2.3.2 Mating Designs and Sexual Reproduction
   * Generations: Tracking P, F1, F2, F3+ [132, 151-155]. F1s for diversity, later generations for stabilization (Transcript P.168, P.188, P.319).
   * Manual Pollination: Player identifies plants, collects/applies pollen [5, 23, 135-137, 145, 146]. Shaking males in a room with females (Symbiotic, Transcript P.170).
      * Pollen Collection Rate: Amount of viable pollen [137]. Some reversed females produce little or delayed pollen (Transcript P.169-170).
      * Pollination Success Rate: Probability of seed set [47, 147].

   * Tissue Culture/Micropropagation: Advanced sterile lab technique [6, 33, 43, 50-52, 56, 59, 64, 66, 138, 165, 169-171].
      * Protocol Success Rate: For initiation, multiplication, rooting, acclimatization [56, 69, 138]. Genotype-dependent [33, 56, 67, 69].
      * Pathogen Eradication (Meristem Culture): [33, 50, 51, 56, 59, 67, 138]. Especially for HLVd (Transcript P.17-18, P.81). Success varies by genotype and lab skill. Can take multiple attempts (Transcript P.17-18).
      * Regeneration Capability: From explants (nodal segments, callus, protoplasts) [64, 67, 68, 138]. Protoplast regeneration is a bottleneck [68].
      * Genetic Stability: Assessed with markers (e.g., ISSR) [138, 163, 165]. Generally stable.
      * Equipment and Sterile Technique: Required (Laminar flow hood, autoclave, microscope) [169, 170, 172] (Transcript P.18-19). Cost can be $5k-$50k for a lab (Transcript P.18-20).
      * Benefits: Cleaning genetics, long-term storage/archiving of genetic libraries, rapid multiplication (Transcript P.17-22).
* 2.3.4 Population Development and Breeding Strategies/Schemes
   * Selective Breeding (Phenotype Selection): [5, 127, 145, 173-176]. Traditional, slower [173]. Still the primary method in pheno hunts (Transcript P.150-155).
   * Crossbreeding & Hybridization: Creating hybrids from distinct parents [6, 20, 135, 147, 173, 176, 177]. Creates new combinations, hybrid vigor [6, 20, 173]. (e.g., Symbiotic crossing Purple Punch male with various elite females, Transcript P.167).
   * Population Types:
      * F1 Hybrid: First generation from distinct parents [5, 11, 19, 25, 30-32, 136, 152, 155, 183, 186, 187]. Often exhibit heterosis. Uniform if parents stable. High diversity for pheno hunting (Transcript P.168, P.188).
      * F2 Population: From selfing/intercrossing F1s; segregation occurs [4, 5]. Can reveal recessive traits.
      * Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs): From repeated selfing of F2 individuals [7]. For mapping/gene interaction studies.
      * Backcross Populations (BC1, BC2, etc.): [4, 24, 25, 29]. Used to introgress specific traits (Transcript P.319-320, TH Seeds explanation).
      * Synthetic Varieties: Intercrossing parental lines, random mating [7].
      * Diversity Panels: For association mapping [128].
   * Developing True-Breeding Lines (Inbred Lines - IBLs): Mating related individuals for homozygosity/stability [2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19, 20, 24-27, 30, 31, 34, 136, 151, 153, 178-182]. Breed true [2-4, 29, 151, 180, 182]. Requires many generations [2]. Working lines to F4/F5 for stability (TH Seeds, Transcript P.320).
      * Inbreeding: Essential for stable lines [9, 10].
      * Inbreeding Depression: Reduced vigor/fertility from deleterious recessives [6, 144, 178, 183, 184].
      * Managing Inbreeding: Population size, new genetics, nucleus breeding [144, 178, 185].
   * Backcrossing (BX): Crossing hybrid to recurrent parent to transfer specific trait [4, 6, 7, 18, 24-29, 136, 151, 152, 178, 181, 183, 188, 189]. Percentage of recurrent parent genome increases each generation [183, 189]. Used to reinforce traits of a mother plant using new male offspring (TH Seeds, Transcript P.319-320).
   * Self-Pollination (Selfing, S1): Crossing plant with itself [6, 18, 190, 191]. Increases homozygosity. Induced chemically [1, 25, 41]. Used to create S1s of elite cuts (e.g., Tear Gas S1, Transcript P.188) for preservation or finding similar phenos.
   * Stabilization: Reducing genetic variation for consistent trait expression [2, 11, 19, 20, 24-27, 30, 31, 34]. Goal of many breeding programs.
   * Phenotype Hunting (Pheno Hunting): Growing populations (e.g., 100s-1000s of seeds) to identify desirable individuals [6, 11, 35, 202, 204, 205]. (MHigh Dave 400 seeds, Transcript P.154; Highline 5k-10k seeds/year, Transcript P.238). Requires meticulous observation and record keeping. Taking cuts of all plants before flower is a common SOP (Transcript P.154).
   * Seed Production Methods:
      * Seeds: Generative propagation, introduces variation unless stable lines [23, 31, 36-41].
      * Feminized Seeds: Using induced female pollen (from STS/colloidal silver treatment (Transcript P.169)) on females for all-female offspring [25, 31, 41, 192]. Risk of hermaphroditism if unstable genetics [148, 192, 193]. European market demand is high (Transcript P.170). Some reversed females are poor pollen producers or pollen is delayed (Transcript P.169-170).
      * Autoflowering Genetics: Breeding with C. ruderalis [53-57].
      * Triploid Seeds: Crossing tetraploid (4x) with diploid (2x) for sterile triploid (3x) offspring [11, 150, 194, 195]. Prevents seeding. May have distinct morphology/aromas, not necessarily higher potency [196]. More variation if parents not homozygous [197]. (Post-MVP)
      * Developing Semi-Full-Term Varieties (Quicks): Crossing autoflowering and photoperiod parents [44].
   * Doubled Haploids (DHs): Homozygous lines in one generation from haploid cells [18, 33, 138, 139]. Accelerates breeding.
* 2.3.5 Breeding Program Management
   * Breeding Goals/Objectives: Defining desired traits (e.g., unique terps, yield, disease resistance, market trends like "candy" or "gas") [198-201] (Transcript P.151-152, P.172, P.187).
   * Record Keeping: Pedigree, phenotype, genotype, stock inventory [121, 152, 207]. Crucial for tracking selections.
   * Data Collection: Meticulous recording of observations during pheno hunts [45, 121, 134, 202, 206].
   * Selection Intensity: Proportion of individuals selected (e.g., finding 9 keepers from 231 seeds - Coffin Candy hunt, Transcript P.305).
   * Breeding Cycle/Generation Time: [18, 208, 209]. From seed to tested selection can take a year or more (MHigh Dave, Transcript P.154). Seed production itself is 3-4 months plus testing (Symbiotic, Transcript P.168).
   * Resource Constraints: Space (veg space for holding cuts during pheno hunt is critical, Transcript P.186), labor, budget [64, 65, 202, 208, 232, 244]. Pheno hunts are expensive (MHigh Dave $10k-$15k on seeds, Transcript P.150, P.154).
   * Testing: Sending selections to multiple testers in varied environments for feedback before release (TH Seeds, Transcript P.320).

Potential for targeted trait modification (e.g., PM resistance, Transcript P.79) [16, 84, 230]. Requires efficient transformation/regeneration [224]. Subject to regulations [16, 50, 65].
   * Genetic Transformation (Introducing foreign DNA): [6, 16, 64, 138].
   * Somatic Hybridization (Protoplast Fusion): Fusing cells to create hybrid [68, 138, 139]. Regeneration is a bottleneck [68].

Comprehensive Simulation Parameters for Project Chimera
This document outlines potential parameters for the simulation mechanics of Project Chimera, drawing upon extensive research into Cannabis sativa L. biology, cultivation, genetics, and industry practices, significantly enhanced with details from cultivator discussions as recorded in "transcriptss.pdf" (hereafter cited as "Transcript P.[PageNumber]").
1. Cannabis Biology and Characteristics Parameters (Part 1: Botanical & Chemical)
This section details fundamental biological parameters of the Cannabis sativa L. plant, its morphology, chemistry, and inherent characteristics related to its interaction with the environment and biological threats.
1.1 Botanical Features Parameters
Parameters defining the physical structure, classification, and life cycle stages of the cannabis plant.
* Taxonomy and Classification:
   * Species: Cannabis sativa L. [1]
   * Subspecies/Varieties: sativa, indica, ruderalis.
      * Note: Traditional classifications may not correlate perfectly with genetic structure [2, 3]. Cultivator experience suggests that even within these, traits like stretch and nutrient preference can vary significantly (Transcript P.114, P.196). For example, some OG cuts have minimal lateral branching (Transcript P.182-183).
   * Hemp vs. Drug-type distinction: Based on THC content (e.g., <0.3% Δ⁹-THC for hemp) [1]. This is a critical botanical and regulatory parameter [1] (Transcript P.2, P.276-277).
      * Range: % Δ⁹-THC can range from negligible (<0.1%) in some hemp varieties to over 30% in high-potency drug-type cultivars [4-6]. Some cultivars test around 15-19% THC, while others can reach 28-35% THC (Transcript P.187, P.197). THCA flower is also a market factor under hemp regulations (Transcript P.276-279).
   * Chemovars: Classification based on cannabinoid profile [7, 8] (e.g., Type I: THC-dominant, Type II: THC/CBD mixed, Type III: CBD-dominant, Type IV: CBG-dominant, Type V: negligible cannabinoids) [2].
      * Game should support differentiation based on chemical profile rather than just traditional labels [2]. Consumer markets show preferences for different profiles; e.g., some European markets value specific terpene expressions over pure THC content (Transcript P.192).
* Morphology: Parameters defining the physical structure and form of the plant.
   * Plant Height: Potential range (e.g., 0.2m to >12m cultivated) [1]. Influenced by genetics and environment [1].
      * Hemp types tend to be taller and less branched, drug-types bushier [1, 9].
      * Range: Dwarf varieties can be 0.2m [1]. Fiber hemp can exceed 12m [1].
      * Drug types typically range from 0.5m to over 3m. Some strains can stretch significantly, e.g., a 12-inch plant stretching to 5 feet (Transcript P.114). Sherb Banger 22 known for a 4-week stretch period (Transcript P.114-115).
   * Stem Structure: Erect, furrows, branching patterns, woody interior, hollow internodes [1].
      * Stem diameter can range from 1-3cm in mature plants, influenced by genetics and vigor [13].
      * Base can become very big and thick [14].
      * Branching Pattern: Influenced by genetics and environment (e.g., apical dominant, lateral spread, balanced) [15]. Sativa-like strains tend to have more lateral branching. Some OG cuts show minimal lateral branching without topping (Transcript P.182-183). HLVd infection can cause abnormal, horizontal branching (Transcript P.80).
      * Sativas tend to have more lanky branches, Indicas more compact [16-18].
   * Leaf Morphology: Compound leaves with leaflets radiating from the petiole end [1].
      * Leaflet Number: Number of leaflets (e.g., 3-13) [1].
      * Developmental sequence: 1 (seedlings/stressed), 3, 5, 7, 9, then potentially more (up to 13+) on robust mature plants, decreasing later [19].
      * Leaflet Shape: Lanceolate, ovoid, oblanceolate [1]. Influenced by genetics (e.g., broad in Indica types, narrow in Sativa types) [19].
      * Serrated margins [1].
      * Leaf Size: Broad (Indica) vs. long/slender (Sativa) [19].
      * Changes throughout lifecycle, peaking around the 12th node [19].
      * Leaf Angle/Droop: Angle relative to stem, turgidity.
         * Heavily influenced by hydration (underwatered-drooping) [13, 20]. Genetics may influence baseline angle [13]. Hybrids show a spectrum [13]. HLVd may cause leaves to curl or appear malformed (Transcript P.80).
      * Diagnostic Leaf Venation [1].
   * Leaf Arrangement: Opposite (lower nodes) to alternate (main stem) [1, 19].
      * Phyllotaxy shift typically occurs around the 12th node [19].
   * Bud/Flower Structure: Shape (e.g., conical, spear, round, "golf balls" (Transcript P.181), foxtail), density (airy, medium, compact, "rock-hard" under LEDs (Transcript P.202)), leaf-to-calyx ratio [15].
      * Indica types tend to have dense, compact buds, Sativa types longer, airy buds [11, 16].
      * Foxtailing can occur, sometimes accelerating towards harvest [21]. Some strains exhibit foxtailing as a genetic trait, not necessarily negative (Transcript P.120).
      * HLVd can cause "dudding" or significantly reduced bud development and trichome production (Transcript P.80, P.171).
   * Pistil Color (Mature): Colors such as orange-red, pink-purple, brown [15].
   * Trichome Density: Potential levels (low, medium, high) [15].
      * A key visual quality indicator (frostiness, resin) [15, 22, 23]. Influenced by genetics and environment [15, 24, 25]. Some strains are known for high resin production suitable for hash (Transcript P.9, P.21).
      * Can vary dramatically between strains [24]. Use of products like Athena Stack can visually increase trichome production (Transcript P.160).
   * Trichome Appearance: Transition in color (clear to milky to brown/amber) indicates maturity [15, 22, 26].
      * Visual cues for resin and ripeness [15, 22, 26]. Trichomes contain cannabinoids [24]. For hash production, plants might be harvested earlier when trichomes are optimal for separation (e.g., day 40 for a 70-day flower strain) (Transcript P.197).
   * Trichome Degradation: Can be induced by experiments [27]. Poor storage can lead to reduced trichome vibrancy [28, 29]. Improper drying/curing can lead to terpene loss (Transcript P.179).
   * Root System: Adaptable taproot with lateral branching [1].
      * Can reach up to 2.5m deep in soil depending on soil/water [1, 30].
      * Root health and development influenced by growing media [30, 31]. HLVd can be present in roots (Transcript P.83). Fusarium also infects through roots (Transcript P.84).
      * Plants from seed have a strong, deep taproot; cloned plants typically have weaker, more lateral, not as deep roots [32].
      * Rootbound plants stress plant if left untreated [33].
      * Root restriction (small containers) stunts growth, limits nutrient/water uptake, alters structure [30, 34, 35]. Smaller pots (e.g., 1-2 gallons) preferred by some for more control with frequent irrigations (Transcript P.127).
   * Visual Representation: Potential for root system visualization showing medium, water, nutrient response [36].
   * Fruit (Achene)/Seed: <3.8mm length, often in persistent perianth (mottled/marbled) [1]. Seed production can yield 5,000 to over 20,000 seeds per light depending on cultivation methods and nutrient lines (Transcript P.309). Shipping seeds is generally legal (DEA rescheduled, Transcript P.2), but banking for seed sales can be problematic (Transcript P.2). Cuttings/clones shipping legality is evolving, based on <0.3% THC in the cutting itself (Transcript P.1-2, P.276-277).
* Sex Determination:
   * Predominantly dioecious (separate male (XY)/female (XX) plants) [1, 37]. Females are valued for cannabinoids in inflorescences [37].
   * Monoecious/Hermaphroditic forms: Can occur naturally (stress-induced, e.g., light leaks, temperature swings (Transcript P.158, P.171)) or be chemically induced (e.g., silver thiosulfate, STS (Transcript P.169)) for breeding [37].
      * Hermaphroditism involves producing both male and female flowers on the same plant, leading to "seeded" crops [38, 39]. Some strains have a higher genetic predisposition to herm under stress (e.g., Dante's Inferno #6) (Transcript P.152). Sterility of pollen from hermaphroditic plants can vary (Transcript P.152).
* Growth Stages:
   * Germination: First physiological stage [40].
      * Requires proper medium temperature (8-10°C average daily minimum for outdoor sowing, or specific ranges for in vitro/controlled) [41, 42].
      * Light not required [42]. Influenced by genetics, physical factors (medium composition, env conditions) [40].
      * Optimal conditions and quality seeds yield 80-100% germination [43]. Poor germination rates can be associated with bad genetics [44] or old seeds (Transcript P.168).
      * Range/Likely Level: Germination rate can be affected by genotype, medium composition, and environmental conditions [40, 43]. Reputable breeders aim for near 100% [43].
   * Seedling: Early growth [45, 46].
      * Typically single leaflet leaves initially, progressing to 3, then 5 [19]. Sensitive stage [47].
   * Vegetative: Rapid growth stage, building root system and stems, then foliage [46, 48].
      * Needs high nitrogen [46, 49]. Fairly tough during this stage [50]. Environmental conditions like temp/humidity deviations impact growth speed [51]. Optimal VPD is crucial (Transcript P.235). Low light (e.g. 200s PPFD) can be sufficient if DLI is met (Transcript P.161). Veg duration varies (e.g., 10-18 days for some commercial setups (Transcript P.176, P.217), up to 5-6 weeks for others (Transcript P.200)).
      * Problems often begin to show here [52]. Duration modeled as 50 days in one facility example [53].
   * Flowering: Stage where inflorescences develop [45, 46].
      * Requires lower humidity (especially late flower, e.g. 40-50% RH, though some run higher at 60-65% with LEDs (Transcript P.161)) and specific light spectrum/intensity [47]. Needs higher phosphorus/potassium [45, 49]. Light cycle typically 12/12, but some manipulate to 11/13 to finish plants or influence expression (Transcript P.115).
      * Longest stage in one model (57 days) [53]. Can range from 7 weeks (e.g., Rainbow Belts, Zkittlez crosses (Transcript P.115)) to 10+ weeks (e.g., Haze varieties, some OGs (Transcript P.115, P.169, P.308)) depending on genetics. Stretch period (first 1-4 weeks of flower) can last 3-4 weeks for some strains (e.g., Sherb Banger 22 (Transcript P.114-115)).
   * Maturation: Buds thicken, trichomes mature [21, 27].
      * Harvest timing determined by trichome appearance (clear to milky to amber) and yield/chemistry correlation [54]. Cannabinoid and terpene profiles change during maturation (Transcript P.8, P.172). Some harvest earlier for specific products like hash (Transcript P.197).
   * Harvest: Physical removal of plants/flowers [55]. Timing crucial for potency/quality [54, 56].
* Phenotypic Plasticity: The ability of a plant with a specific genotype to exhibit different phenotypes in different environments [38, 57-60].
   * This is a fundamental concept for GxE modeling [38, 57-60]. Environment (light, temp, nutrients, stress) heavily influences expression of genetic potential (Transcript P.187, P.200-207).
   * Clones with identical genotype can show different phenotypes with varied conditions [3, 58].
1.2 Chemical Profile Parameters
Parameters defining the chemical composition of the cannabis plant, particularly secondary metabolites produced primarily in glandular trichomes [4, 24, 61].
* Cannabinoids: (>140 identified) [62].
   * Major Cannabinoids:
      * Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC): Psychoactive compound [63].
         * Potency often measured as % DW [64]. Levels up to 25-30% of floral dry weight achieved [4]. Some cultivars testing at 28-35% THC reported (Transcript P.187). Others may test lower (e.g. 12-19%) but still be desirable (Transcript P.170, P.197). Moisture content at testing significantly impacts reported THC % (Transcript P.12, P.22).
         * Can reach 30% in some plants [5].
         * Likely Levels: High THC strains can exceed 20%, some even reaching 30% [4-6]. Cultivator discussions mention THC levels from 12% to 35%+ (Transcript P.13, P.170, P.187, P.197).
         * Traditional hemp is <0.3% [1]. THCA flower market exists under hemp definition (Transcript P.276-279).
      * Cannabidiol (CBD): Non-psychoactive, therapeutic potential [63, 65].
         * Potency often measured as % DW [64].
         * Likely Levels: High CBD strains can exceed 15-20%. Many hybrids have mixed ratios.
      * Cannabigerol (CBG): Precursor to other cannabinoids [63]. Increasing interest in breeding [66].
      * Cannabinol (CBN): Sedative effects [63]. Accumulates with degradation/aging [63].
   * Minor Cannabinoids: Growing interest (distinct therapeutic benefits) [66].
      * Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV): Investigating production genetics crucial [66].
      * Cannabidivarin (CBDV): Investigating production genetics crucial [66].
      * Cannabichromene (CBC): Investigating production genetics crucial [66].
      * Cannabichromenevarin (CBCV) [63].
      * Cannabigerovarin (CBGV) [63].
      * Delta-8 THC [63], Delta-10 THC [63], HHC [63]: Novel cannabinoids often in legal grey areas, facing evolving scrutiny [67]. Delta-8 can be synthesized from CBD (Transcript P.279-281).
      * THCP, THCB [63].
   * Cannabinoid Acids: Biosynthetic precursors, convert to neutral form via decarboxylation (heat, aging) [63, 68, 69].
      * THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) [63]. THCA flower being sold under hemp regulations is a major market factor (Transcript P.276-279).
      * CBDA (cannabidiolic acid) [63].
      * CBGA (cannabigerolic acid) [63].
   * Total Cannabinoids (e.g., Total THC: THCA * 0.877 + THC, Total CBD: CBDA * 0.877 + CBD) [63].
      * Critical quality parameters [68]. Content variability in plant material is an issue for consistency [68].
      * Can reach 25-30% of floral dry weight [4]. Potency is a key driver in many markets, though this is being questioned by connoisseurs (Transcript P.170, P.197, P.239). Moisture content at testing significantly impacts reported THC % (Transcript P.12, P.22). Using products like "Fade" can increase THC by 2-6% absolute (Transcript P.13).
* Terpenes: (>120 identified) [62].
   * Aromatic compounds contributing to aroma, flavor, and potential effects (entourage effect) [63, 65, 70]. Produced in glandular trichomes [61]. Critical for consumer preference, especially in connoisseur markets (Transcript P.8, P.152, P.179, P.192).
   * Concentration influenced by genetics, environment, post-harvest handling [71]. Late-stage nutrient protocols (like "Fade") can enhance terpene expression (Transcript P.8-9). Drying and curing are critical for terpene preservation (Transcript P.179, P.298-299).
   * Dominant Terpenes: Myrcene, Limonene, Caryophyllene, Pinene, Ocimene, Terpinolene [63].
   * Other Terpenes: Humulene, Linalool, Bisabolol, Nerolidol, Geraniol, Borneol, Fenchol, Cineole, Camphor, Phellandrene, Terpineol, Carene, Farnesene, Phytol, Carvacrol, Aromadendrene, Eudesmol [63].
   * Terpene Profiles: Concentrations and ratios of individual terpenes [64, 65, 71]. Contributes to market demand [71]. Breeding for unique terpene profiles is a major goal for some (Transcript P.152, P.172).
   * System for classification (e.g., Cream/Cake/Cookies/Candy, Fruity, Herbal, Pine, Skunk, Spicy, Sweet, Tropical, Woody/Earth) [72]. The "candy" profile (e.g., from Dante's Inferno #6) is currently popular (Transcript P.152, P.172). "Gas" is another popular profile (Transcript P.187).
   * Total Terpenes [63]. High terpene content is desirable but can be diluted by excessive yield focus ("yield dilution") (Transcript P.62).
   * Volatilization: Terpenes can volatilize, especially during drying/curing at warmer temperatures [73].
      * Proper drying/curing crucial for retention [25, 54, 73]. Target 7-10 days dry time, 60F/60%RH environment (Transcript P.298-299).
* Flavonoids: Contribute to pigmentation and aroma/flavor [8, 63].
   * Cannflavins [63]. Anthocyanins responsible for purple colors, influenced by genetics and cold temperatures (Transcript P.14-15).
* Volatile Sulfur Compounds (VSCs): Contribute to pungent/characteristic notes like "gas" or "skunk" [63]. Unstable over time [63].
* Esters: Contribute sweet/fruity notes [63].
* Other Constituents: Hydrocarbons, phenolics, sugars [63].
* Entourage Effect: Synergistic interaction between cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds influencing effects and therapeutic potential [8, 63].
1.3 Physiological Processes Parameters (Continuation)
Parameters governing the internal functions and responses of the cannabis plant, building on the initial photosynthesis, transpiration, nutrient uptake, and biosynthesis parameters.
* Water Relations: Beyond basic transpiration.
   * Water Uptake Rate: Influenced by root system size/health, substrate moisture content, substrate type (e.g., coir's high water retention vs. rockwool's quick dry down) [1-3]. VPD heavily influences uptake (Transcript P.125, P.235).
   * Aquaporin activity (e.g., PIP aquaporins) may play a role at a molecular level [2].
   * Leaf Water Potential: Measure of plant water stress. Influenced by substrate moisture, humidity, airflow, transpiration rate.
   * Stomatal Response: Opening and closing of stomata to regulate gas exchange and water loss.
      * Influenced by light intensity, CO2 levels, humidity, wind. Can be reduced in later maturation stages [4]. Far-red light at end of day can influence stomatal closure and plant sleep cycles (Transcript P.203).
* Carbon Metabolism:
   * Carbon Fixation Rate: Directly related to photosynthetic rate.
   * Photoassimilate Production: Synthesis of sugars.
   * Photoassimilate Partitioning: Allocation of sugars to different plant parts (roots, shoots, leaves, flowers).
      * Influenced by growth stage, nutrient availability (e.g., Nitrogen for vegetative growth vs. Phosphorus for flowering/bud development) [5]. Late flower N restriction (e.g., using "Fade") encourages resource allocation to flowers (Transcript P.7-9, P.15).
* Hormonal Regulation: Internal plant hormones (phytohormones) play crucial roles in growth, development, and responses to environment and stress.
   * Auxins: Involved in root development, apical dominance, vegetative growth. Auxin activity typically decreases during flowering transition [6].
   * Cytokinins: Promote cell division, shoot development. Certain cytokinins increase during flowering transition [6].
      * Meta-topolin (mT), a natural cytokinin, is effective for shoot proliferation in tissue culture [7].
   * Gibberellins: Involved in stem elongation (e.g., "stretch" at flowering onset) [6].
   * Abscisic Acid (ABA): Stress hormone, involved in stomatal closure and dormancy. Increases under drought stress. Drought stress (generative steering) is a key crop steering technique (Transcript P.122-123).
   * Ethylene: Involved in senescence, ripening, stress responses.
   * Brassinosteroids: Promote growth and stress tolerance.
   * Phytohormone Balance: The relative levels and interactions of these hormones regulate developmental transitions (e.g., vegetative to flowering, re-vegetation) [6, 8].
      * Mother plants in long-term vegetative state may experience subtle changes in hormonal balance [4].
* Nutrient Mobility and Translocation: Movement of absorbed nutrients within the plant (e.g., from older leaves to new growth/flowers).
   * Efficiency may diminish with physiological age [4]. Nitrogen is highly mobile and translocated from fan leaves during late flower if root zone N is restricted (e.g. when using "Fade") (Transcript P.8, P.15). Calcium is immobile; deficiencies (e.g., from flushing with straight RO water or pulling Core too early) can lead to issues like bud rot (Transcript P.7-8, P.12).
* Resource Remobilization: Breakdown of macromolecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids) in senescing tissues and transport of resulting nutrients to other parts of the plant [9].
   * Occurs in older leaves even in vegetative mothers [4]. Crucial for reproductive success in nature [9]. This is a key mechanism during "Fade" or flushing (Transcript P.8, P.15).
* Developmental Plasticity: Ability to alter growth patterns in response to environmental cues (e.g., branching patterns influenced by light distribution, nutrient availability) [10].
* Circadian Rhythms: Internal biological clock regulating daily physiological processes (e.g., photosynthesis, transpiration, flowering time). Interacts with photoperiod. Use of far-red light to signal end-of-day can influence these rhythms (Transcript P.203).
1.4 Stress Responses Parameters
Parameters defining how the cannabis plant reacts to and is affected by various abiotic and biotic stressors, and its ability to tolerate them. Stress can impact yield, quality, and even chemotype. Strategic stress (e.g., controlled drought, specific nutrient withdrawal like "Fade") can enhance desired traits like terpene and cannabinoid production (Transcript P.8, P.122-124).
* Abiotic Stress Responses: Responses to non-living environmental factors.
   * Drought Stress: (Intentional for generative steering)
      * Physiological Effects: Reduced stomatal conductance, decreased photosynthesis, wilting, reduced transpiration.
      * Can induce changes in leaf water potential [11]. Induces hormonal responses for survival and reproduction (Transcript P.122).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced biomass, lower flower yield.
      * Controlled drought stress in flowering stage can increase inflorescence dry weight and cannabinoid content [12]. Key part of "generative steering" by manipulating drybacks (Transcript P.11, P.122-123).
      * Chemotype Effects: May increase cannabinoid/terpene concentration (due to reduced biomass/water content or stress-induced synthesis) or decrease total production (due to reduced metabolic activity) [11, 13]. (Transcript P.8, P.124).
      * Stress-induced synthesis vs. dilution [13].
   * Heat Stress:
      * Physiological Effects: Denaturation of enzymes, impaired photosynthesis, increased respiration, heat shock protein production.
      * Can cause managing temperature to be critical for quality [14]. Excessive heat can stress plants, leading to reduced quality or hermaphroditism (Transcript P.158, P.171).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced flower development, wilting, leaf damage.
      * Chemotype Effects: Can degrade cannabinoids (e.g., THC) and volatilize terpenes, reducing overall potency and aroma profile [14].
   * Cold Stress:
      * Physiological Effects: Reduced enzymatic activity, membrane damage, impaired nutrient uptake.
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, leaf damage, reduced yield.
      * Chemotype Effects: Can impact cannabinoid/terpene synthesis.
      * Some varieties may show color changes (e.g., purple hues) in response to cold [15]. This is a common technique to enhance "bag appeal" (Transcript P.14-15). Colder water at end of flower can also induce color (Transcript P.14).
   * Light Stress (Too High/Low Intensity):
      * Physiological Effects: Photoinhibition (damage to photosynthetic apparatus) from excessive light [16].
      * Reduced photosynthesis from insufficient light. Plants growing into lights will burn (Transcript P.114).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Leaf burn, stunted growth, reduced yield from excessive light.
      * Leggy growth, low yield from insufficient light.
      * Chemotype Effects: Optimal light intensity and spectrum are crucial for cannabinoid and terpene production [17-19]. Some genetics are more sensitive to high PPFD than others (e.g., old Indicas) (Transcript P.116).
      * UV light can stimulate cannabinoid production (protective mechanism) [20, 21], but excessive UV can be damaging.
      * Different light spectra affect morphological, physiological, and chemical parameters [17, 22]. Far-red can influence flowering time and stretch (Transcript P.203). Mixed HPS/LED can give unique expressions (Transcript P.202-207).
   * Nutrient Deficiency/Toxicity:
      * Physiological Effects: Impaired metabolic processes, reduced photosynthesis, visible symptoms (e.g., leaf yellowing from N deficiency, brown spots from P deficiency/toxicity, leaf burn from nutrient excess/toxicity) [23, 24]. Calcium deficiency in late flower can lead to bud rot (Transcript P.7-8).
      * Can trigger/accelerate senescence [25]. Removing core nutrients (e.g., Athena ProLine Core) too early or using straight RO water can cause deficiencies (Transcript P.8, P.12).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced biomass, lower yield [5, 23, 24].
      * Nutrient imbalance can restrict development [26]. Overwatering can lead to nutrient lockout or root issues mistaken for deficiencies (Transcript P.11).
      * Chemotype Effects: Nutrient availability significantly impacts cannabinoid and terpene biosynthesis and concentration [18, 27, 28].
      * High Nitrogen can decrease cannabinoid/terpene concentration while increasing biomass (dilution effect) [5, 29]. This is a reason for products like "Fade" (Transcript P.7-9).
      * Phosphorus is conventionally supplied at high amounts for optimal function and yield, but deficiency at vegetative stage impacts functional phenotyping and ionome [30].
   * Waterlogged Soil/Root Zone Hypoxia:
      * Physiological Effects: Root damage, impaired nutrient/water uptake, reduced oxygen availability to roots. Increased risk with overwatering, especially in dense media like coco if not managed (Transcript P.11, P.126).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Wilting, stunted growth, root rot susceptibility [31], reduced yield.
      * Chemotype Effects: Reduced plant health negatively impacts secondary metabolite production.
   * Salinity Stress: Accumulation of soluble salts in the root zone, particularly in hydroponics/soilless media [26]. High EC in media due to insufficient runoff or excessive drybacks (Transcript P.123, P.158).
      * Physiological Effects: Impaired water uptake, ion toxicity.
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced yield. Lockout of other nutrients.
      * Chemotype Effects: Can impact metabolite profiles. Extreme EC can burn plants.
* Biotic Stress Responses: Responses to living organisms.
   * Pest Infestation: (See also 1.6 Pest/Disease Resistance Parameters)
      * Damage Types: Feeding damage (leaf loss, tissue damage), disease transmission, growth hindrance [32, 33]. Thrips, mites mentioned as common problems (Transcript P.80, P.179).
      * Physiological Effects: Allocation of resources to defense mechanisms (e.g., production of defensive compounds).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Reduced vigor, stunted growth, significant yield loss [32, 33].
      * Trichome damage/loss can directly reduce cannabinoid/terpene yield [34].
   * Pathogen Infection: (See also 1.6 Pest/Disease Resistance Parameters)
      * Damage Types: Tissue damage, impaired physiological function (e.g., nutrient/water transport, photosynthesis), systemic infection [32, 35]. Bud rot (Botrytis) is a major concern, linked to calcium deficiency and high humidity (Transcript P.7-8, P.15). Fusarium is a root pathogen, no cure, spreads via water (Transcript P.84). HLVd causes stunting, dudding, reduced quality (Transcript P.3, P.16, P.80, P.171).
      * Physiological Effects: Activation of plant immune response, production of defense compounds.
      * Older mothers may have potentially weakened immune response or chronic stress leading to higher susceptibility [34].
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Reduced vigor, stunted growth, wilting, necrosis, significant yield loss [32, 35]. HLVd can devastate crops (Transcript P.3, P.16-17).
      * Can be mistaken for age-related decline [34]. Systemic pathogens like HLVd cause stunting and reduced trichome production/yields [34].
   * Competition (Light, Nutrients, Water, Space): Competition from other cannabis plants or companion plants [36].
      * Physiological Effects: Altered growth patterns (e.g., reaching for light), reduced resource uptake efficiency.
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Reduced individual plant yield. Plant spacing is important for maximizing yield per area [37, 38]. Density of 1.6 plants/sq ft mentioned (Transcript P.183).
   * Stress-Induced Senescence: Premature aging and death of plant tissues or the whole plant due to severe or prolonged stress [9]. Can be desirable at end of flower (e.g., with "Fade") but problematic if premature (Transcript P.8).
1.5 Strain-Specific Optimal Conditions and Characteristics Parameters
Parameters defining the variations in optimal growth conditions, growth habits, and other characteristics between different cannabis genotypes (strains/cultivars). Cultivars show wide variation in response to environment and inputs (Transcript P.114, P.163, P.187, P.200).
* Optimal Environmental Ranges: Genotype-dependent ideal ranges for:
   * Temperature: Specific optimal temperature ranges for vegetative and flowering stages [39]. Some strains are more sensitive to temperature swings (Transcript P.15, P.158). Some growers run 73-76F even in late flower with "Fade" (Transcript P.15).
   * Humidity: Specific optimal humidity ranges for vegetative and flowering stages [39]. Some strains are more prone to mold in high humidity (Transcript P.15). Some run 60-65% RH with LEDs in flower (Transcript P.161).
   * Light Intensity (PPFD): Different strains may utilize light more or less efficiently and have different saturation points. Some strains are sensitive to high PPFD (e.g. old indicas) (Transcript P.116).
   * Light Spectrum: Different strains may respond differently to specific light wavelengths [17, 22, 39]. Some strains show better color or terpene expression under specific spectra (e.g. mixed HPS/LED, or specific LED spectra like ThinkGrow vs. Luxx) (Transcript P.202-207, P.113, P.160). Far-red for end-of-day signal (Transcript P.203).
   * CO2 Concentration: Optimal CO2 levels for different strains, especially in CEA [39-41]. Typically 1500ppm in flower (Transcript P.161).
   * Airflow/Ventilation: Specific needs for different growth structures and densities to prevent mold/pests [42]. Dense bud structures require more airflow (Transcript P.15).
   * Substrate Moisture Content: Optimal levels and tolerance for drying out or waterlogging vary [1-3]. Some strains prefer larger drybacks than others (Transcript P.11, P.124). Rockwool vs. Coco drydown characteristics (Transcript P.113, P.180).
   * Nutrient Solution pH: Optimal pH range for nutrient uptake can vary slightly by strain and substrate [16, 43, 44]. Some growers maintain a consistent pH (e.g. 6.0-6.2) for all strains in coco (Transcript P.158). Monosilicic acid can affect pH in rockwool (Transcript P.11).
   * Nutrient Concentrations (EC/PPM): Optimal nutrient strength varies by strain and growth stage [27, 43, 45]. Some strains are heavy feeders, others sensitive (e.g., OGs might prefer lower EC than Runtz; Runtz sensitive to high EC, Pie Hoe can take very high EC) (Transcript P.196). Some run 3.0 EC all the way through with Athena ProLine (Transcript P.12, P.15).
   * Specific Nutrient Ratios (NPK, Ca:Mg, etc.): Optimal ratios can be strain-specific and outcome-specific (e.g., maximizing yield vs. maximizing cannabinoid concentration) [13, 27, 45].
* Growth Habits and Morphology: Genotype-dependent traits:
   * Plant Height and Structure: Tall/thin (sativa-like) vs. short/bushy (indica-like) [10, 47, 48]. Some strains have significant stretch (e.g. Sherb Banger 22, 4-week stretch from 12" to 5ft (Transcript P.114-115)) while others are short (e.g. Rainbow Belts, Zkittlez finishing in 7 weeks (Transcript P.115)).
   * Branching patterns (apical dominant vs. lateral spread, OG minimal lateral without topping) [10] (Transcript P.182-183). Untopped plants develop a main cola with lateral branches reaching near the top (Transcript P.183).
   * Internodal spacing [49].
   * Leaf Morphology: Leaflet number and width (narrow-leaf vs. broad-leaf) [49, 50].
   * Flower Structure: Shape, density, leaf-to-calyx ratio [10, 51]. Some genetics known for specific structures (e.g. "golf balls" (Transcript P.181)). Some LED-grown flower can be rock-hard (Transcript P.202).
   * Root System Development: Efficiency and structure of the root system can be strain-specific [3]. Cloned plants have weaker, more lateral roots than seed plants (Transcript P.32).
* Life Cycle and Flowering Time: Genotype-dependent duration of growth stages:
   * Seedling Stage Duration [10, 54].
   * Vegetative Stage Duration: Ability to remain vegetative under specific photoperiods [10, 55, 56]. Commercial grows may have veg times from 10-18 days (Transcript P.176, P.217) to several weeks (Transcript P.200).
   * Flowering Time/Duration: Crucial parameter for breeding and cultivation planning [10, 39, 57, 58]. Ranges from 7 weeks (e.g. some Zkittlez crosses (Transcript P.115)) to 10+ weeks (e.g. Haze varieties, some OGs (Transcript P.115, P.169, P.308)).
   * Sativa varieties typically have longer flowering times (10-16 weeks) than indica (6-10 weeks) [10, 57]. Photoperiod-dependent flowering vs. autoflowering [59-61]. Use of far-red light can shorten flowering time by a week or more (Transcript P.204).
   * Semi-full-term/fast-flowering strains [62, 63].
   * Maturation Indicators: Visual cues (pistil color, trichome appearance) indicating peak ripeness can vary slightly by strain [10, 64-66].
   * Trichome gland head phenotypes change over the flowering period [67]. Optimal harvest timing varies by strain [68]. For hash production, plants might be harvested earlier (e.g. day 40 for a 70-day flower strain) (Transcript P.197).
   * Re-vegetation Potential: Ability to revert to vegetative growth after flowering can be strain-dependent [6, 69].
   * Older plants may struggle more [69].
* Yield Potential: Genotype-dependent inherent capacity for biomass and flower production under optimal conditions.
   * Measured in grams per plant or grams per square foot [65]. Can be influenced by substrate choice [1, 3]. Yields of 2.5-4 lbs per light reported by cultivators (Transcript P.116, P.204). Some strains are known low yielders (e.g. cookies, lcg) but high value (Transcript P.116, P.241). Under canopy lighting can increase yield by 20-50% (Transcript P.225). Hash yields also vary (e.g., 3% vs 4-5.5% with Fade) (Transcript P.9).
* Chemical Profile (Chemovar): Genotype-dependent production of specific cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds, defining the chemovar [70-73]. Huge driver of market value (Transcript P.152, P.170).
   * Major Cannabinoid Ratios (THC:CBD, THC:CBG, CBD:CBG, etc.) [28, 74].
   * Controlled by alleles at cannabinoid synthase loci [74, 75]. Breeding can target specific ratios [76, 77].
   * Minor Cannabinoid Production (THCV, CBDV, CBG, CBC, CBN, etc.) [72, 78, 79]. Genetics control production [76, 77].
   * Terpene Profile: Specific terpenes produced and their relative concentrations [72, 73, 78, 80, 81]. Unique terpene profiles are highly sought after (e.g. Dante's Inferno #6 cherry candy (Transcript P.152, P.172)).
   * Genetics are foundational, but expression influenced by environment and post-harvest [82]. Terpene synthase (TPS) genes are involved [45, 79].
   * Unique flavor/aroma profiles are strain-defining [58, 80, 83]. "Gas" and "candy" profiles are popular (Transcript P.172, P.187).
   * Flavonoid Production (Cannflavins, Anthocyanins for color) [78, 84] (Transcript P.14-15).
   * Total Cannabinoid Potency (% DW) [71, 74, 78]. THC levels are often a primary market driver, but this is shifting (Transcript P.170, P.197, P.239).
   * Total Terpene Content [78].
   * Stability of Chemical Profile: Consistency across different grows/environments (less plastic chemotypes) [85, 86].
   * Desirable for medicinal/commercial purposes [18, 71, 85, 87]. Influenced by genetic stability and environmental control [71, 88].
* Propagation Characteristics:
   * Seed Germination Rate and Speed [10, 89, 90]. Old seeds may have poor germination (Transcript P.168).
   * Cloning Success Rate: Ease of rooting cuttings, influenced by genetics and mother plant health [25, 91]. Some strains are notoriously difficult to clone.
   * Tissue Culture Recalcitrance: Difficulty of in vitro regeneration and transformation for certain genotypes [48, 92, 93].
   * Genotype-dependent HLVd eradication success in meristem culture [94]. (Transcript P.17-18, P.81).
   * Doubled Haploid (DH) Production Recalcitrance: Difficulty in generating homozygous lines rapidly [41, 93].
* Responses to Cultivation Techniques: Different strains may respond better or worse to specific methods.
   * Pruning and Training (e.g., Topping, LST, ScrOG, SOG): Effectiveness for yield and structure optimization can be strain-dependent [91, 95-98]. Some growers prefer no topping to encourage a dominant main cola and specific canopy structures (Transcript P.182-183). Stretch characteristics heavily influence training needs (Transcript P.114). Defoliation timing and extent interact with nutrient strategies like "Fade" (Transcript P.12, P.15-16).
   * Fertigation/Nutrient Management: Optimal nutrient timing, strength, and ratios may differ [13, 26, 27, 43, 45]. Some strains (e.g. Runtz) are sensitive to high EC, while others (e.g. Pie Hoe) can take very high EC (Transcript P.196). OGs might prefer lower EC (Transcript P.196).
   * Nutrient Use Efficiency (NUE) varies [45, 99].
   * Substrate Suitability: Performance can vary significantly across different substrates (soil, coco coir, peat mixes, rockwool, hydroponics) and may be genotype-specific [2, 3, 31]. Some strains might prefer the buffering of coco over the rapid changes in rockwool (Transcript P.116, P.180).
* Desired Effects/Applications: While influenced by environment and post-harvest, the genetic chemotype provides the basis for different effects and applications [72, 86, 100-103].
   * Recreational Effects: Energetic/cerebral (sativa-like) vs. relaxing/sedative (indica-like) [47, 102].
   * While traditional Sativa/Indica labels are not fully reliable for genetic structure [59, 104, 105], market categorizations persist based on perceived effects [47, 102].
   * Entourage effect plays a role [78, 106-109].
   * Medical Applications: Specific cannabinoid/terpene profiles are sought for therapeutic outcomes (e.g., high CBD for certain conditions) [85, 101, 110].
   * Tailored chemotypes for medicinal needs [111].
1.6 Pest/Disease Resistance Parameters
Parameters defining a strain's inherent ability to resist common pests and diseases.
* Resistance Levels: Genotype-dependent inherent resistance or susceptibility to:
   * Fungal Diseases (e.g., Powdery Mildew (PM), Bud Rots like Botrytis, Root/Crown Rots like Fusarium/Pythium) [32, 33, 112, 113]. Botrytis is a significant issue, especially with dense buds or under LED lights if humidity is not managed. Calcium deficiency can exacerbate botrytis (Transcript P.7-8, P.15). Fusarium is a concern in hydroponic/recirculating systems, no cure, spreads via water (Transcript P.84). PM resistance is a highly desirable trait (Transcript P.79).
   * Mold resistance is a crucial agronomic trait [114]. Strains from humid regions may have higher mold resistance [58].
   * Bacterial Diseases [32, 33].
   * Viral Pathogens (e.g., Hop Latent Viroid - HLVd) [32, 33]. HLVd resistance varies by genotype [94]. Some strains may be asymptomatic carriers (Transcript P.80-81). Symptoms include stunting, dudding, brittle stems, abnormal branching, reduced trichomes/yield/quality (Transcript P.3, P.16, P.80, P.171). Spreads via mechanical damage (tools, hands) (Transcript P.80). Present in roots (Transcript P.83). Can be in seeds (unconfirmed for cannabis, Tumi studying) (Transcript P.17, P.81).
   * Nematode Infestations (e.g., Root-knot nematodes) [115].
   * Insect Pests (e.g., Spider Mites, Aphids, Whiteflies, Thrips, Fungus Gnats) [32, 33, 113, 116]. Thrips and mites are common (Transcript P.80, P.179).
* Mechanism of Resistance: May involve structural defenses, production of defensive compounds (e.g., secondary metabolites like cannabinoids and terpenes can act as deterrents/protectants) [20, 21, 117], or activation of immune pathways. Plant polycultures may attract beneficial organisms for natural pest/disease control [118].
* Stress-Induced Susceptibility: Stress (abiotic or biotic) can weaken a plant's defenses and increase susceptibility to pests and diseases [34, 119]. Older mother plants may be more susceptible [34]. Stress can also cause HLVd to express symptoms in previously asymptomatic plants (Transcript P.17).
* Impact on Yield/Quality: Resistance (or lack thereof) directly impacts yield quantity and quality by minimizing (or maximizing) damage and systemic infection [32, 33, 113]. HLVd can devastate crops (Transcript P.3, P.16-17).
2. Cannabis Breeding and Genetics Parameters
This section outlines the parameters governing the inheritance of traits, breeding methodologies, genetic management, and related analytical and simulation considerations within the Cannabis sativa L. breeding context. This is a core area for the simulation, driving strain development and player progression. Breeding for specific terpene profiles (e.g., "candy," "gas") and unique genetic expressions is a primary goal (Transcript P.152, P.172, P.187). The philosophy of finding "keepers" through pheno hunting is central (Transcript P.150, P.154).

   * Genome Size: Approximately 818 Mb (XX) to 843 Mb (XY) [1]. Influences data for genomic analysis. Cannabis genome still being fully mapped (Transcript P.78).
   * Chloroplast Genome: Parameter for maternal lineage or plastid traits (e.g., Yunma 7 approx. 153,899 bp) [3].
   * Mitochondrial Genome: Parameter for specific research paths, less critical for core breeding [4].
* 2.1.2 Inheritance Models
   * Mendelian Inheritance: For traits controlled by single genes with dominant/recessive or co-dominant alleles [5-8].
      * Alleles: Different forms of a gene.
      * Genotype: The genetic makeup (e.g., BB, Bb, bb).
      * Phenotype: Observable characteristics from genotype and environment (e.g., Silver Bud vs. Golden Bud) [1].
      * Homozygous: Two identical alleles (e.g., BB, bb) [2, 3].
      * Heterozygous: Two different alleles (e.g., Bb) [4].
      * Dominance: One allele masks another's effect [5, 19].
      * Recessiveness: The masked allele [5].
      * Co-dominance: Both alleles contribute to the phenotype [6].
   * Polygenic Inheritance: For traits controlled by multiple genes (e.g., yield, potency, flowering time, disease resistance) [6, 7, 9-11].
      * Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs): Genomic regions influencing quantitative traits [6, 8-10, 12-17]. Simulation models cumulative effect.
      * Additive Gene Action/Effects: Multiple genes contribute cumulatively [8, 21].
      * Dominance Effects: Interactions between alleles at the same locus [8].
      * Epistasis: Interactions between genes at different loci influencing expression [6, 8-10, 18-20]. Crucial for complex traits.
   * Pleiotropy: A single gene/QTL affecting multiple traits [6, 9, 10, 18].
   * Gene Linkage: Genes close on the same chromosome are often inherited together [6, 8, 10].
      * Recombination/Crossing Over: Process shuffling genetic material; frequency depends on gene distance [8-10, 21, 22].
      * Genetic Maps: Represent gene order based on recombination frequency [8, 22].
      * Recombination Rate: Frequency of crossing over, influenced by genetic map distances (cM) [21, 22].
   * Mutation Rate: Spontaneous DNA sequence change introducing new variation [21, 23, 24]. Parameter for novel trait appearance.
* 2.1.3 Genetic Variation and Population Genetics
   * Genetic Variation: Differences in DNA among individuals.
   * Allele Frequency: Proportion of a specific allele in a population.
   * Genetic Diversity: Total genetic characteristics in a species; maintaining it is a challenge [7, 11].
   * Genetic Erosion: Loss of genetic diversity [11].
   * Gene Flow: Transfer of genetic variation between populations [7].

   * XY System: Male (XY), Female (XX) as primary mechanism [1, 25, 26].
   * Environmental Influence on Sex Expression: Conditions like light leaks, temperature swings can lead to hermaphroditism [26] (Transcript P.158, P.171).
   * Genetic Influence on Sex Expression: Genes on sex chromosomes and autosomes [27]. Sex identification markers (PCR-based) used in reality [28-30]. Some strains have higher genetic predisposition to herm (e.g., Dante's Inferno #6, Transcript P.152).
   * Chemically Induced Reversal: Using agents like Silver Thiosulfate (STS) or colloidal silver to induce male flowers on female plants for feminized seed production (Transcript P.169). Pollen viability/sterility from induced males can vary (Transcript P.152).
* 2.1.5 Genotype-by-Environment Interaction (GxE)
   * The effect of an environmental factor on phenotypic expression depends on the genotype [6, 7, 10, 12-14]. Critical for realism. (Transcript P.113, P.116, P.160-161, P.187, P.196, P.200-207).
   * Norm of Reaction: Range of phenotypes from one genotype across different environments.
   * Different strains perform differently under varying conditions (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor, different nutrient regimes, light spectra - HPS vs LED, specific LED brands like ThinkGrow vs Luxx, under canopy lighting) [15, 16] (Transcript P.113, P.116, P.160-161, P.202-207, P.225). Cold temperatures or "Fade" nutrients can induce purple coloration (Transcript P.14-15).

2.3 Breeding Methodologies and Processes Parameters
Parameters defining the techniques and strategies used to create and manage new cannabis varieties. Breeding philosophy: MHigh Dave emphasizes finding unique terpene profiles and not just chasing hype (Transcript P.150-152); Bean Fiends emphasizes thorough testing before release (Transcript P.187).
* 2.3.1 Parent Selection
   * Based on desired traits (e.g., unique terpenes, vigor, structure, resistance) [5, 7, 10, 17, 45, 132, 135, 142, 176, 202]. (Transcript P.151-152, P.170-171).
   * Phenotypic Selection: Based on observable traits [5, 7, 17-20, 127, 145, 173-176]. Critical in pheno hunts.
   * Genotypic Selection: Based on genetic information (e.g., from DNA fingerprinting or marker analysis).
   * Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS): Using genetic markers linked to traits [7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 21, 22, 131, 198, 203, 225-227]. (e.g., for HLVd resistance, PM resistance genes, Transcript P.79).
   * Genomic Selection (GS): Using genome-wide markers to predict breeding value [7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 18, 198, 203, 225, 226, 229]. Higher tier [7, 22].
   * Optimal Contribution Selection: Maximize genetic gain, minimize inbreeding [7].
   * Male Selection: Crucial. Structure, vigor, stem rubs for aroma, and ultimately, progeny testing (performance of offspring) are key (Symbiotic, Transcript P.170-171).
* 2.3.2 Mating Designs and Sexual Reproduction
   * Generations: Tracking P, F1, F2, F3+ [132, 151-155]. F1s for diversity, later generations for stabilization (Transcript P.168, P.188, P.319).
   * Manual Pollination: Player identifies plants, collects/applies pollen [5, 23, 135-137, 145, 146]. Shaking males in a room with females (Symbiotic, Transcript P.170).
      * Pollen Collection Rate: Amount of viable pollen [137]. Some reversed females produce little or delayed pollen (Transcript P.169-170).
      * Pollination Success Rate: Probability of seed set [47, 147].
      * Controlled Environment: Isolated breeding spaces to prevent unwanted pollination [23, 42, 146, 148, 149].
   * Natural/Open Pollination: Pollen drift distance parameter [23, 42, 145, 147-150].
   * Controlled Crosses: Manually pollinating specific plants [23]. (e.g., Bean Fiends x Symbiotic collabs, Transcript P.318).
   * Reciprocal Crosses: A x B and B x A to assess maternal effects [7].
   * Diallel Crosses: All possible crosses between a set of parents [7]. For general/specific combining ability.
* 2.3.3 Asexual Reproduction (Propagation for Preserving Genetics)
   * Cloning (Vegetative Cuttings): Genetically identical copies from mother plant [4, 5, 19, 31, 38, 42-48, 121, 133, 156-160]. Preserves phenotype/genotype [19, 31, 38, 49, 138, 163-166]. Standard practice for maintaining "keepers."
      * Cutting Success Rate: [133, 159]. Influenced by technique, hormones, environment, mother plant health, genetics [133, 159, 160]. Some strains are hard to clone.
      * Rooting Time: [160-162]. Influenced similarly [159, 160].
      * Mother Plant Maintenance: Keeping plants in vegetative state [4, 19, 31, 45, 47, 121, 133, 156, 159, 160]. Regular refresh of moms is good practice (e.g., every 6-8 weeks, Transcript P.183). Older moms can decline or accumulate pathogens (Transcript P.34, P.183).
      * Cloning from Flowering Plants: Possible, may take longer [157, 162].
      * Genetic Stability: Clones are identical; phenotypic differences due to GxE [5, 138, 163-167].
      * Clonal Rejuvenation: Tissue culture to restore vigor or clean pathogens [168] (Transcript P.17-18).
   * Tissue Culture/Micropropagation: Advanced sterile lab technique [6, 33, 43, 50-52, 56, 59, 64, 66, 138, 165, 169-171].
      * Protocol Success Rate: For initiation, multiplication, rooting, acclimatization [56, 69, 138]. Genotype-dependent [33, 56, 67, 69].
      * Pathogen Eradication (Meristem Culture): [33, 50, 51, 56, 59, 67, 138]. Especially for HLVd (Transcript P.17-18, P.81). Success varies by genotype and lab skill. Can take multiple attempts (Transcript P.17-18).
      * Regeneration Capability: From explants (nodal segments, callus, protoplasts) [64, 67, 68, 138]. Protoplast regeneration is a bottleneck [68].
      * Genetic Stability: Assessed with markers (e.g., ISSR) [138, 163, 165]. Generally stable.
      * Equipment and Sterile Technique: Required (Laminar flow hood, autoclave, microscope) [169, 170, 172] (Transcript P.18-19). Cost can be $5k-$50k for a lab (Transcript P.18-20).
      * Benefits: Cleaning genetics, long-term storage/archiving of genetic libraries, rapid multiplication (Transcript P.17-22).
* 2.3.4 Population Development and Breeding Strategies/Schemes
   * Selective Breeding (Phenotype Selection): [5, 127, 145, 173-176]. Traditional, slower [173]. Still the primary method in pheno hunts (Transcript P.150-155).
   * Crossbreeding & Hybridization: Creating hybrids from distinct parents [6, 20, 135, 147, 173, 176, 177]. Creates new combinations, hybrid vigor [6, 20, 173]. (e.g., Symbiotic crossing Purple Punch male with various elite females, Transcript P.167).
   * Population Types:
      * F1 Hybrid: First generation from distinct parents [5, 11, 19, 25, 30-32, 136, 152, 155, 183, 186, 187]. Often exhibit heterosis. Uniform if parents stable. High diversity for pheno hunting (Transcript P.168, P.188).
      * F2 Population: From selfing/intercrossing F1s; segregation occurs [4, 5]. Can reveal recessive traits.
      * Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs): From repeated selfing of F2 individuals [7]. For mapping/gene interaction studies.
      * Backcross Populations (BC1, BC2, etc.): [4, 24, 25, 29]. Used to introgress specific traits (Transcript P.319-320, TH Seeds explanation).
      * Synthetic Varieties: Intercrossing parental lines, random mating [7].
      * Diversity Panels: For association mapping [128].
   * Developing True-Breeding Lines (Inbred Lines - IBLs): Mating related individuals for homozygosity/stability [2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19, 20, 24-27, 30, 31, 34, 136, 151, 153, 178-182]. Breed true [2-4, 29, 151, 180, 182]. Requires many generations [2]. Working lines to F4/F5 for stability (TH Seeds, Transcript P.320).
      * Inbreeding: Essential for stable lines [9, 10].
      * Inbreeding Depression: Reduced vigor/fertility from deleterious recessives [6, 144, 178, 183, 184].
      * Managing Inbreeding: Population size, new genetics, nucleus breeding [144, 178, 185].
   * Backcrossing (BX): Crossing hybrid to recurrent parent to transfer specific trait [4, 6, 7, 18, 24-29, 136, 151, 152, 178, 181, 183, 188, 189]. Percentage of recurrent parent genome increases each generation [183, 189]. Used to reinforce traits of a mother plant using new male offspring (TH Seeds, Transcript P.319-320).
   * Self-Pollination (Selfing, S1): Crossing plant with itself [6, 18, 190, 191]. Increases homozygosity. Induced chemically [1, 25, 41]. Used to create S1s of elite cuts (e.g., Tear Gas S1, Transcript P.188) for preservation or finding similar phenos.
   * Stabilization: Reducing genetic variation for consistent trait expression [2, 11, 19, 20, 24-27, 30, 31, 34]. Goal of many breeding programs.
   * Phenotype Hunting (Pheno Hunting): Growing populations (e.g., 100s-1000s of seeds) to identify desirable individuals [6, 11, 35, 202, 204, 205]. (MHigh Dave 400 seeds, Transcript P.154; Highline 5k-10k seeds/year, Transcript P.238). Requires meticulous observation and record keeping. Taking cuts of all plants before flower is a common SOP (Transcript P.154).
   * Seed Production Methods:
      * Seeds: Generative propagation, introduces variation unless stable lines [23, 31, 36-41].
      * Feminized Seeds: Using induced female pollen (from STS/colloidal silver treatment (Transcript P.169)) on females for all-female offspring [25, 31, 41, 192]. Risk of hermaphroditism if unstable genetics [148, 192, 193]. European market demand is high (Transcript P.170). Some reversed females are poor pollen producers or pollen is delayed (Transcript P.169-170).
      * Autoflowering Genetics: Breeding with C. ruderalis [53-57].
      * Triploid Seeds: Crossing tetraploid (4x) with diploid (2x) for sterile triploid (3x) offspring [11, 150, 194, 195]. Prevents seeding. May have distinct morphology/aromas, not necessarily higher potency [196]. More variation if parents not homozygous [197]. (Post-MVP)
      * Developing Semi-Full-Term Varieties (Quicks): Crossing autoflowering and photoperiod parents [44].
   * Doubled Haploids (DHs): Homozygous lines in one generation from haploid cells [18, 33, 138, 139]. Accelerates breeding.
* 2.3.5 Breeding Program Management
   * Breeding Goals/Objectives: Defining desired traits (e.g., unique terps, yield, disease resistance, market trends like "candy" or "gas") [198-201] (Transcript P.151-152, P.172, P.187).
   * Record Keeping: Pedigree, phenotype, genotype, stock inventory [121, 152, 207]. Crucial for tracking selections.
   * Data Collection: Meticulous recording of observations during pheno hunts [45, 121, 134, 202, 206].
   * Selection Intensity: Proportion of individuals selected (e.g., finding 9 keepers from 231 seeds - Coffin Candy hunt, Transcript P.305).
   * Breeding Cycle/Generation Time: [18, 208, 209]. From seed to tested selection can take a year or more (MHigh Dave, Transcript P.154). Seed production itself is 3-4 months plus testing (Symbiotic, Transcript P.168).
   * Resource Constraints: Space (veg space for holding cuts during pheno hunt is critical, Transcript P.186), labor, budget [64, 65, 202, 208, 232, 244]. Pheno hunts are expensive (MHigh Dave $10k-$15k on seeds, Transcript P.150, P.154).

   * Waste Streams: Plant material (leaves, stems, roots, trimmed material), Used substrates, Packaging, Consumables [163]. Failed/unsellable product (Transcript P.3, P.6-7).
   * Characterization/Quantification: Waste generation rate (m³/kg waste categories/kg yield) [166].
   * Management Practices: Composting (plant material, some substrates), Recycling, Residual value extraction, Compliant disposal (metric system tracking) [163] (Transcript P.6-7). Diversion Rates (% waste diverted from landfill) [166].
   * Costs: Waste management costs ($/kg yield) [166].
   * Integration: Waste management flow prevents contamination [34]. Designated routes/areas for waste [34].
   * Future Vision: Explore processing/re-using waste for beneficial byproducts [27].
3.4 Cultivation Practices and Operational Parameters
Parameters related to the day-to-day activities, workflows, and management strategies in cultivation. SOPs are critical for consistency and scalability (Transcript P.58-59, P.67, P.199, P.215).
* Propagation:
   * Methods: Seeds (Feminized, Regular, Transcript P.153, P.168-170, P.187-189, P.309, P.318-320), Clones (Cuttings from mother plants, Transcript P.1, P.17-18, P.80-82, P.154, P.183, P.228, P.308), Tissue Culture (Micropropagation, Transcript P.17-22, P.81, P.153, P.330).
   * Seed Germination: Requires moisture, warmth (medium temp), darkness (usually) [90, 169]. Optimal medium temperature is critical [169, 170]. Dormancy may require protocols (scarification, stratification, GA3) [126]. Influenced by genetics, medium composition, light, pH, temperature [171]. Old seeds can have poor germination (Transcript P.168).
   * Cloning: Cuttings from "mother plants" or plants about to flower [35, 172, 173]. Requires rooting (rooting hormones/compounds) [174, 175]. Success rate depends on heat, humidity, light, hormone, medium [176]. Clones are genetically identical [172]. Risk of inheriting pests/diseases (HLVd spread is a major concern, Transcript P.17, P.80, P.83-84) [177, 178]. Weaker roots than seed plants [177, 179]. Requires dedicated space/infrastructure [178]. Clone shipping is evolving legally (Transcript P.1-2). VP Domes or similar high-humidity environments for rooting (Transcript P.177-178). Clone dunking in IPM solutions (e.g., Athena IPM + Stack) as preventative (Transcript P.178, P.228).
   * Tissue Culture: Sterile lab process [16, 168]. Excising explant (shoot tips, nodal segments, meristems), surface sterilizing [168]. Establishment in vitro on nutrient medium with PGRs [180]. Multiplication/Proliferation via subculturing [180]. Potential for pathogen eradication (HLVd, Transcript P.17-18, P.81, P.330) [181, 182]. Renews old mother stock vigor [182]. High setup cost ($5k-50k, Transcript P.18-20), technical expertise required [183]. Risks: contamination, somaclonal variation, acclimatization failure, genotype specificity, vitrification [184-186]. Multi-stage process [168, 180]. Meristem culture is key for cleaning genetics (Transcript P.17-18).
   * Seed vs. Clone Comparison: Seeds offer genetic diversity, stronger roots; variable growth [177, 179]. Clones offer speed, predictability, uniformity; weaker roots (Transcript P.32) [177, 179]. Cost/logistics differ [187]. Most commercial grows rely on clones for uniformity (Transcript P.17).
* Vegetative Growth:
   * Initiation: Rapid leaf/root production in seedlings/clones [188].
   * Duration: Depends on desired plant size, cultivar growth rate, symbiotic rotation schedule [188-190]. Prolonging veg increases plant/root size but requires more space/light/time [189]. SOG requires short veg period [191, 192]. Commercial veg times vary: 10-18 days (Transcript P.58, P.176, P.217), 14-18 days (Transcript P.300), up to 5-6 weeks (Transcript P.200). "Veg in place" in flower rooms becoming more common to save labor/time (Transcript P.175-176, P.198-200, P.300).
   * Requirements: Long light periods (18-24 hrs, Transcript P.181) [47, 66, 90]. High nitrogen nutrients [146, 147, 193]. Moderate humidity (60-70% RH, Transcript P.161) [48, 69]. Optimal temperature (70-85F, Transcript P.161) [47, 48, 170]. Airflow/ventilation [66, 79]. Adequate space [189]. Low PPFD (200-600, Transcript P.161) can be sufficient if DLI is met.
   * Daily Care: Watering/irrigation, monitoring health/environment [194, 195]. Fairly tough stage [194].
* Flowering Growth:
   * Initiation: Triggered by light cycle change (12/12 for photoperiod strains, Transcript P.115) [89, 90]. Some chemicals can induce flowering [196].
   * Duration: Varies by cultivar (e.g., 7-10+ weeks, Transcript P.115, P.169, P.308) [197]. Affected by genetics, environment, nutrients [47, 99]. Far-red light can shorten by a week+ (Transcript P.204). 11/13 light cycle to push finish (Transcript P.115).
   * Requirements: Strict 12 hrs light / 12 hrs uninterrupted dark for photoperiod strains [89-91]. Lower humidity (40-65% RH, Transcript P.15, P.161) [46, 48]. Intense light (high PPFD, 800-1500+ with CO2, Transcript P.114, P.161) [46, 86]. Higher phosphorus/potassium nutrients, lower N (e.g. Athena Fade, Transcript P.7-9) [146, 147]. Optimal temperature (65-80F, Transcript P.161) [47, 48].
   * Processes: Female plants produce buds/flowers [90]. Trichome development and cannabinoid/terpene synthesis occur [47, 63, 197]. Stretch period in first 1-4 weeks (Transcript P.114).
   * Challenges: Bud density/structure can affect airflow/mold risk (Botrytis, Transcript P.7-8, P.15) [198]. Requires robust structure/roots to support bud weight [195].
* Plant Training & Care:
   * Techniques: Topping (removes apical meristem, encourages lateral branching), Low-Stress Training (LST), Screen of Green (ScrOG - trains plants through a screen for horizontal canopy), Sea of Green (SOG - dense packing of small plants/clones for many colas), Lollipopping (removing lower branches) [53, 80, 133, 173, 190]. Techniques alter growth patterns, influence yield, morphology [53, 133]. Some growers are moving away from topping to reduce labor and stress, focusing on plant density and natural structure (Transcript P.182-183, P.200-201, P.225).
   * Other Tasks: Pruning/Defoliation (removes fan leaves/branches, improves airflow/light penetration, redirects energy, Transcript P.12, P.15-16, P.205) [133, 199]. Watering/substrate moisture checks (visual, meters, pot lift method, Transcript P.11) [133]. Providing plant support (stakes, trellis netting, Transcript P.200-201) [190, 200]. Transplanting (moving plants to larger containers/different zones) [90, 190, 201].
* Harvest and Post-Harvest Processing:
   * Harvest Timing: Critical for chemical profile, quality, effects [202]. Indicators: Trichome maturation (color: clear -> milky -> brown/amber, Transcript P.12, P.197), pistil color, yield/plant [197, 202-204]. Optimal timing is strain/grow-specific [205]. Monitoring trichome appearance via loupe [204]. Hash production often requires earlier harvest (Transcript P.197).
   * Harvesting Methodologies: Manual (whole plants vs. branches), Automated (machines) [206-208]. Sharp, sanitized tools essential [199]. Pre-harvest defoliation (large fan leaves) [199]. Organized workspace [199]. Harvest can take 2.5 days for a 7200 sq ft room (Transcript P.199-200).
   * Trimming: Hand trim (meticulous, preferred for quality, Transcript P.5), Automated machines (speed vs. quality trade-off) [206, 207, 209]. Wet trim (immediately post-harvest) vs. Dry trim (after drying) [207]. Dedicated trimming space [206]. Cost of hand trimming $100-150/lb (Transcript P.5).
   * Drying: Manual hanging/rack in dedicated space [1, 210]. Environment (temp 60F, humidity 60%RH, airflow) impacts time (7-14 days, Transcript P.22, P.298-299) /quality [199, 202, 210, 211]. Too fast -> harshness, terpene loss, uneven drying [210]. Too slow -> mold/mildew, hay smell [198, 210]. Optimal environment needed for quality preservation [202, 211]. Weight loss during drying [211]. Refrigerated trailers used by some outdoor grows (Transcript P.6).
   * Curing: Manual container curing (jars, "Grove Bags" / terp block bags, Transcript P.22) [1, 212]. Manual "burping" (releases moisture, exchanges air) [1, 212]. Duration (weeks to months) [212]. Environmental stability (cool, dark) crucial [212]. Target RH (container interior): 58-62% [212]. Influences aroma, flavor, smoothness [211, 212]. Automated curing (smart containers, climate-controlled rooms) [213]. Strain-specific curing may exist [213].
   * Bulk Storage: Preserve quality, stability, potency over time [202, 214]. Requires controlled environment (temp, light, O2, humidity) [214]. Evidence-based practices for large-scale storage [214].
   * Processing (Extraction/Manufacturing): Converting harvested product to other forms (oils, concentrates like rosin/hydrocarbon, edibles, topicals) [1, 215] (Transcript P.3, P.9-10). Requires specialized equipment and facilities [215].
   * Packaging: Preparing final product for sale/storage [215]. Weighing, containerization (bags, jars), sealing, labeling [215]. Cost of testing per batch is a factor (Transcript P.6).
   * Minimizing Degradation: Efficient facility layout, batch management/tracking, dedicated environmental controls, inventory management (FIFO) [216].
* Cleaning and Sanitation:
   * Importance: Prevents pest/pathogen buildup, contamination, ensures product safety/quality [133, 217-219]. Cornerstone of IPM [220]. Critical for preventing HLVd spread (Transcript P.17, P.80, P.82-83, P.341).
   * Practices: Routine daily cleaning (debris removal) [217]. Wet/dry cleaning [221]. Deep cleaning (between cycles, post-contamination) [29, 133]. System flushing (irrigation, tanks, HVAC) [20, 133]. Equipment-specific sanitation [20]. Personnel hygiene (handwashing, PPE, foot baths, changing clothes/gloves between rooms/plants, Transcript P.80, P.341-342) [33]. Controlled access/workflow [33]. Quarantine new materials/genetics (Transcript P.17, P.83, P.136, P.137). Sterilizing tools (bleach 10-20% for 30-60s for HLVd, Virkon S; alcohol/flame NOT effective for HLVd, Transcript P.82-83) [20, 222, 223]. Disinfectant use (concentration, contact time, rotation, e.g., Athena Reset foamer, Transcript P.117, P.199) [222, 224, 225].
   * Monitoring Effectiveness: Environmental monitoring (air, surface, water sampling for microbes/pathogens, e.g. EnvyCan swabs, Transcript P.341-344) [225, 226]. Rapid assessment tools (ATP bioluminescence testing, visual inspections) [227]. Data analysis for continuous improvement [228].
   * Integration: Sanitation protocols integrated into facility design, workflows, staff training [218]. Coordinated efforts with environmental controls [77]. Indispensable for sustainable IPM [220].
   * Scale Differences: Strategies, intensity, resources, regulatory pressure differ by scale (hobbyist to large commercial) [225, 229]. Cardboard is a contamination risk (Transcript P.340-341).
* Staff Management & Training (Abstracted for MVP):
   * Hiring: Finding skilled and reliable labor can be a challenge (Transcript P.2-3, P.58-59).
   * Training: SOPs, hygiene, cultivation tasks (Transcript P.19, P.58-59).
   * Team Size: Varies by facility size and automation (e.g., 4 people for 300 lights, Transcript P.4; 5 full-time for 1000 lights + floating crew, Transcript P.58; 14 trimmers + 5 cultivators for 500 lights, Transcript P.216).
   * Cost of Labor: Significa​​nt operational expense (Transcript P.2, P.5).
   * Motivation & Culture: Creating a positive work environment (Transcript P.185, P.210).
Comprehensive Simulation Parameters for Project Chimera
This document outlines potential parameters for the simulation mechanics of Project Chimera, drawing upon extensive research into Cannabis sativa L. biology, cultivation, genetics, and industry practices, significantly enhanced with details from cultivator discussions as recorded in "transcriptss.pdf" (hereafter cited as "Transcript P.[PageNumber]").
1. Cannabis Biology and Characteristics Parameters (Part 1: Botanical & Chemical)
This section details fundamental biological parameters of the Cannabis sativa L. plant, its morphology, chemistry, and inherent characteristics related to its interaction with the environment and biological threats.
1.1 Botanical Features Parameters
Parameters defining the physical structure, classification, and life cycle stages of the cannabis plant.
* Taxonomy and Classification:
   * Species: Cannabis sativa L. [1]
   * Subspecies/Varieties: sativa, indica, ruderalis.
      * Note: Traditional classifications may not correlate perfectly with genetic structure [2, 3]. Cultivator experience suggests that even within these, traits like stretch and nutrient preference can vary significantly (Transcript P.114, P.196). For example, some OG cuts have minimal lateral branching (Transcript P.182-183).
   * Hemp vs. Drug-type distinction: Based on THC content (e.g., <0.3% Δ⁹-THC for hemp) [1]. This is a critical botanical and regulatory parameter [1] (Transcript P.2, P.276-277).
      * Range: % Δ⁹-THC can range from negligible (<0.1%) in some hemp varieties to over 30% in high-potency drug-type cultivars [4-6]. Some cultivars test around 15-19% THC, while others can reach 28-35% THC (Transcript P.187, P.197). THCA flower is also a market factor under hemp regulations (Transcript P.276-279).
   * Chemovars: Classification based on cannabinoid profile [7, 8] (e.g., Type I: THC-dominant, Type II: THC/CBD mixed, Type III: CBD-dominant, Type IV: CBG-dominant, Type V: negligible cannabinoids) [2].
      * Game should support differentiation based on chemical profile rather than just traditional labels [2]. Consumer markets show preferences for different profiles; e.g., some European markets value specific terpene expressions over pure THC content (Transcript P.192).
* Morphology: Parameters defining the physical structure and form of the plant.
   * Plant Height: Potential range (e.g., 0.2m to >12m cultivated) [1]. Influenced by genetics and environment [1].
      * Hemp types tend to be taller and less branched, drug-types bushier [1, 9].
      * Range: Dwarf varieties can be 0.2m [1]. Fiber hemp can exceed 12m [1].
      * Drug types typically range from 0.5m to over 3m. Some strains can stretch significantly, e.g., a 12-inch plant stretching to 5 feet (Transcript P.114). Sherb Banger 22 known for a 4-week stretch period (Transcript P.114-115).
   * Stem Structure: Erect, furrows, branching patterns, woody interior, hollow internodes [1].
      * Stem diameter can range from 1-3cm in mature plants, influenced by genetics and vigor [13].
      * Base can become very big and thick [14].
      * Branching Pattern: Influenced by genetics and environment (e.g., apical dominant, lateral spread, balanced) [15]. Sativa-like strains tend to have more lateral branching. Some OG cuts show minimal lateral branching without topping (Transcript P.182-183). HLVd infection can cause abnormal, horizontal branching (Transcript P.80).
      * Sativas tend to have more lanky branches, Indicas more compact [16-18].
   * Leaf Morphology: Compound leaves with leaflets radiating from the petiole end [1].
      * Leaflet Number: Number of leaflets (e.g., 3-13) [1].
      * Developmental sequence: 1 (seedlings/stressed), 3, 5, 7, 9, then potentially more (up to 13+) on robust mature plants, decreasing later [19].
      * Leaflet Shape: Lanceolate, ovoid, oblanceolate [1]. Influenced by genetics (e.g., broad in Indica types, narrow in Sativa types) [19].
      * Serrated margins [1].
      * Leaf Size: Broad (Indica) vs. long/slender (Sativa) [19].
      * Changes throughout lifecycle, peaking around the 12th node [19].
      * Leaf Angle/Droop: Angle relative to stem, turgidity.
         * Heavily influenced by hydration (underwatered-drooping) [13, 20]. Genetics may influence baseline angle [13]. Hybrids show a spectrum [13]. HLVd may cause leaves to curl or appear malformed (Transcript P.80).
      * Diagnostic Leaf Venation [1].
   * Leaf Arrangement: Opposite (lower nodes) to alternate (main stem) [1, 19].
      * Phyllotaxy shift typically occurs around the 12th node [19].
   * Bud/Flower Structure: Shape (e.g., conical, spear, round, "golf balls" (Transcript P.181), foxtail), density (airy, medium, compact, "rock-hard" under LEDs (Transcript P.202)), leaf-to-calyx ratio [15].
      * Indica types tend to have dense, compact buds, Sativa types longer, airy buds [11, 16].
      * Foxtailing can occur, sometimes accelerating towards harvest [21]. Some strains exhibit foxtailing as a genetic trait, not necessarily negative (Transcript P.120).
      * HLVd can cause "dudding" or significantly reduced bud development and trichome production (Transcript P.80, P.171).
   * Pistil Color (Mature): Colors such as orange-red, pink-purple, brown [15].
   * Trichome Density: Potential levels (low, medium, high) [15].
      * A key visual quality indicator (frostiness, resin) [15, 22, 23]. Influenced by genetics and environment [15, 24, 25]. Some strains are known for high resin production suitable for hash (Transcript P.9, P.21).
      * Can vary dramatically between strains [24]. Use of products like Athena Stack can visually increase trichome production (Transcript P.160).
   * Trichome Appearance: Transition in color (clear to milky to brown/amber) indicates maturity [15, 22, 26].
      * Visual cues for resin and ripeness [15, 22, 26]. Trichomes contain cannabinoids [24]. For hash production, plants might be harvested earlier when trichomes are optimal for separation (e.g., day 40 for a 70-day flower strain) (Transcript P.197).
   * Trichome Degradation: Can be induced by experiments [27]. Poor storage can lead to reduced trichome vibrancy [28, 29]. Improper drying/curing can lead to terpene loss (Transcript P.179).
   * Root System: Adaptable taproot with lateral branching [1].
      * Can reach up to 2.5m deep in soil depending on soil/water [1, 30].
      * Root health and development influenced by growing media [30, 31]. HLVd can be present in roots (Transcript P.83). Fusarium also infects through roots (Transcript P.84).
      * Plants from seed have a strong, deep taproot; cloned plants typically have weaker, more lateral, not as deep roots [32].
      * Rootbound plants stress plant if left untreated [33].
      * Root restriction (small containers) stunts growth, limits nutrient/water uptake, alters structure [30, 34, 35]. Smaller pots (e.g., 1-2 gallons) preferred by some for more control with frequent irrigations (Transcript P.127).
   * Visual Representation: Potential for root system visualization showing medium, water, nutrient response [36].
   * Fruit (Achene)/Seed: <3.8mm length, often in persistent perianth (mottled/marbled) [1]. Seed production can yield 5,000 to over 20,000 seeds per light depending on cultivation methods and nutrient lines (Transcript P.309). Shipping seeds is generally legal (DEA rescheduled, Transcript P.2), but banking for seed sales can be problematic (Transcript P.2). Cuttings/clones shipping legality is evolving, based on <0.3% THC in the cutting itself (Transcript P.1-2, P.276-277).
* Sex Determination:
   * Predominantly dioecious (separate male (XY)/female (XX) plants) [1, 37]. Females are valued for cannabinoids in inflorescences [37].
   * Monoecious/Hermaphroditic forms: Can occur naturally (stress-induced, e.g., light leaks, temperature swings (Transcript P.158, P.171)) or be chemically induced (e.g., silver thiosulfate, STS (Transcript P.169)) for breeding [37].
      * Hermaphroditism involves producing both male and female flowers on the same plant, leading to "seeded" crops [38, 39]. Some strains have a higher genetic predisposition to herm under stress (e.g., Dante's Inferno #6) (Transcript P.152). Sterility of pollen from hermaphroditic plants can vary (Transcript P.152).
* Growth Stages:
   * Germination: First physiological stage [40].
      * Requires proper medium temperature (8-10°C average daily minimum for outdoor sowing, or specific ranges for in vitro/controlled) [41, 42].
      * Light not required [42]. Influenced by genetics, physical factors (medium composition, env conditions) [40].
      * Optimal conditions and quality seeds yield 80-100% germination [43]. Poor germination rates can be associated with bad genetics [44] or old seeds (Transcript P.168).
      * Range/Likely Level: Germination rate can be affected by genotype, medium composition, and environmental conditions [40, 43]. Reputable breeders aim for near 100% [43].
   * Seedling: Early growth [45, 46].
      * Typically single leaflet leaves initially, progressing to 3, then 5 [19]. Sensitive stage [47].
   * Vegetative: Rapid growth stage, building root system and stems, then foliage [46, 48].
      * Needs high nitrogen [46, 49]. Fairly tough during this stage [50]. Environmental conditions like temp/humidity deviations impact growth speed [51]. Optimal VPD is crucial (Transcript P.235). Low light (e.g. 200s PPFD) can be sufficient if DLI is met (Transcript P.161). Veg duration varies (e.g., 10-18 days for some commercial setups (Transcript P.176, P.217), up to 5-6 weeks for others (Transcript P.200)).
      * Problems often begin to show here [52]. Duration modeled as 50 days in one facility example [53].
   * Flowering: Stage where inflorescences develop [45, 46].
      * Requires lower humidity (especially late flower, e.g. 40-50% RH, though some run higher at 60-65% with LEDs (Transcript P.161)) and specific light spectrum/intensity [47]. Needs higher phosphorus/potassium [45, 49]. Light cycle typically 12/12, but some manipulate to 11/13 to finish plants or influence expression (Transcript P.115).
      * Longest stage in one model (57 days) [53]. Can range from 7 weeks (e.g., Rainbow Belts, Zkittlez crosses (Transcript P.115)) to 10+ weeks (e.g., Haze varieties, some OGs (Transcript P.115, P.169, P.308)) depending on genetics. Stretch period (first 1-4 weeks of flower) can last 3-4 weeks for some strains (e.g., Sherb Banger 22 (Transcript P.114-115)).
   * Maturation: Buds thicken, trichomes mature [21, 27].
      * Harvest timing determined by trichome appearance (clear to milky to amber) and yield/chemistry correlation [54]. Cannabinoid and terpene profiles change during maturation (Transcript P.8, P.172). Some harvest earlier for specific products like hash (Transcript P.197).
   * Harvest: Physical removal of plants/flowers [55]. Timing crucial for potency/quality [54, 56].
* Phenotypic Plasticity: The ability of a plant with a specific genotype to exhibit different phenotypes in different environments [38, 57-60].
   * This is a fundamental concept for GxE modeling [38, 57-60]. Environment (light, temp, nutrients, stress) heavily influences expression of genetic potential (Transcript P.187, P.200-207).
   * Clones with identical genotype can show different phenotypes with varied conditions [3, 58].
1.2 Chemical Profile Parameters
Parameters defining the chemical composition of the cannabis plant, particularly secondary metabolites produced primarily in glandular trichomes [4, 24, 61].
* Cannabinoids: (>140 identified) [62].
   * Major Cannabinoids:
      * Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC): Psychoactive compound [63].
         * Potency often measured as % DW [64]. Levels up to 25-30% of floral dry weight achieved [4]. Some cultivars testing at 28-35% THC reported (Transcript P.187). Others may test lower (e.g. 12-19%) but still be desirable (Transcript P.170, P.197). Moisture content at testing significantly impacts reported THC % (Transcript P.12, P.22).
         * Can reach 30% in some plants [5].
         * Likely Levels: High THC strains can exceed 20%, some even reaching 30% [4-6]. Cultivator discussions mention THC levels from 12% to 35%+ (Transcript P.13, P.170, P.187, P.197).
         * Traditional hemp is <0.3% [1]. THCA flower market exists under hemp definition (Transcript P.276-279).
      * Cannabidiol (CBD): Non-psychoactive, therapeutic potential [63, 65].
         * Potency often measured as % DW [64].
         * Likely Levels: High CBD strains can exceed 15-20%. Many hybrids have mixed ratios.
      * Cannabigerol (CBG): Precursor to other cannabinoids [63]. Increasing interest in breeding [66].
      * Cannabinol (CBN): Sedative effects [63]. Accumulates with degradation/aging [63].
   * Minor Cannabinoids: Growing interest (distinct therapeutic benefits) [66].
      * Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV): Investigating production genetics crucial [66].
      * Cannabidivarin (CBDV): Investigating production genetics crucial [66].
      * Cannabichromene (CBC): Investigating production genetics crucial [66].
      * Cannabichromenevarin (CBCV) [63].
      * Cannabigerovarin (CBGV) [63].
      * Delta-8 THC [63], Delta-10 THC [63], HHC [63]: Novel cannabinoids often in legal grey areas, facing evolving scrutiny [67]. Delta-8 can be synthesized from CBD (Transcript P.279-281).
      * THCP, THCB [63].
   * Cannabinoid Acids: Biosynthetic precursors, convert to neutral form via decarboxylation (heat, aging) [63, 68, 69].
      * THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) [63]. THCA flower being sold under hemp regulations is a major market factor (Transcript P.276-279).
      * CBDA (cannabidiolic acid) [63].
      * CBGA (cannabigerolic acid) [63].
   * Total Cannabinoids (e.g., Total THC: THCA * 0.877 + THC, Total CBD: CBDA * 0.877 + CBD) [63].
      * Critical quality parameters [68]. Content variability in plant material is an issue for consistency [68].
      * Can reach 25-30% of floral dry weight [4]. Potency is a key driver in many markets, though this is being questioned by connoisseurs (Transcript P.170, P.197, P.239). Moisture content at testing significantly impacts reported THC % (Transcript P.12, P.22). Using products like "Fade" can increase THC by 2-6% absolute (Transcript P.13).
* Terpenes: (>120 identified) [62].
   * Aromatic compounds contributing to aroma, flavor, and potential effects (entourage effect) [63, 65, 70]. Produced in glandular trichomes [61]. Critical for consumer preference, especially in connoisseur markets (Transcript P.8, P.152, P.179, P.192).
   * Concentration influenced by genetics, environment, post-harvest handling [71]. Late-stage nutrient protocols (like "Fade") can enhance terpene expression (Transcript P.8-9). Drying and curing are critical for terpene preservation (Transcript P.179, P.298-299).
   * Dominant Terpenes: Myrcene, Limonene, Caryophyllene, Pinene, Ocimene, Terpinolene [63].
   * Other Terpenes: Humulene, Linalool, Bisabolol, Nerolidol, Geraniol, Borneol, Fenchol, Cineole, Camphor, Phellandrene, Terpineol, Carene, Farnesene, Phytol, Carvacrol, Aromadendrene, Eudesmol [63].
   * Terpene Profiles: Concentrations and ratios of individual terpenes [64, 65, 71]. Contributes to market demand [71]. Breeding for unique terpene profiles is a major goal for some (Transcript P.152, P.172).
   * System for classification (e.g., Cream/Cake/Cookies/Candy, Fruity, Herbal, Pine, Skunk, Spicy, Sweet, Tropical, Woody/Earth) [72]. The "candy" profile (e.g., from Dante's Inferno #6) is currently popular (Transcript P.152, P.172). "Gas" is another popular profile (Transcript P.187).
   * Total Terpenes [63]. High terpene content is desirable but can be diluted by excessive yield focus ("yield dilution") (Transcript P.62).
   * Volatilization: Terpenes can volatilize, especially during drying/curing at warmer temperatures [73].
      * Proper drying/curing crucial for retention [25, 54, 73]. Target 7-10 days dry time, 60F/60%RH environment (Transcript P.298-299).
* Flavonoids: Contribute to pigmentation and aroma/flavor [8, 63].
   * Cannflavins [63]. Anthocyanins responsible for purple colors, influenced by genetics and cold temperatures (Transcript P.14-15).
* Volatile Sulfur Compounds (VSCs): Contribute to pungent/characteristic notes like "gas" or "skunk" [63]. Unstable over time [63].
* Esters: Contribute sweet/fruity notes [63].
* Other Constituents: Hydrocarbons, phenolics, sugars [63].
* Entourage Effect: Synergistic interaction between cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds influencing effects and therapeutic potential [8, 63].
1.3 Physiological Processes Parameters (Continuation)
Parameters governing the internal functions and responses of the cannabis plant, building on the initial photosynthesis, transpiration, nutrient uptake, and biosynthesis parameters.
* Water Relations: Beyond basic transpiration.
   * Water Uptake Rate: Influenced by root system size/health, substrate moisture content, substrate type (e.g., coir's high water retention vs. rockwool's quick dry down) [1-3]. VPD heavily influences uptake (Transcript P.125, P.235).
   * Aquaporin activity (e.g., PIP aquaporins) may play a role at a molecular level [2].
   * Leaf Water Potential: Measure of plant water stress. Influenced by substrate moisture, humidity, airflow, transpiration rate.
   * Stomatal Response: Opening and closing of stomata to regulate gas exchange and water loss.
      * Influenced by light intensity, CO2 levels, humidity, wind. Can be reduced in later maturation stages [4]. Far-red light at end of day can influence stomatal closure and plant sleep cycles (Transcript P.203).
* Carbon Metabolism:
   * Carbon Fixation Rate: Directly related to photosynthetic rate.
   * Photoassimilate Production: Synthesis of sugars.
   * Photoassimilate Partitioning: Allocation of sugars to different plant parts (roots, shoots, leaves, flowers).
      * Influenced by growth stage, nutrient availability (e.g., Nitrogen for vegetative growth vs. Phosphorus for flowering/bud development) [5]. Late flower N restriction (e.g., using "Fade") encourages resource allocation to flowers (Transcript P.7-9, P.15).
* Hormonal Regulation: Internal plant hormones (phytohormones) play crucial roles in growth, development, and responses to environment and stress.
   * Auxins: Involved in root development, apical dominance, vegetative growth. Auxin activity typically decreases during flowering transition [6].
   * Cytokinins: Promote cell division, shoot development. Certain cytokinins increase during flowering transition [6].
      * Meta-topolin (mT), a natural cytokinin, is effective for shoot proliferation in tissue culture [7].
   * Gibberellins: Involved in stem elongation (e.g., "stretch" at flowering onset) [6].
   * Abscisic Acid (ABA): Stress hormone, involved in stomatal closure and dormancy. Increases under drought stress. Drought stress (generative steering) is a key crop steering technique (Transcript P.122-123).
   * Ethylene: Involved in senescence, ripening, stress responses.
   * Brassinosteroids: Promote growth and stress tolerance.
   * Phytohormone Balance: The relative levels and interactions of these hormones regulate developmental transitions (e.g., vegetative to flowering, re-vegetation) [6, 8].
      * Mother plants in long-term vegetative state may experience subtle changes in hormonal balance [4].
* Nutrient Mobility and Translocation: Movement of absorbed nutrients within the plant (e.g., from older leaves to new growth/flowers).
   * Efficiency may diminish with physiological age [4]. Nitrogen is highly mobile and translocated from fan leaves during late flower if root zone N is restricted (e.g. when using "Fade") (Transcript P.8, P.15). Calcium is immobile; deficiencies (e.g., from flushing with straight RO water or pulling Core too early) can lead to issues like bud rot (Transcript P.7-8, P.12).
* Resource Remobilization: Breakdown of macromolecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids) in senescing tissues and transport of resulting nutrients to other parts of the plant [9].
   * Occurs in older leaves even in vegetative mothers [4]. Crucial for reproductive success in nature [9]. This is a key mechanism during "Fade" or flushing (Transcript P.8, P.15).
* Developmental Plasticity: Ability to alter growth patterns in response to environmental cues (e.g., branching patterns influenced by light distribution, nutrient availability) [10].
* Circadian Rhythms: Internal biological clock regulating daily physiological processes (e.g., photosynthesis, transpiration, flowering time). Interacts with photoperiod. Use of far-red light to signal end-of-day can influence these rhythms (Transcript P.203).
1.4 Stress Responses Parameters
Parameters defining how the cannabis plant reacts to and is affected by various abiotic and biotic stressors, and its ability to tolerate them. Stress can impact yield, quality, and even chemotype. Strategic stress (e.g., controlled drought, specific nutrient withdrawal like "Fade") can enhance desired traits like terpene and cannabinoid production (Transcript P.8, P.122-124).
* Abiotic Stress Responses: Responses to non-living environmental factors.
   * Drought Stress: (Intentional for generative steering)
      * Physiological Effects: Reduced stomatal conductance, decreased photosynthesis, wilting, reduced transpiration.
      * Can induce changes in leaf water potential [11]. Induces hormonal responses for survival and reproduction (Transcript P.122).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced biomass, lower flower yield.
      * Controlled drought stress in flowering stage can increase inflorescence dry weight and cannabinoid content [12]. Key part of "generative steering" by manipulating drybacks (Transcript P.11, P.122-123).
      * Chemotype Effects: May increase cannabinoid/terpene concentration (due to reduced biomass/water content or stress-induced synthesis) or decrease total production (due to reduced metabolic activity) [11, 13]. (Transcript P.8, P.124).
      * Stress-induced synthesis vs. dilution [13].
   * Heat Stress:
      * Physiological Effects: Denaturation of enzymes, impaired photosynthesis, increased respiration, heat shock protein production.
      * Can cause managing temperature to be critical for quality [14]. Excessive heat can stress plants, leading to reduced quality or hermaphroditism (Transcript P.158, P.171).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced flower development, wilting, leaf damage.
      * Chemotype Effects: Can degrade cannabinoids (e.g., THC) and volatilize terpenes, reducing overall potency and aroma profile [14].
   * Cold Stress:
      * Physiological Effects: Reduced enzymatic activity, membrane damage, impaired nutrient uptake.
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, leaf damage, reduced yield.
      * Chemotype Effects: Can impact cannabinoid/terpene synthesis.
      * Some varieties may show color changes (e.g., purple hues) in response to cold [15]. This is a common technique to enhance "bag appeal" (Transcript P.14-15). Colder water at end of flower can also induce color (Transcript P.14).
   * Light Stress (Too High/Low Intensity):
      * Physiological Effects: Photoinhibition (damage to photosynthetic apparatus) from excessive light [16].
      * Reduced photosynthesis from insufficient light. Plants growing into lights will burn (Transcript P.114).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Leaf burn, stunted growth, reduced yield from excessive light.
      * Leggy growth, low yield from insufficient light.
      * Chemotype Effects: Optimal light intensity and spectrum are crucial for cannabinoid and terpene production [17-19]. Some genetics are more sensitive to high PPFD than others (e.g., old Indicas) (Transcript P.116).
      * UV light can stimulate cannabinoid production (protective mechanism) [20, 21], but excessive UV can be damaging.
      * Different light spectra affect morphological, physiological, and chemical parameters [17, 22]. Far-red can influence flowering time and stretch (Transcript P.203). Mixed HPS/LED can give unique expressions (Transcript P.202-207).
   * Nutrient Deficiency/Toxicity:
      * Physiological Effects: Impaired metabolic processes, reduced photosynthesis, visible symptoms (e.g., leaf yellowing from N deficiency, brown spots from P deficiency/toxicity, leaf burn from nutrient excess/toxicity) [23, 24]. Calcium deficiency in late flower can lead to bud rot (Transcript P.7-8).
      * Can trigger/accelerate senescence [25]. Removing core nutrients (e.g., Athena ProLine Core) too early or using straight RO water can cause deficiencies (Transcript P.8, P.12).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced biomass, lower yield [5, 23, 24].
      * Nutrient imbalance can restrict development [26]. Overwatering can lead to nutrient lockout or root issues mistaken for deficiencies (Transcript P.11).
      * Chemotype Effects: Nutrient availability significantly impacts cannabinoid and terpene biosynthesis and concentration [18, 27, 28].
      * High Nitrogen can decrease cannabinoid/terpene concentration while increasing biomass (dilution effect) [5, 29]. This is a reason for products like "Fade" (Transcript P.7-9).
      * Phosphorus is conventionally supplied at high amounts for optimal function and yield, but deficiency at vegetative stage impacts functional phenotyping and ionome [30].
   * Waterlogged Soil/Root Zone Hypoxia:
      * Physiological Effects: Root damage, impaired nutrient/water uptake, reduced oxygen availability to roots. Increased risk with overwatering, especially in dense media like coco if not managed (Transcript P.11, P.126).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Wilting, stunted growth, root rot susceptibility [31], reduced yield.
      * Chemotype Effects: Reduced plant health negatively impacts secondary metabolite production.
   * Salinity Stress: Accumulation of soluble salts in the root zone, particularly in hydroponics/soilless media [26]. High EC in media due to insufficient runoff or excessive drybacks (Transcript P.123, P.158).
      * Physiological Effects: Impaired water uptake, ion toxicity.
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Stunted growth, reduced yield. Lockout of other nutrients.
      * Chemotype Effects: Can impact metabolite profiles. Extreme EC can burn plants.
* Biotic Stress Responses: Responses to living organisms.
   * Pest Infestation: (See also 1.6 Pest/Disease Resistance Parameters)
      * Damage Types: Feeding damage (leaf loss, tissue damage), disease transmission, growth hindrance [32, 33]. Thrips, mites mentioned as common problems (Transcript P.80, P.179).
      * Physiological Effects: Allocation of resources to defense mechanisms (e.g., production of defensive compounds).
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Reduced vigor, stunted growth, significant yield loss [32, 33].
      * Trichome damage/loss can directly reduce cannabinoid/terpene yield [34].
   * Pathogen Infection: (See also 1.6 Pest/Disease Resistance Parameters)
      * Damage Types: Tissue damage, impaired physiological function (e.g., nutrient/water transport, photosynthesis), systemic infection [32, 35]. Bud rot (Botrytis) is a major concern, linked to calcium deficiency and high humidity (Transcript P.7-8, P.15). Fusarium is a root pathogen, no cure, spreads via water (Transcript P.84). HLVd causes stunting, dudding, reduced quality (Transcript P.3, P.16, P.80, P.171).
      * Physiological Effects: Activation of plant immune response, production of defense compounds.
      * Older mothers may have potentially weakened immune response or chronic stress leading to higher susceptibility [34].
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Reduced vigor, stunted growth, wilting, necrosis, significant yield loss [32, 35]. HLVd can devastate crops (Transcript P.3, P.16-17).
      * Can be mistaken for age-related decline [34]. Systemic pathogens like HLVd cause stunting and reduced trichome production/yields [34].
   * Competition (Light, Nutrients, Water, Space): Competition from other cannabis plants or companion plants [36].
      * Physiological Effects: Altered growth patterns (e.g., reaching for light), reduced resource uptake efficiency.
      * Growth/Yield Effects: Reduced individual plant yield. Plant spacing is important for maximizing yield per area [37, 38]. Density of 1.6 plants/sq ft mentioned (Transcript P.183).
   * Stress-Induced Senescence: Premature aging and death of plant tissues or the whole plant due to severe or prolonged stress [9]. Can be desirable at end of flower (e.g., with "Fade") but problematic if premature (Transcript P.8).
1.5 Strain-Specific Optimal Conditions and Characteristics Parameters
Parameters defining the variations in optimal growth conditions, growth habits, and other characteristics between different cannabis genotypes (strains/cultivars). Cultivars show wide variation in response to environment and inputs (Transcript P.114, P.163, P.187, P.200).
* Optimal Environmental Ranges: Genotype-dependent ideal ranges for:
   * Temperature: Specific optimal temperature ranges for vegetative and flowering stages [39]. Some strains are more sensitive to temperature swings (Transcript P.15, P.158). Some growers run 73-76F even in late flower with "Fade" (Transcript P.15).
   * Humidity: Specific optimal humidity ranges for vegetative and flowering stages [39]. Some strains are more prone to mold in high humidity (Transcript P.15). Some run 60-65% RH with LEDs in flower (Transcript P.161).
   * Light Intensity (PPFD): Different strains may utilize light more or less efficiently and have different saturation points. Some strains are sensitive to high PPFD (e.g. old indicas) (Transcript P.116).
   * Light Spectrum: Different strains may respond differently to specific light wavelengths [17, 22, 39]. Some strains show better color or terpene expression under specific spectra (e.g. mixed HPS/LED, or specific LED spectra like ThinkGrow vs. Luxx) (Transcript P.202-207, P.113, P.160). Far-red for end-of-day signal (Transcript P.203).
   * CO2 Concentration: Optimal CO2 levels for different strains, especially in CEA [39-41]. Typically 1500ppm in flower (Transcript P.161).
   * Airflow/Ventilation: Specific needs for different growth structures and densities to prevent mold/pests [42]. Dense bud structures require more airflow (Transcript P.15).
   * Substrate Moisture Content: Optimal levels and tolerance for drying out or waterlogging vary [1-3]. Some strains prefer larger drybacks than others (Transcript P.11, P.124). Rockwool vs. Coco drydown characteristics (Transcript P.113, P.180).
   * Nutrient Solution pH: Optimal pH range for nutrient uptake can vary slightly by strain and substrate [16, 43, 44]. Some growers maintain a consistent pH (e.g. 6.0-6.2) for all strains in coco (Transcript P.158). Monosilicic acid can affect pH in rockwool (Transcript P.11).
   * Nutrient Concentrations (EC/PPM): Optimal nutrient strength varies by strain and growth stage [27, 43, 45]. Some strains are heavy feeders, others sensitive (e.g., OGs might prefer lower EC than Runtz; Runtz sensitive to high EC, Pie Hoe can take very high EC) (Transcript P.196). Some run 3.0 EC all the way through with Athena ProLine (Transcript P.12, P.15).
   * Specific Nutrient Ratios (NPK, Ca:Mg, etc.): Optimal ratios can be strain-specific and outcome-specific (e.g., maximizing yield vs. maximizing cannabinoid concentration) [13, 27, 45].
* Growth Habits and Morphology: Genotype-dependent traits:
   * Plant Height and Structure: Tall/thin (sativa-like) vs. short/bushy (indica-like) [10, 47, 48]. Some strains have significant stretch (e.g. Sherb Banger 22, 4-week stretch from 12" to 5ft (Transcript P.114-115)) while others are short (e.g. Rainbow Belts, Zkittlez finishing in 7 weeks (Transcript P.115)).
   * Branching patterns (apical dominant vs. lateral spread, OG minimal lateral without topping) [10] (Transcript P.182-183). Untopped plants develop a main cola with lateral branches reaching near the top (Transcript P.183).
   * Internodal spacing [49].
   * Leaf Morphology: Leaflet number and width (narrow-leaf vs. broad-leaf) [49, 50].
   * Flower Structure: Shape, density, leaf-to-calyx ratio [10, 51]. Some genetics known for specific structures (e.g. "golf balls" (Transcript P.181)). Some LED-grown flower can be rock-hard (Transcript P.202).
   * Root System Development: Efficiency and structure of the root system can be strain-specific [3]. Cloned plants have weaker, more lateral roots than seed plants (Transcript P.32).
* Life Cycle and Flowering Time: Genotype-dependent duration of growth stages:
   * Seedling Stage Duration [10, 54].
   * Vegetative Stage Duration: Ability to remain vegetative under specific photoperiods [10, 55, 56]. Commercial grows may have veg times from 10-18 days (Transcript P.176, P.217) to several weeks (Transcript P.200).
   * Flowering Time/Duration: Crucial parameter for breeding and cultivation planning [10, 39, 57, 58]. Ranges from 7 weeks (e.g. some Zkittlez crosses (Transcript P.115)) to 10+ weeks (e.g. Haze varieties, some OGs (Transcript P.115, P.169, P.308)).
   * Sativa varieties typically have longer flowering times (10-16 weeks) than indica (6-10 weeks) [10, 57]. Photoperiod-dependent flowering vs. autoflowering [59-61]. Use of far-red light can shorten flowering time by a week or more (Transcript P.204).
   * Semi-full-term/fast-flowering strains [62, 63].
   * Maturation Indicators: Visual cues (pistil color, trichome appearance) indicating peak ripeness can vary slightly by strain [10, 64-66].
   * Trichome gland head phenotypes change over the flowering period [67]. Optimal harvest timing varies by strain [68]. For hash production, plants might be harvested earlier (e.g. day 40 for a 70-day flower strain) (Transcript P.197).
   * Re-vegetation Potential: Ability to revert to vegetative growth after flowering can be strain-dependent [6, 69].
   * Older plants may struggle more [69].
* Yield Potential: Genotype-dependent inherent capacity for biomass and flower production under optimal conditions.
   * Measured in grams per plant or grams per square foot [65]. Can be influenced by substrate choice [1, 3]. Yields of 2.5-4 lbs per light reported by cultivators (Transcript P.116, P.204). Some strains are known low yielders (e.g. cookies, lcg) but high value (Transcript P.116, P.241). Under canopy lighting can increase yield by 20-50% (Transcript P.225). Hash yields also vary (e.g., 3% vs 4-5.5% with Fade) (Transcript P.9).
* Chemical Profile (Chemovar): Genotype-dependent production of specific cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds, defining the chemovar [70-73]. Huge driver of market value (Transcript P.152, P.170).
   * Major Cannabinoid Ratios (THC:CBD, THC:CBG, CBD:CBG, etc.) [28, 74].
   * Controlled by alleles at cannabinoid synthase loci [74, 75]. Breeding can target specific ratios [76, 77].
   * Minor Cannabinoid Production (THCV, CBDV, CBG, CBC, CBN, etc.) [72, 78, 79]. Genetics control production [76, 77].
   * Terpene Profile: Specific terpenes produced and their relative concentrations [72, 73, 78, 80, 81]. Unique terpene profiles are highly sought after (e.g. Dante's Inferno #6 cherry candy (Transcript P.152, P.172)).
   * Genetics are foundational, but expression influenced by environment and post-harvest [82]. Terpene synthase (TPS) genes are involved [45, 79].
   * Unique flavor/aroma profiles are strain-defining [58, 80, 83]. "Gas" and "candy" profiles are popular (Transcript P.172, P.187).
   * Flavonoid Production (Cannflavins, Anthocyanins for color) [78, 84] (Transcript P.14-15).
   * Total Cannabinoid Potency (% DW) [71, 74, 78]. THC levels are often a primary market driver, but this is shifting (Transcript P.170, P.197, P.239).
   * Total Terpene Content [78].
   * Stability of Chemical Profile: Consistency across different grows/environments (less plastic chemotypes) [85, 86].
   * Desirable for medicinal/commercial purposes [18, 71, 85, 87]. Influenced by genetic stability and environmental control [71, 88].
* Propagation Characteristics:
   * Seed Germination Rate and Speed [10, 89, 90]. Old seeds may have poor germination (Transcript P.168).
   * Cloning Success Rate: Ease of rooting cuttings, influenced by genetics and mother plant health [25, 91]. Some strains are notoriously difficult to clone.
   * Tissue Culture Recalcitrance: Difficulty of in vitro regeneration and transformation for certain genotypes [48, 92, 93].
   * Genotype-dependent HLVd eradication success in meristem culture [94]. (Transcript P.17-18, P.81).
   * Doubled Haploid (DH) Production Recalcitrance: Difficulty in generating homozygous lines rapidly [41, 93].
* Responses to Cultivation Techniques: Different strains may respond better or worse to specific methods.
   * Pruning and Training (e.g., Topping, LST, ScrOG, SOG): Effectiveness for yield and structure optimization can be strain-dependent [91, 95-98]. Some growers prefer no topping to encourage a dominant main cola and specific canopy structures (Transcript P.182-183). Stretch characteristics heavily influence training needs (Transcript P.114). Defoliation timing and extent interact with nutrient strategies like "Fade" (Transcript P.12, P.15-16).
   * Fertigation/Nutrient Management: Optimal nutrient timing, strength, and ratios may differ [13, 26, 27, 43, 45]. Some strains (e.g. Runtz) are sensitive to high EC, while others (e.g. Pie Hoe) can take very high EC (Transcript P.196). OGs might prefer lower EC (Transcript P.196).
   * Nutrient Use Efficiency (NUE) varies [45, 99].
   * Substrate Suitability: Performance can vary significantly across different substrates (soil, coco coir, peat mixes, rockwool, hydroponics) and may be genotype-specific [2, 3, 31]. Some strains might prefer the buffering of coco over the rapid changes in rockwool (Transcript P.116, P.180).
* Desired Effects/Applications: While influenced by environment and post-harvest, the genetic chemotype provides the basis for different effects and applications [72, 86, 100-103].
   * Recreational Effects: Energetic/cerebral (sativa-like) vs. relaxing/sedative (indica-like) [47, 102].
   * While traditional Sativa/Indica labels are not fully reliable for genetic structure [59, 104, 105], market categorizations persist based on perceived effects [47, 102].
   * Entourage effect plays a role [78, 106-109].
   * Medical Applications: Specific cannabinoid/terpene profiles are sought for therapeutic outcomes (e.g., high CBD for certain conditions) [85, 101, 110].
   * Tailored chemotypes for medicinal needs [111].
1.6 Pest/Disease Resistance Parameters
Parameters defining a strain's inherent ability to resist common pests and diseases.
* Resistance Levels: Genotype-dependent inherent resistance or susceptibility to:
   * Fungal Diseases (e.g., Powdery Mildew (PM), Bud Rots like Botrytis, Root/Crown Rots like Fusarium/Pythium) [32, 33, 112, 113]. Botrytis is a significant issue, especially with dense buds or under LED lights if humidity is not managed. Calcium deficiency can exacerbate botrytis (Transcript P.7-8, P.15). Fusarium is a concern in hydroponic/recirculating systems, no cure, spreads via water (Transcript P.84). PM resistance is a highly desirable trait (Transcript P.79).
   * Mold resistance is a crucial agronomic trait [114]. Strains from humid regions may have higher mold resistance [58].
   * Bacterial Diseases [32, 33].
   * Viral Pathogens (e.g., Hop Latent Viroid - HLVd) [32, 33]. HLVd resistance varies by genotype [94]. Some strains may be asymptomatic carriers (Transcript P.80-81). Symptoms include stunting, dudding, brittle stems, abnormal branching, reduced trichomes/yield/quality (Transcript P.3, P.16, P.80, P.171). Spreads via mechanical damage (tools, hands) (Transcript P.80). Present in roots (Transcript P.83). Can be in seeds (unconfirmed for cannabis, Tumi studying) (Transcript P.17, P.81).
   * Nematode Infestations (e.g., Root-knot nematodes) [115].
   * Insect Pests (e.g., Spider Mites, Aphids, Whiteflies, Thrips, Fungus Gnats) [32, 33, 113, 116]. Thrips and mites are common (Transcript P.80, P.179).
* Mechanism of Resistance: May involve structural defenses, production of defensive compounds (e.g., secondary metabolites like cannabinoids and terpenes can act as deterrents/protectants) [20, 21, 117], or activation of immune pathways. Plant polycultures may attract beneficial organisms for natural pest/disease control [118].
* Stress-Induced Susceptibility: Stress (abiotic or biotic) can weaken a plant's defenses and increase susceptibility to pests and diseases [34, 119]. Older mother plants may be more susceptible [34]. Stress can also cause HLVd to express symptoms in previously asymptomatic plants (Transcript P.17).
* Impact on Yield/Quality: Resistance (or lack thereof) directly impacts yield quantity and quality by minimizing (or maximizing) damage and systemic infection [32, 33, 113]. HLVd can devastate crops (Transcript P.3, P.16-17).
2. Cannabis Breeding and Genetics Parameters
This section outlines the parameters governing the inheritance of traits, breeding methodologies, genetic management, and related analytical and simulation considerations within the Cannabis sativa L. breeding context. This is a core area for the simulation, driving strain development and player progression. Breeding for specific terpene profiles (e.g., "candy," "gas") and unique genetic expressions is a primary goal (Transcript P.152, P.172, P.187). The philosophy of finding "keepers" through pheno hunting is central (Transcript P.150, P.154).
2.1 Foundational Genetic Parameters
Parameters defining the basic mechanisms of inheritance and genome structure in cannabis.
* 2.1.1 Genome Structure
   * Ploidy Level: Diploid (2n=20) [1, 2]. Simulation models diploid genetics as default.
   * Chromosome Number: 9 pairs of autosomes and XY sex chromosomes [1, 2].

   * Phenotypic Selection: Based on observable traits [5, 7, 17-20, 127, 145, 173-176]. Critical in pheno hunts.
   * Genotypic Selection: Based on genetic information (e.g., from DNA fingerprinting or marker analysis).
   * Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS): Using genetic markers linked to traits [7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 21, 22, 131, 198, 203, 225-227]. (e.g., for HLVd resistance, PM resistance genes, Transcript P.79).

   * Optimal Contribution Selection: Maximize genetic gain, minimize inbreeding [7].
   * Male Selection: Crucial. Structure, vigor, stem rubs for aroma, and ultimately, progeny testing (performance of offspring) are key (Symbiotic, Transcript P.170-171).
* 2.3.2 Mating Designs and Sexual Reproduction
   * Generations: Tracking P, F1, F2, F3+ [132, 151-155]. F1s for diversity, later generations for stabilization (Transcript P.168, P.188, P.319).
   * Manual Pollination: Player identifies plants, collects/applies pollen [5, 23, 135-137, 145, 146]. Shaking males in a room with females (Symbiotic, Transcript P.170).

      * Regeneration Capability: From explants (nodal segments, callus, protoplasts) [64, 67, 68, 138]. Protoplast regeneration is a bottleneck [68].
      * Genetic Stability: Assessed with markers (e.g., ISSR) [138, 163, 165]. Generally stable.
      * Equipment and Sterile Technique: Required (Laminar flow hood, autoclave, microscope) [169, 170, 172] (Transcript P.18-19). Cost can be $5k-$50k for a lab (Transcript P.18-20).
      * Benefits: Cleaning genetics, long-term storage/archiving of genetic libraries, rapid multiplication (Transcript P.17-22).
* 2.3.4 Population Development and Breeding Strategies/Schemes
   * Selective Breeding (Phenotype Selection): [5, 127, 145, 173-176]. Traditional, slower [173]. Still the primary method in pheno hunts (Transcript P.150-155).
   * Crossbreeding & Hybridization: Creating hybrids from distinct parents [6, 20, 135, 147, 173, 176, 177]. Creates new combinations, hybrid vigor [6, 20, 173]. (e.g., Symbiotic crossing Purple Punch male with various elite females, Transcript P.167).
   * Population Types:
      * F1 Hybrid: First generation from distinct parents [5, 11, 19, 25, 30-32, 136, 152, 155, 183, 186, 187]. Often exhibit heterosis. Uniform if parents stable. High diversity for pheno hunting (Transcript P.168, P.188).
      * F2 Population: From selfing/intercrossing F1s; segregation occurs [4, 5]. Can reveal recessive traits.
      * Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs): From repeated selfing of F2 individuals [7]. For mapping/gene interaction studies.
      * Backcross Populations (BC1, BC2, etc.): [4, 24, 25, 29]. Used to introgress specific traits (Transcript P.319-320, TH Seeds explanation).
      * Synthetic Varieties: Intercrossing parental lines, random mating [7].
      * Diversity Panels: For association mapping [128].
   * Developing True-Breeding Lines (Inbred Lines - IBLs): Mating related individuals for homozygosity/stability [2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19, 20, 24-27, 30, 31, 34, 136, 151, 153, 178-182]. Breed true [2-4, 29, 151, 180, 182]. Requires many generations [2]. Working lines to F4/F5 for stability (TH Seeds, Transcript P.320).
      * Inbreeding: Essential for stable lines [9, 10].
      * Inbreeding Depression: Reduced vigor/fertility from deleterious recessives [6, 144, 178, 183, 184].
      * Managing Inbreeding: Population size, new genetics, nucleus breeding [144, 178, 185].
   * Backcrossing (BX): Crossing hybrid to recurrent parent to transfer specific trait [4, 6, 7, 18, 24-29, 136, 151, 152, 178, 181, 183, 188, 189]. Percentage of recurrent parent genome increases each generation [183, 189]. Used to reinforce traits of a mother plant using new male offspring (TH Seeds, Transcript P.319-320).
   * Self-Pollination (Selfing, S1): Crossing plant with itself [6, 18, 190, 191]. Increases homozygosity. Induced chemically [1, 25, 41]. Used to create S1s of elite cuts (e.g., Tear Gas S1, Transcript P.188) for preservation or finding similar phenos.
   * Stabilization: Reducing genetic variation for consistent trait expression [2, 11, 19, 20, 24-27, 30, 31, 34]. Goal of many breeding programs.
   * Phenotype Hunting (Pheno Hunting): Growing populations (e.g., 100s-1000s of seeds) to identify desirable individuals [6, 11, 35, 202, 204, 205]. (MHigh Dave 400 seeds, Transcript P.154; Highline 5k-10k seeds/year, Transcript P.238). Requires meticulous observation and record keeping. Taking cuts of all plants before flower is a common SOP (Transcript P.154).
   * Seed Production Methods:
      * Seeds: Generative propagation, introduces variation unless stable lines [23, 31, 36-41].
      * Feminized Seeds: Using induced female pollen (from STS/colloidal silver treatment (Transcript P.169)) on females for all-female offspring [25, 31, 41, 192]. Risk of hermaphroditism if unstable genetics [148, 192, 193]. European market demand is high (Transcript P.170). Some reversed females are poor pollen producers or pollen is delayed (Transcript P.169-170).
      * Autoflowering Genetics: Breeding with C. ruderalis [53-57].
      * Triploid Seeds: Crossing tetraploid (4x) with diploid (2x) for sterile triploid (3x) offspring [11, 150, 194, 195]. Prevents seeding. May have distinct morphology/aromas, not necessarily higher potency [196]. More variation if parents not homozygous [197]. (Post-MVP)
      * Developing Semi-Full-Term Varieties (Quicks): Crossing autoflowering and photoperiod parents [44].
   * Doubled Haploids (DHs): Homozygous lines in one generation from haploid cells [18, 33, 138, 139]. Accelerates breeding.

   * Record Keeping: Pedigree, phenotype, genotype, stock inventory [121, 152, 207]. Crucial for tracking selections.
   * Data Collection: Meticulous recording of observations during pheno hunts [45, 121, 134, 202, 206].
   * Selection Intensity: Proportion of individuals selected (e.g., finding 9 keepers from 231 seeds - Coffin Candy hunt, Transcript P.305).
   * Breeding Cycle/Generation Time: [18, 208, 209]. From seed to tested selection can take a year or more (MHigh Dave, Transcript P.154). Seed production itself is 3-4 months plus testing (Symbiotic, Transcript P.168).
   * Resource Constraints: Space (veg space for holding cuts during pheno hunt is critical, Transcript P.186), labor, budget [64, 65, 202, 208, 232, 244]. Pheno hunts are expensive (MHigh Dave $10k-$15k on seeds, Transcript P.150, P.154).

Impurities (dissolved minerals, hardness - Ca/Mg), agrochemicals, microorganisms [120, 122, 123]. RO water is common, but may require CalMag supplementation (Transcript P.8, P.115).
   * Water Quality Parameters: pH (Acidity/alkalinity) [47, 82, 120, 124, 125]. Ideal range for nutrient uptake: soil 6.0-6.8, soilless/hydro 5.2-6.5 (Coco often 6.0-6.2, Transcript P.158) [47, 106, 124, 126, 127]. EC (Electrical Conductivity) / PPM (Parts Per Million) / TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) [124, 125, 128]. Measure total dissolved solids/nutrient concentration [124, 125, 128].

Disinfection (UV, Ozone, Chlorine injection for iron/disinfection, Transcript P.65) [121, 122, 129, 130]. Monitoring efficacy of treatment systems essential [131].
   * Irrigation Methods: Drip (common with coco/rockwool, Transcript P.49, P.113-114, P.124, P.174, P.180), Hydroponics (DWC, NFT, Ebb & Flow, Aeroponics), Subirrigation (Flood and Drain), Manual (watering cans), Fertigation (nutrients via irrigation) [14, 55, 89, 124, 125, 132, 133]. Method influences water use efficiency [61]. Precision irrigation with multiple small shots (P1, P2, P3 phases, Transcript P.121-125).
   * Irrigation Control: Timed, Manual, Sensor-driven (real-time soil moisture/EC, e.g., Growlink, Aroya, Transcript P.11, P.121-142). Automated systems (e.g., Netafim, Dosatron, Edatrons with Dilution Solutions controller, Transcript P.74, P.95, P.115, P.148) [55, 119].
   * Watering Frequency/Volume: Depends on medium, plant size/stage, environmental conditions [89, 136]. Overwatering leads to root/nutrient issues, disease risk (Transcript P.11, P.126) [137, 138]. Underwatering leads to dehydration [48]. Crop steering involves manipulating watering volume and drybacks (Transcript P.62, P.121-125). Hand watering once a day for some (MHigh Dave, Transcript P.157). Greenhouse irrigation frequency varies by season (3-4 times/day winter, 10-12 times/day summer, Transcript P.297-298).
   * Water Temperature: Optimal root zone temp: 18-24°C (65-75°F) [49, 124, 139]. Affects DO, nutrient uptake, microbial growth [49, 139-141]. Colder water at end of flower can induce color (Transcript P.14). Target 2-3°C below room temp (TH Seeds, Transcript P.324).
   * Water Conservation: Drip irrigation, recycling/reclamation (condensate, treated wastewater, e.g., Hydrologic skids, Transcript P.64-65), media selection (water retention) [61, 142]. Condensate can provide 40-50% of water needs in desert climates (Transcript P.65).
   * Drainage: Proper drainage from pots/media is critical [126, 127]. Avoid standing water [127]. Influenced by substrate properties [126, 143]. Runoff management (collection, testing, disposal/recirculation, Transcript P.64-65, P.157-158). Target 15-30% runoff (Transcript P.64, P.158, P.307).
* Nutrient Management:

Organic inputs often have higher upfront cost [152]. Simplicity of 2-part salt lines valued (Athena, Transcript P.25, P.62). Transition from complex organic/multi-bottle lines to simpler salt lines is common (Kings Garden, Transcript P.59-63; TH Seeds, Transcript P.308).
   * Nutrient Solution Management (Hydroponics/Soilless): Precise control of EC/PPM, pH, temperature, DO [49, 106, 124, 128, 139]. Nutrient uptake efficiency [49, 55]. Nutrient partitioning [148]. Nutrient lockout (pH imbalances, ion competition, salt buildup from high EC/inadequate runoff, Transcript P.11, P.123, P.158) [100, 149]. Precise nutrient plans needed [153]. Athena ProLine often run at 3.0 EC (Transcript P.12, P.15, P.126, P.157, P.175, P.221). Blended line can be pushed with or without runoff (Transcript P.25).
   * Nutrient Application: Fertigation (via irrigation) [55, 151]. Top dressing [151]. Foliar spraying (e.g. Athena Stack, IPM, Transcript P.160, P.178) [52]. Rate depends on plant maturity, stage, other factors [69, 124]. Increase concentration with maturity, peak flowering, reduce pre-harvest [124].
   * Nutrient Uptake: Influenced by nutrient availability, concentration, form, pH (coco 6.0-6.2, Transcript P.158), substrate type, root health, water temperature, DO [49, 125, 126, 139, 140]. Nutrient uptake efficiency [148].
   * Nutrient Deficiency/Toxicity: Visual symptoms (chlorosis, necrosis, stunting, leaf deformation, tip burn) [79, 100, 154]. Can interact with pH imbalances [100]. Diagnosis requires visual cues, data (EC/PPM, pH of feed and runoff, Transcript P.11, P.157-158), tissue analysis [100, 148]. Flushing with straight RO or pulling Core nutrients too early can cause Ca deficiency/bud rot (Transcript P.7-8, P.12).
   * Nutrient Recycling/Recirculation: Feasibility/cost-effectiveness for large-scale operations [155]. Requires water treatment skids (Hydrologic, Transcript P.64-65). Risk of pathogen spread (Fusarium, Transcript P.84).

   * Measurement: Electricity (kWh), Natural Gas (for heating) [110]. Energy Use Intensity (kWh/kg flower; kWh/m²/yr) [61]. Power Demand (Peak kW, load factor) [61]. Lighting Efficacy (μmol/J) [61]. Electricity costs can be significant (e.g., 6-17 cents/kWh, up to 42 cents in CA, Transcript P.5).
   * Energy Efficiency: Energy-efficient HVAC technologies [108, 160]. LED lights (more efficient, less heat than HPS, Transcript P.61-62, P.113, P.160-161, P.202, P.223-224) [60, 61, 87, 161]. Optimized environmental control strategies [50]. Building envelope optimization (insulation, air seal) [162]. Smart control strategies (VSDs, MPC, AI/ML) [42, 160].

3.4 Cultivation Practices and Operational Parameters
Parameters related to the day-to-day activities, workflows, and management strategies in cultivation. SOPs are critical for consistency and scalability (Transcript P.58-59, P.67, P.199, P.215).
* Propagation:
   * Methods: Seeds (Feminized, Regular, Transcript P.153, P.168-170, P.187-189, P.309, P.318-320), Clones (Cuttings from mother plants, Transcript P.1, P.17-18, P.80-82, P.154, P.183, P.228, P.308), Tissue Culture (Micropropagation, Transcript P.17-22, P.81, P.153, P.330).
   * Seed Germination: Requires moisture, warmth (medium temp), darkness (usually) [90, 169]. Optimal medium temperature is critical [169, 170]. Dormancy may require protocols (scarification, stratification, GA3) [126]. Influenced by genetics, medium composition, light, pH, temperature [171]. Old seeds can have poor germination (Transcript P.168).
   * Cloning: Cuttings from "mother plants" or plants about to flower [35, 172, 173]. Requires rooting (rooting hormones/compounds) [174, 175]. Success rate depends on heat, humidity, light, hormone, medium [176]. Clones are genetically identical [172]. Risk of inheriting pests/diseases (HLVd spread is a major concern, Transcript P.17, P.80, P.83-84) [177, 178]. Weaker roots than seed plants [177, 179]. Requires dedicated space/infrastructure [178]. Clone shipping is evolving legally (Transcript P.1-2). VP Domes or similar high-humidity environments for rooting (Transcript P.177-178). Clone dunking in IPM solutions (e.g., Athena IPM + Stack) as preventative (Transcript P.178, P.228).
   * Tissue Culture: Sterile lab process [16, 168]. Excising explant (shoot tips, nodal segments, meristems), surface sterilizing [168]. Establishment in vitro on nutrient medium with PGRs [180]. Multiplication/Proliferation via subculturing [180]. Potential for pathogen eradication (HLVd, Transcript P.17-18, P.81, P.330) [181, 182]. Renews old mother stock vigor [182]. High setup cost ($5k-50k, Transcript P.18-20), technical expertise required [183]. Risks: contamination, somaclonal variation, acclimatization failure, genotype specificity, vitrification [184-186]. Multi-stage process [168, 180]. Meristem culture is key for cleaning genetics (Transcript P.17-18).
   * Seed vs. Clone Comparison: Seeds offer genetic diversity, stronger roots; variable growth [177, 179]. Clones offer speed, predictability, uniformity; weaker roots (Transcript P.32) [177, 179]. Cost/logistics differ [187]. Most commercial grows rely on clones for uniformity (Transcript P.17).
* Vegetative Growth:
   * Initiation: Rapid leaf/root production in seedlings/clones [188].
   * Duration: Depends on desired plant size, cultivar growth rate, symbiotic rotation schedule [188-190]. Prolonging veg increases plant/root size but requires more space/light/time [189]. SOG requires short veg period [191, 192]. Commercial veg times vary: 10-18 days (Transcript P.58, P.176, P.217), 14-18 days (Transcript P.300), up to 5-6 weeks (Transcript P.200). "Veg in place" in flower rooms becoming more common to save labor/time (Transcript P.175-176, P.198-200, P.300).
   * Requirements: Long light periods (18-24 hrs, Transcript P.181) [47, 66, 90]. High nitrogen nutrients [146, 147, 193]. Moderate humidity (60-70% RH, Transcript P.161) [48, 69]. Optimal temperature (70-85F, Transcript P.161) [47, 48, 170]. Airflow/ventilation [66, 79]. Adequate space [189]. Low PPFD (200-600, Transcript P.161) can be sufficient if DLI is met.
   * Daily Care: Watering/irrigation, monitoring health/environment [194, 195]. Fairly tough stage [194].
* Flowering Growth:
   * Initiation: Triggered by light cycle change (12/12 for photoperiod strains, Transcript P.115) [89, 90]. Some chemicals can induce flowering [196].
   * Duration: Varies by cultivar (e.g., 7-10+ weeks, Transcript P.115, P.169, P.308) [197]. Affected by genetics, environment, nutrients [47, 99]. Far-red light can shorten by a week+ (Transcript P.204). 11/13 light cycle to push finish (Transcript P.115).
   * Requirements: Strict 12 hrs light / 12 hrs uninterrupted dark for photoperiod strains [89-91]. Lower humidity (40-65% RH, Transcript P.15, P.161) [46, 48]. Intense light (high PPFD, 800-1500+ with CO2, Transcript P.114, P.161) [46, 86]. Higher phosphorus/potassium nutrients, lower N (e.g. Athena Fade, Transcript P.7-9) [146, 147]. Optimal temperature (65-80F, Transcript P.161) [47, 48].
   * Processes: Female plants produce buds/flowers [90]. Trichome development and cannabinoid/terpene synthesis occur [47, 63, 197]. Stretch period in first 1-4 weeks (Transcript P.114).
   * Challenges: Bud density/structure can affect airflow/mold risk (Botrytis, Transcript P.7-8, P.15) [198]. Requires robust structure/roots to support bud weight [195].
* Plant Training & Care:
   * Techniques: Topping (removes apical meristem, encourages lateral branching), Low-Stress Training (LST), Screen of Green (ScrOG - trains plants through a screen for horizontal canopy), Sea of Green (SOG - dense packing of small plants/clones for many colas), Lollipopping (removing lower branches) [53, 80, 133, 173, 190]. Techniques alter growth patterns, influence yield, morphology [53, 133]. Some growers are moving away from topping to reduce labor and stress, focusing on plant density and natural structure (Transcript P.182-183, P.200-201, P.225).
   * Other Tasks: Pruning/Defoliation (removes fan leaves/branches, improves airflow/light penetration, redirects energy, Transcript P.12, P.15-16, P.205) [133, 199]. Watering/substrate moisture checks (visual, meters, pot lift method, Transcript P.11) [133]. Providing plant support (stakes, trellis netting, Transcript P.200-201) [190, 200]. Transplanting (moving plants to larger containers/different zones) [90, 190, 201].
* Harvest and Post-Harvest Processing:
   * Harvest Timing: Critical for chemical profile, quality, effects [202]. Indicators: Trichome maturation (color: clear -> milky -> brown/amber, Transcript P.12, P.197), pistil color, yield/plant [197, 202-204]. Optimal timing is strain/grow-specific [205]. Monitoring trichome appearance via loupe [204]. Hash production often requires earlier harvest (Transcript P.197).
   * Harvesting Methodologies: Manual (whole plants vs. branches), Automated (machines) [206-208]. Sharp, sanitized tools essential [199]. Pre-harvest defoliation (large fan leaves) [199]. Organized workspace [199]. Harvest can take 2.5 days for a 7200 sq ft room (Transcript P.199-200).
   * Trimming: Hand trim (meticulous, preferred for quality, Transcript P.5), Automated machines (speed vs. quality trade-off) [206, 207, 209]. Wet trim (immediately post-harvest) vs. Dry trim (after drying) [207]. Dedicated trimming space [206]. Cost of hand trimming $100-150/lb (Transcript P.5).
   * Drying: Manual hanging/rack in dedicated space [1, 210]. Environment (temp 60F, humidity 60%RH, airflow) impacts time (7-14 days, Transcript P.22, P.298-299) /quality [199, 202, 210, 211].

Weight loss during drying [211]. Refrigerated trailers used by some outdoor grows (Transcript P.6).
   * Curing: Manual container curing (jars, "Grove Bags" / terp block bags, Transcript P.22) [1, 212]. Manual "burping" (releases moisture, exchanges air) [1, 212]. Duration (weeks to months) [212]. Environmental stability (cool, dark) crucial [212]. Target RH (container interior): 58-62% [212]. Influences aroma, flavor, smoothness [211, 212]. Automated curing (smart containers, climate-controlled rooms) [213]. Strain-specific curing may exist [213].

System flushing (irrigation, tanks, HVAC) [20, 133]. Equipment-specific sanitation [20]. Personnel hygiene (handwashing, PPE, foot baths, changing clothes/gloves between rooms/plants, Transcript P.80, P.341-342) [33]. Controlled access/workflow [33]. Quarantine new materials/genetics (Transcript P.17, P.83, P.136, P.137). Sterilizing tools (bleach 10-20% for 30-60s for HLVd, Virkon S; alcohol/flame NOT effective for HLVd, Transcript P.82-83) [20, 222, 223]. Disinfectant use (concentration, contact time, rotation, e.g., Athena Reset foamer, Transcript P.117, P.199) [222, 224, 225].
   * Monitoring Effectiveness: Environmental monitoring (air, surface, water sampling for microbes/pathogens, e.g. EnvyCan swabs, Transcript P.341-344) [225, 226]. Rapid assessment tools (ATP bioluminescence testing, visual inspections) [227]. Data analysis for continuous improvement [228].
   * Integration: Sanitation protocols integrated into facility design, workflows, staff training [218]. Coordinated efforts with environmental controls [77]. Indispensable for sustainable IPM [220].
   * Scale Differences: Strategies, intensity, resources, regulatory pressure differ by scale (hobbyist to large commercial) [225, 229]. Cardboard is a contamination risk (Transcript P.340-341).
* Staff Management & Training (Abstracted for MVP):
   * Hiring: Finding skilled and reliable labor can be a challenge (Transcript P.2-3, P.58-59).
   * Training: SOPs, hygiene, cultivation tasks (Transcript P.19, P.58-59).
   * Team Size: Varies by facility size and automation (e.g., 4 people for 300 lights, Transcript P.4; 5 full-time for 1000 lights + floating crew, Transcript P.58; 14 trimmers + 5 cultivators for 500 lights, Transcript P.216).
