Project Chimera: Core Gameplay Loop Definition (Minute-to-Minute & Hour-to-Hour) - DRAFT v1.1
Document Purpose: Consolidate/detail Project Chimera's minute-to-minute & hour-to-hour gameplay loops, incorporating Time Mechanic & its influence on player experience.
Date: May 17, 2025
Overall Philosophy: Engaging, rewarding loops. Emphasize player observation, learning via experimentation, strong progression. Early game: significant manual interaction, fostering appreciation for later automation/advanced tools. Cycle: detailed management/optimization -> tangible cultivation/facility improvements, at player-controlled pace.
I. Minute-to-Minute Gameplay Loops & Interactions
Centered on direct plant/environment/tool interaction, influenced by selected in-game time scale.
A. Navigation & View Modes: (Largely time-unaffected; observed environmental change rate scales with game speed).
Hierarchical Zoom Navigation: ...
Individual Asset Focus: ...
B. Core Minute-to-Minute Interaction Loops:
1. Plant Observation & Status Check Loop:
   * Initiation: ...
   * Visual Inspection: ... Visual change rate (growth, stress) proportional to active time scale.
   * Plant Detail UI Access: ...
   * Information Review (Plant Detail UI):
      * Early Game (No/Basic Tools):
         * Strain Name: ...
         * Plant Age: Tracks days/weeks in growth stage, progresses per in-game clock.
         * Overall Health Status Bar (1-10): Game-determined. Health change speed influenced by active time scale.
         * Visual Observation Log (Player-Input): ...
         * Blank Data Fields: ...
      * Mid-Late Game (With Tools/Sensors): ... Manual data entries include in-game timestamp (critical for tracking over accelerated/varied time).
      * Data Organization: ... Historical data/graphs show trends against in-game timeline.
   * Outcome: Updated plant status understanding. Perceived urgency higher at faster time scales.
2. Manual Data Acquisition Loop (Tool-Based):
   * Initiation: Player needs specific data. Data need frequency may increase at faster time scales (rapid condition changes).
   * Tool Selection: ...
   * Targeting: ...
   * Entering "Action Mode": ...
   * Data Observation & Logging: Player observes reading. Data auto-logged with in-game timestamp.
   * Exiting "Action Mode": ...
   * Outcome: New data point acquired.
3. Manual Plant Work Loop (e.g., Pruning, Training, Pest Treatment):
   * Initiation: Player identifies need for direct plant intervention. Plant growth rate (time scale influenced) dictates task frequency (pruning, training).
   * Tool Selection: ...
   * Targeting & "Action Mode": ...
   * Performing Action: ...
   * Exiting "Action Mode": ...
   * Outcome: Task completed. Time until work benefits apparent scales with game speed.
4. Manual Environmental Adjustment Loop (Early Game, Basic Equipment):
   * Initiation: Player observes environmental data. Environmental drift may occur faster at accelerated time scales.
   * Equipment Interaction: ...
   * Entering "Action Mode": ...
   * Adjustment: ...
   * Feedback: ...
   * Observation & Learning: Player monitors environmental data. Real-world time to observe adjustment impact shorter at faster game speeds.
   * Outcome: Device setting changed.
C. Core Principles for Minute-to-Minute Interactions:
   * Visual Feedback is Primary: ...
   * Learning Through Doing: ... Experienced within player-controlled time framework.
   * Direct Agency: ...
   * Data as a Developing Resource: ... Acquired/interpreted against in-game clock backdrop.
   * Consistency in Interaction: ...
II. Hour-to-Hour Gameplay Loop & Session Structure
Builds on minute-to-minute. Focus: larger objectives, significant facility upgrades, tangible progress in 1-2 hour session. In-game process duration relative to chosen time scale.
A. Session Goals & Objectives:
* Explicit, Story-Influenced Objectives: ...
* Time-Sensitivity: Some objectives may have in-game deadlines (e.g., "Deliver X by [In-Game Date]"). Real-world time for deadlines varies by player's time acceleration.
* Duration of Tasks: Real-world time for objectives with biological processes (e.g., "Grow 5 plants to vegetative stage") directly affected by active time scale.
* Early to Mid-Game Objective Examples: ...
B. Progression & Rewards:
* Reward Types for Objective Completion: ...
* Player Agency in Progression: ... Research/construction progression may involve in-game time durations, translating to variable real-world time based on active speed.
C. Core Activities within an Hour-to-Hour Session:
* Facility Expansion & Build-Out: ... If construction has in-game time, real-world duration scales. ...
* System Optimization & Experimentation: ... Real-world time for experiments/observation over in-game days/weeks managed by player's time acceleration use. ...
* Resource Management: ... Real-time resource depletion rate tied to active time scale. Reserve management more critical at faster speeds. ...
D. Session Flow & Sense of Accomplishment:
* Typical Session Structure:
1. Login & Assessment: Review facility status. If offline time progression active, review "Catch-Up Visualization" & "Facility Status Report."
2. Routine Execution: ...
3. Goal-Oriented Activity: ...
4. Progression & Upgrades: ...
5. Preparation for Session End (Stability Check & Offline Time Choice): Ensure facility stable. Player chooses desired time scale for offline progression (paused to active speed), accepting risks/rewards.
* Sources of Satisfaction & Accomplishment:
* ...
* Designing stable/productive facility during chosen offline time progression.
* Ultimate payoff: successful harvest. Real-world time investment managed via time controls, balancing speed vs. potential quality benefits of slower, "realistic" pacing.
III. Communicating Time & Gameplay Information (UI/UX)
Clear communication for dynamic time-influenced loops.
A. Persistent Time Display: Always-visible UI:
* Current in-game date/time.
* Current active time acceleration level (e.g., "Day 42, 14:30 | Standard Cultivation - 1 IGD = 10 RWM").
B. Contextual Time Information in UI Elements:
* Plant Growth UI: Shows projected real-world time for current growth stage, dynamically updates based on current time acceleration (e.g., "Flowering: 10 game days remaining / Est. 1hr 40m real time at current speed").
* Research/Construction Queues: Displays estimated real-world completion times based on current active speed.
* Contract/Objective Timers: Clearly shows deadlines in both in-game time and estimated real-world time at current speed.
C. Toggleable Time Display Format (Game Time vs. Real World Time):
* Player can click primary time/date string in UI (e.g., main clock).
* Click globally toggles all relevant time-displays between:
* "In-Game Time" (e.g., "Completes in 3 Game Days, 4 Hours").
* "Estimated Real-World Time (at current speed)" (e.g., "Completes in approx. 30 Real Minutes").
* Clear, persistent visual indicator (e.g., icon "IGT"/"RWT" by main clock, or style change) shows active display mode.
D. Historical Logs & Timestamps:
* Timestamps in logs (manual data, events, alerts) primarily use in-game date/time for consistent in-game chronology.
* May offer secondary real-world timestamp (player session event time) as metadata if useful.
Integration clarifies core gameplay loops/Time Mechanic relationship. Player time control/understanding central to Project Chimera experience/strategy.
