Skill Tree and Player Progression 1.1
Visual Metaphor: Cannabis plant; main stalk to seven "Leaves" (categories). Selected Leaf unfurls/expands: shows "Nodes" (unlockable skills/concepts). Leaf size/prominence can indicate importance/node count. Unlocking nodes: plant appears more vibrant/complex.
Skill Point Acquisition Summary: Main source: Objective Completion. Guided objectives (teach mechanics) give skill points; unlocking nodes reveals new objectives (positive feedback loop). Successful Harvests: skill points via quality/outcome of final crop (incentivizes cultivation mastery). (Potential minor sources later).
Node Unlocking Philosophy: Unlocking node introduces concept & associated mechanics/simulations. Player mastery via equipment, tools, tech progression (often unlocked/purchased separately).
