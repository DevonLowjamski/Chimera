Narrative & World-Building Design v1.1
I. Introduction Project Chimera: Narrative framework, world-building, lore delivery methods. Intent: contextual layer for player action motivation, progression guidance, evolving world sense. Narrative supportive, non-intrusive; primary focus: deep cannabis cultivation, breeding, research, facility management simulation. Narrative enhances "observe, learn, optimize" loop by framing player's journey.
II. Defining the Guiding Entity/Motivation Player journey needs starting point, overarching drive. Game Concept: storyline "player starts company, aims for best genetics/rep"; objectives "story-influenced". Chosen Premise: Entrepreneurial Innovator. Player is ambitious entrepreneur founding own company (name player-customizable, e.g., "Chimera Genetics"). Driven by passion for cannabis science, innovation, industry mark. Starts modest, aims for leading enterprise. Initial State: Basic setup; small, underutilized space in residential house (initial map). Resources limited, forcing planning, hands-on work. Core Motivation:
1. Scientific breakthroughs in cannabis genetics: new traits, stable unique strains, push cannabinoid/terpene profile boundaries.
2. Build reputable, successful company (quality, innovation, ethical practices).
3. Potentially dominate market niches (high-efficacy medical, connoisseur recreational, specialized industrial hemp). Narrative Progression Arc: Mirrors player growth: small residential hobbyist operation to state-of-the-art research/production facility (warehouse map), potential future expansions. Journey: learning, challenges, strategic investment, scientific discovery.
III. AI Companion/Advisor (Codename: "ADA" - Analytical Data Assistant) Purpose: Non-intrusive contextual info/support, guides player (esp. early game), like "Satisfactory-style" guidance ("Core Gameplay Loop 1.1"). Personality & Tone: Professional, calm, articulate, highly analytical. Primarily informational, clear, efficient. Optional subtle, dry wit (non-distracting character). Avoids excessive chattiness, emotional responses, hand-holding; empowers player. Functionality:
1. Tutorialization & Onboarding: Explains new game mechanics, equipment, concepts as unlocked/relevant; context-sensitive, non-intrusive.
2. Objective & Contract Delivery: Primary interface for new NPC contracts, research directives, major narrative progression milestones (e.g., "Phase 1 funding objectives complete. Unlocking access to warehouse development grant.").
3. Contextual Hints & Reminders (Subtle): For overlooked critical operational issues (e.g., "Analysis indicates suboptimal CO2 levels in Flower Room 2 have persisted for 48 in-game hours, potentially impacting photosynthetic efficiency.") or critical deadlines.
4. Data Summaries & Insights (Optional High-Tier): At high player progression/specific research unlocks, ADA may offer concise summaries of complex data reports, highlight significant findings from large experiments.
5. Lore & World Updates: Occasionally delivers relevant in-world news snippets, industry developments, scientific breakthroughs for game world context. Communication Method:
6. Primary: Text-Based UI: In-game inbox, dedicated UI panel notifications, contextual corner pop-ups.
7. Secondary: Synthesized Voice-Overs (Limited Use): Short, clear for critical alerts, major narrative milestones, initial new game phase intros (impact). Infrequent (avoid repetition/annoyance). Voice: clear, neutral, professional. Visual Representation: No anthropomorphic character. Presence via abstract logo, clean modern UI element, or facility main computer "voice". Aligns with high-tech, clinical aesthetic.
IV. Tying Progression to Narrative Milestones Narrative: structural framework for player progression, guides through key development stages, unlocks new capabilities (per Game Concept). Mechanism & Examples:
1. Early Game (Foundation Phase): Milestones: "Establish First Viable Grow," "Achieve First Successful Harvest & Sale," "Master Basic Nutrient Management," "Complete Initial Market Analysis Contract." Guidance: Tutorial-like objectives (from ADA), focus on core mechanics in residential house.
2. Mid Game (Expansion & Specialization Phase): Milestones: "Secure 'Series A' Funding (fulfilling contracts)," "Develop Strain with X Novel Trait for Research Institute," "Achieve 'Master Grower' Certification (NPC-issued, quality-based)," "Gain Permit for Warehouse-Scale Operations." Guidance: More complex/demanding NPC contracts. Milestones focus: scaling, advanced breeding, business acumen. Completion unlocks warehouse map, advanced tech.
3. Late Game (Innovation & Mastery Phase): Milestones: "Pioneer Groundbreaking Genetic Line," "Become Leading Supplier for Niche High-Value Market," "Establish World-Renowned Genetic Library," "Win (Fictional) 'Cannabis Innovator of the Year' Award." Guidance: Open-ended, prestigious objectives; focus: push genetic science, market leadership, peak operational efficiency. Impact of Narrative Milestones: Unlocks Skill Tree sections/tiers or Research Projects. Grants access to new facility types/maps (residential to warehouse). Introduces new NPC contacts, factions, market opportunities. Provides one-time rewards (currency, rare genetics, unique equipment blueprints, reputation). Shifts focus of available contracts/research.
V. Subtle World-Building & Lore Delivery World fleshed out via non-intrusive, diegetic methods; organic lore discovery. Delivery Methods:
1. In-Game Communications (Email/Messaging): Player company inbox receives: Industry News Digests: Summaries of market trends, fictional competitor activities, new in-world tech advancements. Scientific Journal Excerpts (Abstracts): Short, accessible summaries of fictional cannabis science breakthroughs relevant to gameplay. Messages from NPC Contacts: Contract/market opportunity/collaboration correspondence. Internal Memos from ADA: System updates, performance reviews, facility event summaries.
2. Item Descriptions: Equipment, seeds, nutrients, amendments, decor have concise descriptions with lore: fictional manufacturer background, tech historical significance/invention date (in-world), landrace origin story/cultural context.
3. Research & Skill Tree Unlocks: New tech, breeding technique, scientific concept unlock provides brief text blurb (history, discovery, in-world significance).
4. Ambient Environmental Cues (Subtle): Radio/News Ticker (Optional UI): Non-intrusive ticker/ambient radio with headlines (cannabis industry, science, world events) for living world sense. Branding on Equipment: Fictional manufacturer logos hint at larger industrial ecosystem. Content of Lore (Examples):
5. State of Cannabis Industry: Post-legalization "green rush"? Established mega-corps, plucky startups? Prevailing regulations (abstracted, affecting demand/contracts)?
6. Scientific & Technological Landscape: General cultivation/genetics tech level? Renowned fictional research institutions/geneticists players encounter/build upon?
7. Cultural Context: In-world cannabis view/use (medicinal, recreational/industrial mix, specialized applications)?
8. Historical Milestones: Past events shaping current landscape (e.g., blight spurred resistant strain research, "Great Legalization Accord," key genetic marker discovery).
VI. Environmental Storytelling (Within Constraints) Primary facilities (Residential House, Warehouse) in "endless white abyss"/"purgatory," limiting traditional external environmental storytelling. Focus on player-controlled spaces, abstracted interactions. Initial Player Spaces:
1. Residential House Interior: Exterior void; predefined, same interior layout for all. Initial state (wear/tear, non-interactive "relics" of prior life/humble beginnings) subtly tells starting point story. Unlockable Decorative Items: Acquired/crafted. Some unique rewards with lore (e.g., "Pioneer's Cultivation Manual" display, framed photo of legendary fictional breeder, decommissioned vintage lab equipment). Landrace Strain Acquisition (Abstracted Narrative): Real-world search/find scrapped. Landraces key genetic stock. Acquisition method narratively framed. Acquisition not via physical exploration, but:
2. Completing challenging, multi-stage "Research Expeditions" (abstracted: objectives, resource investments) sponsored by NPC institute.
3. Building high reputation with specific remote/indigenous NPC factions granting heirloom genetics access.
4. Discovering clues in old scientific journals/company archives (lore items) for "rediscovery" of lost landrace. Each acquired landrace includes detailed "Acquisition Report"/"Origin Dossier" (purported native environment, traditional uses, discovery/preservation story), painting picture of diverse (off-screen) regions. Future Facility Types (Potential): Expansions may add thematically distinct facilities (e.g., reclaimed "Abandoned Research Outpost," "Geothermal Greenhouse Complex"). Initial state/unique challenges offer environmental storytelling (old logs, unique hazards, previous operation remnants).
VII. Conclusion Project Chimera narrative/world-building: cohesive, motivating backdrop for core simulation. Entrepreneurial journey guided by helpful AI, progression via narrative milestones, subtle diegetic lore delivery offer purpose/place without constraining player agency. Environmental storytelling (adapted to "white abyss" concept) uses internal details, abstracted interactions to hint at larger, intriguing world. Narrative enriches experience, contextualizes achievements, reinforces satisfaction from mastering cannabis cultivation, breeding, industry leadership.
