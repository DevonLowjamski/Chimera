Genetics, Breeding, & Research Design v1.1
I. Introduction
* Project Chimera: Core design for genetics simulation, advanced breeding programs, associated research systems.
* Central vision: Sophisticated, intuitive platform for exploring cannabis genetics, multi-generational breeding, research leveraging to unlock potentials.
* System deeply intertwined with Genotype x Environment (GxE) principles & player progression.
* Goal: Rewarding loop of discovery, experimentation, stabilization, innovation for "ultimate cannabis genetics".
II. Designing the Deep Genetics Simulation
* Heart: Robust simulation of genetic inheritance & expression, managed via dedicated interfaces & player-driven libraries.

A. Genetics Lab Interface

   * Player's central hub for genetic/breeding activities; evolves in complexity/capability with player progression.
   * Core Functionality:
   * Pedigree Visualization: Interactive, graphical interface for tracing strain lineage. Players click ancestors for traits/genetic info. Ties to "Trait Stabilization (Backcrossing)" skill node's multi-generational pedigree tracking.
   * Offspring Trait Prediction:
   * Simple Mendelian Traits: For single-gene traits with dominant/recessive patterns (e.g., certain leaf morphologies, simplified basic pest resistance markers), Punnett square-like interface for visualization/prediction.
   * Polygenic Traits: For complex traits (yield, potency, full terpene profiles), interface offers probabilistic predictions. Shows potential ranges/likelihoods based on parental genetics & known inheritance patterns (details in "AI Research Lab", "Polygenic Inheritance Models"). Enhanced by unlocks: "Understanding Polygenic Traits", "Genetic Marker Assisted Selection (MAS - Simplified)".
   * Genetic Material Management:
   * Pollen Inventory: Tracks collected pollen (strain source, collection date, simulated viability degrading over time, influenced by storage conditions per "Pollen Management & Storage" skill node).
   * Tissue Culture Inventory: Manages in vitro strain samples (generation, status). Linked to "Advanced Propagation (Tissue Culture & Micropropagation)".
   * Seed Bank: Manages seeds (parentage, generation - F1, F2, BX1, etc., known characteristics).
   * Breeding Project Initiation: Clear interface for selecting male/female parents (or initiating unlocked selfing/feminization), confirming cross, initiating seed production. System generates seeds with parent-derived genetic info.
   * B. "Trait Library" System

      * Dynamic, player-populated database of all known in-game genetic traits (discovered/acquired).
      * Population Methods:
      * Acquisition: Finding new landraces or acquiring unique cultivars via in-game events or (future) trading.
      * Breeding: Discovering novel trait expressions/combinations via phenotype hunting.
      * Research: Unlocking understanding of new traits/interactions via research system or skill tree nodes.
      * Content: Catalogs traits:
      * Cannabinoid Profiles (THC, CBD, CBG, etc.).
      * Terpene Profiles (Myrcene, Limonene, Pinene, etc. - aroma/flavor).
      * Yield Potential.
      * Flowering Time.
      * Pest & Disease Resistance (specific).
      * Morphological Traits (height, branching structure, leaf shape, bud density).
      * Environmental Tolerance (temperature, humidity, drought).
      * Photoperiod Dependency (standard vs. autoflower, unlocked via "Targeted Reproduction Techniques").
      * Trait Synergies & Conflicts (Advanced Mechanic): Adds depth beyond simple additive traits; synergistic or antagonistic interactions.

         * Synergies: E.g., specific terpene combo yields unique, desirable aroma/effect not present with either alone; Certain combined resistance genes offer broader protection.
         * Conflicts: E.g., gene for extreme high yield linked with/negatively impacts high mold resistance gene (breeding challenge); Gene for rapid vegetative growth might conflict with dense bud formation.
         * Interactions: Complex; discovered via extensive breeding, research, or "AI Research Lab" hints.
         * C. Feedback on Genetic Stability & Environmental Influence

            * Genetic Stability: Game models/provides feedback on strain stability, especially for Inbred Lines (IBLs).

               * Feedback Mechanism: Less stable lines (e.g., early F-generations) show wider phenotypic variation. Inbreeding/selecting for desired traits (backcrossing) leads to more consistent sibling trait expression in subsequent generations.
               * Genetics Lab interface might provide "Stability Rating" for saved cultivars, improving with stabilization efforts. Core to "Trait Stabilization (Backcrossing)".
               * Environmental Influence on Trait Expression (Simplified Epigenetics): Direct GxE manifestation.

                  * Mechanism: Genotype (fixed blueprint) is fixed; Phenotype (observable traits) significantly influenced by environment. Plants outside optimal "environmental recipe" (Cultivation Systems) may not fully express genetic potential (yield, potency, terpenes).
                  * Feedback: Variations in harvest results (yield, lab-tested potency/terpenes) from genetically identical clones in different environments; Visual stress cues on plants from suboptimal conditions impacting development. Not gene changes, but how effectively existing genes express under conditions.
III. Specifics of Advanced Breeding Programs
                  * Players engage in sophisticated, multi-generational breeding projects to discover, refine, stabilize unique cannabis genetics.

A. Multi-Generational Breeding

                     * Pedigree Tracking: Genetics Lab interface crucial for visualizing/managing complex family trees (per "Trait Stabilization (Backcrossing)" skill node).
                     * Selecting for Recessive Traits: Requires growing larger F2 populations (from F1 cross) to identify expressing individuals. Trait prediction tools indicate probability of recessive trait appearance.
                     * Selecting for Polygenic Traits (e.g., yield, overall potency): Influenced by multiple genes. Selection requires:
                     * Growing large populations (observe expression range).
                     * Accurate data collection (visual assessment, lab testing via "Quantitative Analysis (Basic Lab Testing)").
                     * Careful selection of superior outlier individuals for complex traits.
                     * Core to "Phenotype Scouting & Selection" and "Understanding Polygenic Traits" gameplay.
                     * Backcrossing (BX): Key technique to stabilize specific desired traits (donor parent to recurrent parent line). Mechanics unlocked/explained via "Trait Stabilization (Backcrossing)" skill node.
                     * B. Phenotype Hunting

                        * Practical application of multi-generational breeding; identifies exceptional individuals.
                        * Gameplay Loop:
                        * Create Cross: Player initiates breeding project (two parents).
                        * Grow Population: Plant significant seeds (F1, F2, etc.); number managed depends on facility size/resources.
                        * Observe & Evaluate: Meticulously observe visual traits (structure, vigor, color, pest/disease resistance) during growth; "Phenotype Scouting & Selection" skill node enables tagging/tracking.
                        * Collect Data: Post-harvest, use "Science" tree tools (e.g., "Quantitative Analysis (Basic Lab Testing)") for objective data (yield, cannabinoid/terpene profiles, etc.).
                        * Select & Preserve: Identify promising "phenos" with desired trait combinations.
                        * Elite individuals can be: Cloned (new "Mother Plants"); Used as parents (further breeding); Stabilized (new strain).
                        * C. Tissue Culture & Micropropagation

                           * Advanced technique for rapid multiplication & genetic preservation.
                           * Mechanics:
                           * Requires dedicated sterile lab (high-tier "Construction" asset, potentially linked to "Specialized Facility Development").
                           * Consumes resources (sterile agar, plant hormones, culture vessels).
                           * Meticulous, multi-stage in-game process (e.g., explant prep, multiplication, rooting) - mini-game or timed process with success/failure rates.
                           * Benefits:
                           * Rapid Cloning: Many identical plantlets from small source, faster than traditional.
                           * Genetic Preservation: Store valuable genetics in vitro long-term, safeguards mother plants.
                           * Potential Genetic Cleaning (Abstracted): TC might reduce impact of certain systemic non-genetic issues (e.g., some viruses, if modeled).
                           * Progression: Unlocked via "Advanced Propagation (Tissue Culture & Micropropagation)" skill node. Requires sterile technique understanding (potentially linked to "Manual Environmental & Plant Sampling" for microscope/cleanliness).
                           * D. Genetic Marker Analysis

                              * Late-game tool for early genetic potential identification.
                              * Tools & Interface: High-cost analysis on specialized lab equipment; unlocked via "(Optional Late Game) Genetic Marker Assisted Selection (MAS - Simplified)" skill node.
                              * Mechanics: Player submits young seedling samples. System provides probabilistic "markers"/scores for likelihood of desired traits (linked to Trait Library). Allows earlier culling of less promising individuals in large pheno-hunts, saving time/resources.
                              * Limitations: Results suggestive, not definitive (environment hugely impacts expression). Analysis expensive/time-consuming in-game. Requires significant "Science" branch investment (esp. "Advanced Analytics & Research Methodology", "Understanding Polygenic Traits").
                              * E. (Optional) Advanced Genetic Modification (CRISPR-like System)

                                 * High-risk, high-reward, very late-game direct genetic manipulation. Potential future expansion, not core launch feature (complexity).
                                 * Mechanics (Abstracted):
                                 * Specialized "Genetic Engineering Lab" interface.
                                 * Target specific known genes (Trait Library) to:
                                 * Attempt "knock out" of undesirable trait (e.g., pest susceptibility).
                                 * Attempt "enhance" existing desirable trait (e.g., upregulate cannabinoid pathway).
                                 * Potentially try to insert known gene from one cultivar to another (very advanced).
                                 * Process: Extremely expensive, high failure chance, potential unintended side effects (negative mutations, reduced vigor, sterility).
                                 * In-Game Ethical/Regulatory Challenges for "Genetically Modified Cultivars" (GMCs):
                                 * Unique in-game consequences: Some NPC markets/buyers might refuse/pay less. Others (industrial/pharmaceutical buyers) might seek/pay premium.
                                 * Could trigger in-game "public debate" events or "regulatory scrutiny," impacting player company reputation/operational freedoms. Adds strategic decision layer beyond pure genetic optimization.
IV. Designing the In-Game "AI Research Lab"
                                 * Advanced breeding decision-support system; does not supplant player agency (per game concept).
                                 * Mechanics & Interface:
                                 * Unlocked as very late-game facility upgrade or via top-tier "Science" or "Advanced Analytics & Research Methodology" research project.
                                 * Players input data for potential parent plants (known traits, genetic background from Trait Library/pedigree).
                                 * Players specify desired offspring trait profile.
                                 * Functionality:
                                 * "AI Lab" uses simplified algorithms (not actual AI) to simulate potential breeding outcomes.
                                 * Provides probabilistic outputs:
                                 * Likelihood of specific traits appearing in offspring.
                                 * Potential range of expression for polygenic traits.
                                 * Suggestions for parental combinations with higher chance of desired outcome.
                                 * Warnings about potential negative trait linkages or inbreeding depression.
                                 * Cost & Player Agency:
                                 * Each consultation/simulation has significant in-game cost (currency, rare resources, or "computation time").
                                 * AI Lab offers suggestions/probabilities, not guaranteed results.
                                 * Player makes all final breeding decisions, conducts pheno-hunts, deals with inherent genetic recombination randomness.
                                 * Tool for managing complexity, especially with polygenic traits.
V. Deeper Dive Research Areas: Modeling Polygenic Inheritance
                                 * Modeling inheritance of complex, multi-gene traits is crucial for deep genetics system.
                                 * Traits of Focus: Yield potential, cannabinoid potency (THC, CBD, etc.), complex terpene profiles (nuanced aromas/flavors), overall vigor/resilience, potentially flowering time.
                                 * Abstracted Model Approach:
                                 * Avoids simulating individual gene interactions at molecular level (complexity).
                                 * Each parent plant has a heritable "genetic potential score" or range for each key polygenic trait, stored in its genetic data.
                                 * Inheritance:
                                 * Offspring inherit new potential score for each polygenic trait from crossed parents.
                                 * Score derived from combination of parents' scores (e.g., average, weighted system for parental influence), plus random variation (simulates genetic recombination).
                                 * Environmental Expression (GxE):
                                 * Expressed value of polygenic trait (e.g., actual THC% at harvest) determined by how much genetic potential score is achieved under given environmental conditions.
                                 * Optimal environments allow expression closer to top of genetic potential range.
                                 * Stabilization & Pheno-Hunting:
                                 * IBLs: Through inbreeding/selection, players narrow potential score range for traits in offspring, leading to more consistent (stable) expression.
                                 * Pheno-Hunting: Growing many individuals from a cross to find those that (a) inherited high genetic potential score AND (b) are grown in an environment allowing effective expression.
                                 * "Understanding Polygenic Traits" skill node unlocks more in-game info/perhaps better predictive tools for complex traits.
VI. Research System Design
                                 * Dedicated "Research" system adds layer of discovery, specialized unlocks, resource management beyond "Skill Tree" (broad player progression, core mechanics unlock).
                                 * Integration with Skill Tree:
                                 * Research Points could be primary currency for "Skill Tree" node unlocks.
                                 * Alternatively, specific "Research Projects" become available once certain Skill Tree nodes unlocked (leading to specialized knowledge/equipment).
                                 * Research Projects Interface: Dedicated UI section for available projects (costs, prerequisites, estimated time if applicable, potential rewards).
                                 * Unlocks from Research (Examples beyond direct Skill Tree nodes):
                                 * Equipment Blueprints: Schematics for new/advanced lab equipment, sensors, controllers, cultivation gear not on skill tree.
                                 * Technique Refinements: Improved protocols for tissue culture (e.g., higher success rates), efficient pollen storage, new IPM strategies.
                                 * Genetic Insights: Deeper understanding of specific trait interactions (synergies/conflicts), info on rare landrace genes, better "AI Research Lab" algorithms.
                                 * Material Synthesis: Unlock ability to craft/refine rare consumables for advanced genetics/cultivation (e.g., specific plant hormones, specialized nutrient additives).
                                 * Facility Upgrades: Unique upgrades for Genetics Lab, Research Lab, other specialized rooms.
                                 * Sources of Research Points / Funding / Progress:
                                 * Objective Completion: Completing "Research Tasks" or "Scientific Contracts" from NPCs/in-game institutions.
                                 * Data Analysis & Submission: Analyzing high-quality harvested plants (esp. exceptional traits) & "submitting" data yields Research Points (encourages good cultivation/thorough analysis).
                                 * Breeding Breakthroughs: Successfully creating new stable strain with highly desirable/novel traits awards significant research bonus.
                                 * Active Experimentation: Running experiments (A/B testing, environmental profiling) slowly generates research data for broader projects.
                                 * In-Game Currency: Some research directly fundable, esp. applied research/equipment prototyping.
                                 * Meaningful Unlock Design:
                                 * Research unlocks provide tangible benefits: open new gameplay avenues, enhance existing systems, provide solutions to player-identified challenges (e.g., "improve clone success rate," "better predict terpene profiles?").
                                 * Avoid overly simplistic incremental stat boosts; focus on unlocking new capabilities, knowledge, or tools deepening engagement with genetics/cultivation systems.
                                 * Research could unlock narrative elements (e.g., insights into in-game cannabis history/science).
                                 * Comprehensive design aims for intellectually stimulating, highly replayable Project Chimera experience, empowering players to master cannabis genetics via careful planning, experimentation, strategic investment.
