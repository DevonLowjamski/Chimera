1. Introduction 1.1. Project Vision: Ambitious multi-genre cannabis cultivation simulation, blending distinct game genres into cohesive experience. Key blended genres/inspirations: Detailed Infrastructure Management (Satisfactory, Cities: Skylines; intricate facility design: plumbing, electrical, HVAC); Genetic Mastery (core pillar; complex/rewarding breeding: trait discovery, advanced inheritance - alleles, dominant/recessive, polygenic, epistasis, pleiotropy - pheno-hunting, stabilization); Creative Construction & Engineering (granular control: facility design, layout, interconnected utility networks - electrical, plumbing/irrigation, HVAC); Strategic Optimization & Management (balance resources, environmental controls, genetic potential, operational efficiency, pest/disease management, finances); Data-Driven Decision Making (collect, analyze, interpret in-game data - environmental, plant health, genetic, financial - for strategy); Player-Driven Progression (meaningful advancement: unlock tech, expand ops, achieve breeding goals); Farm Simulation (core crop growing: Farming Simulator, Stardew Valley); Collectable Marketplace Trading (planned future: Runescape, EVE Online; items, esp. genetics); Real-World Search/Find (deferred/removed: Pokemon GO, Ingress; rare genetics). Ultimate goal: create ultimate cannabis genetics via mastering optimal growing conditions, cultivating superior strains, perfecting breeding protocols. Vision requires extensive research: real-world cannabis genetics, breeding, cultivation for authenticity/depth.
1.2. Narrative Framework & Motivation: Supportive, non-intrusive contextual layer. Aims: provide motivation, guide progression, foster evolving world sense; not primary focus. Main gameplay focus: deep cannabis cultivation, breeding, research, facility management simulation. Narrative enhances "observe, learn, optimize" loop, framing player journey. Player journey needs start point & overarching drive. Premise: Entrepreneurial Innovator; player founds company for best genetics/reputation. Company name player-customizable. Core motivations: scientific breakthroughs in genetics (traits, stability, cannabinoid/terpene profiles); building reputable, successful company (quality, innovation, ethics); potentially dominating market niches (high-efficacy medical, connoisseur recreational, industrial hemp). Narrative arc mirrors player growth: small residential hobbyist -> state-of-the-art research/production facility -> beyond. Journey: learning, challenges, strategic investments, scientific discovery. Key narrative element: AI Advisor (ADA), guiding entity; helpful, functional AI. ADA presence: abstract logo, clean modern UI, or facility computer "voice"; high-tech, clinical aesthetic. No anthropomorphic ADA model. ADA communication: primarily text-based UI (inbox, notifications, pop-ups). Synthesized voice-overs: sparingly for critical alerts, major milestones, initial intros; for impact, avoid annoyance; voice clear, neutral, professional. ADA functions: delivers NPC contracts, research directives, major narrative milestones; subtle contextual hints/reminders (critical issues, deadlines); optional concise summaries of complex data reports, highlights findings (higher progression/research unlocks); occasional in-world news, industry developments, scientific breakthroughs for context.
1.3. Aesthetic & Mood: Core: Modern, High-Tech, Clinical/Scientific, Aspirational/Professional. Optional "Relaxed & Cozy" feel (player choice, scale, game mode). Large ops: high-tech/professional; Small setups: cozier. Atmosphere: Realistic (function/detail, not grunge), Clean, Detailed, Rewarding, Engaging. Visual priorities: Cleanliness (pristine assets/environments; avoid excessive dirt unless player-customized); Detail Focus (intricate equipment, granular customization, clear UI data visualizations); Initial plant visual complexity lower priority (future AI procedural generation); Rewarding Feedback (clear, frequent visual/auditory acknowledgment of actions, progress, achievements; scalable; intuitive visual upgrades); Engaging Presentation (complex data clearly, accessibly; intuitive interaction). Visual complexity matches player mood/vibe. Style avoids: overly futuristic/sci-fi, heavily abstracted. Visual references: Satisfactory, Farming Simulator (equipment); Stellaris, Cities: Skylines (UI data); Two Point Hospital/Campus (facility layouts).
2. Gameplay Mechanics 2.1. Core Gameplay Loop: Continuous: observation, learning via experimentation, optimization. Early game: significant manual interaction for appreciation of later automation/tools. Cycle: detailed management/optimization -> tangible cultivation/facility improvements, player-controlled pace. Loop: Design & Build (construct/optimize spaces/infrastructure - electrical, plumbing, HVAC - in maps/sandboxes); Cultivate (plant, manage environment - temp, humidity, CO2, light, airflow, VPD - nurture, manage nutrients/irrigation, pests/diseases); Harvest & Process (harvest, dry/cure for quality); Analyze & Learn (collect/interpret data - environmental, plant health, yield, quality, genetics - for decisions); Breed & Experiment (Optional but Key: select parents, cross, pheno-hunt, advanced breeding for new strains/stabilization); Optimize & Expand (use knowledge, resources, genetics to enhance setups, techniques, efficiency, scale); Progress (unlock equipment, facility types, genetic potential, techniques via progression).
2.2. Time Mechanic: Flexible, player-controlled; balances realism/engagement; accelerated active gameplay for biology, offline progression for persistence. 2.2.1. Active Gameplay Time Scales: Player controls in-game speed vs real-world. Acceleration impacts: plant visual changes, manual intervention frequency, env. condition drift/response, real-world observation duration. In-game timestamps crucial for logs. Scales: 0.5x (1 game day = 5 real min; ~12 G.days/R.hr); 1x (Baseline: 1 G.week/6 G.days = 1 R.hr); "1 G.day = 2 R.min" (~30 G.days/R.hr); "1 G.day = 1 R.min" (~60 G.days/R.hr); Fastest (e.g., 8x/12x for advanced, stable facilities; discrepancy on exact rate, but principle stands). 2.2.2. Consequences of Time Acceleration: Proportional Task Frequency (daily tasks more frequent real-time); Consistent Resource Consumption (deplete faster real-time); "Transition Inertia" System (changing speed: mandatory lock-in time, transition delay; prevents exploits; pop-up warns; duration % of 1 G.day at slower speed - larger jumps longer; strategic, committed changes). Subtle Time Scale-Dependent Variables: Slower may offer slightly higher max quality (1-3% peak THC variance); Faster might slightly increase base probability/severity of minor stressors if unmanaged; Slower could allow more nuanced positive interactions; careful balancing needed. 2.2.3. Offline Time Progression: Saving/exiting: choose offline scale (paused to active). Simulates missed events on login. "Catch-Up Visualization": accelerated time-lapse of changes during computation. "Facility Status Report" recap: resources, crop progress, events, harvests, alerts. Offline safety tied to automation robustness, resource buffers. Process durations map to real-world time scaled by speed.
2.3. Cultivation Systems: Direct plant interactions, immediate environment management. 2.3.1. Plant Lifecycle & Visuals: Detailed: planting, transplanting, growth stages (Seedling, Vegetative, Flowering), harvest. Growth dynamic, reflects Genotype x Environment (GxE). Visuals central output, reflecting GxE; high fidelity, realistic, biologically accurate. Visuals change/adapt over time based on sim data (environment, factors, genetics). Indicators: health, stage, structure, color, deficiencies/excesses, pests, pathogens. Endless procedural subtle visual variation (genetics, factors, randomness). Color realistic, reflects genetics. Trichome density/appearance ("frostiness") key quality indicator. Procedural generation (L-Systems, Parametric Modeling, Noise Functions) via GxE rules for structure/morphology from abstracted data. AI tools may assist base textures/meshes. Initial launch: high-quality base models, core visual responses; full dynamic, data-driven visuals evolve post-launch. 2.3.2. Environmental Control: Manage temp, humidity, light (cycles, spectrum/intensity PAR/PPFD), CO2, airflow. Start manual, basic automation (timers, thermostat/humidistat). Conditions affect growth, health, metabolites. Optimal parameters often strain-specific "recipes" adapting through lifecycle; discovered via experimentation/data analysis. Deviations -> graduated negative responses. 2.3.3. Nutrient Management: Manage recipes, application, medium EC/pH. Early game: manual mix/apply, handheld meters. Availability/deficiency/toxicity key. Reservoir mixing instantaneous/uniform post-agitation. Medium properties (coco, perlite) influence saturation, retention, drainage. 2.3.4. Plant Health & IPM: Basic health visual. Few common pests/diseases modeled. Early game: manual treatment (neem oil). Simulated air particle/spore traps: advanced "Science" unlock. IPM strategies: research unlockable technique refinements. 2.3.5. Plant Training & Care: Basic: topping, manual LST. Visual effects planned: topping (multi-colas), LST/ScrOG (horizontal canopy), Lollipopping (stripped lower stem). Other manual tasks: pruning, watering/soil moisture checks (visual, then meters). 2.3.6. Cleaning & Sanitation: Clean, organized facility design goal. Player actions: routine cleaning (dry/wet grow areas), system flushing (irrigation, tanks, HVAC), deep cleaning (between cycles/after contamination). Methods vary by scale. Crucial for aesthetics, issue prevention.
2.4. Data Collection & Analysis: Transforming data to actionable insights core philosophy. Empowers observation, learning, optimization. UI/Data Viz critical "assets". 2.4.1. Data Points & Collection: Environmental (real-time sensor: Temp, RH, VPD, CO2, PAR/PPFD from player-placed sensors); Growing Medium (manual sample: EC/PPM, pH, Temp, VWC%; potential for continuous moisture probes - advanced); Plant Data (visual inspect: health, stage, structure, color; manual sample: sim Chlorophyll meters); Simulated Lab Analysis (potential advanced: tissue nutrient levels, post-harvest cannabinoid/terpene profiles; initially abstracted off-site); Operational (resource consumption, costs, task time, yield); Utility dashboard (breakdown, costs); Genetic (phenotypes, sim lab results, potential genetic marker results). 2.4.2. Data Presentation & UI: Env. Data Dashboards/Overlays (real-time/summarized for rooms/zones; customizable); Graphs & Charts (historical trends: Env, Nutrients, Growth; multi-variable plots; overlay in tools like Grow Cycle Comparator; clear, aesthetic, useful; clean lines, subtle gradients, logical colors); Sim Lab Results ("Lab Reports": values - NPK, THC/CBD%; comparison to optimal/previous; charts, graphs, lists); Breeding Interface (parent selection, crossing, pheno-hunting, compare offspring; Genetics Lab Interface central hub, evolves; pedigree viz, Trait Library); Facility Mngmt Overlays (Utility View: pipe/duct/wire networks, flow/pressure indicators; Zoning UI; Resource inventory/consumption); Operational & Financial Data (Budget, Costs, Revenue, Profit/Loss); Alerts & Notifications (visual/audio for critical issues; tiered: Blue/Info, Yellow/Warning, Red/Critical; logged with timestamps; actionable info; customizable); Historical Logs & Notes (central, searchable, filterable logbook: auto events - plant, harvest, alerts, research - with timestamps; player notes - Grower's Journal - assigned to plants/rooms, tagged); Tutorial/Info Overlays (explain concepts - VPD, GxE, deficiencies; link symptoms to causes/solutions from "Plant Problems Guide"). 2.4.3. Analysis Tools: Sensor & Controller Mngmt Interface (central UI: view/manage sensors - placement, name, status, calibrate; link to controllers for IF-THEN logic); Grow Cycle Comparator Tool (side-by-side analysis of grow cycles; KPIs: Yield, Quality, Costs, Duration, Health; overlay historical graphs); Sim "Lab Analysis" Interface (manage sample submission, time, costs, view Reports); Advanced Analytics Software (late-game: facility-level analysis, A/B tests, basic stats; requires Science skill).
2.5. Genetics & Breeding: Core pillar: inheritance, expression, manipulation. Aim: sophisticated, intuitive platform for discovery, experimentation, stabilization, innovation. 2.5.1. Deep Genetics Simulation: Robust simulation of inheritance/expression is heart. Key quantitative traits (yield, potency) polygenic; rules/probabilities potentially from offline AI analysis of bio data. Optional unlockable in-game "AI Research Lab": simplified algorithms for potential breeding outcomes, probabilistic outputs (trait likelihood, expression range, parent suggestions, warnings); significant cost (currency, resources, time); offers suggestions, player makes final decisions, pheno-hunts, deals with randomness. Initial launch: 5-10 foundational landrace-inspired strains, full genetic complexity for vast player variations. Future "drops": new base genetics. 2.5.2. Trait Library: Dynamic, player-populated database of known in-game traits. Population: acquisition (landraces, cultivars), breeding (novel expressions via pheno-hunting), research (unlocking understanding). Catalogs: Cannabinoid/Terpene Profiles, Yield, Flowering Time, Morphology, Env. Tolerances, Pest/Disease Resistance, Nutrient Uptake, visual traits (Color, Bud Density, Trichome Density). 2.5.3. Breeding Mechanics: Core: Select parents, cross-pollinate, harvest seeds, grow F1. Pheno-Hunting: Grow offspring, evaluate phenotypes (visual, data), select best for traits; elites cloned, parented, or stabilized. Genetic Marker Analysis (late-game): assists with probabilistic markers in seedlings for early culling. Advanced: Backcrossing (BX; multi-gen pedigree), Inbreeding (IBL), Selfing (S1), Feminization planned. Stability vs. Variability: tension: stable strains (inbreeding) vs. diversity/hybrid vigor (outcrossing); inbreeding depression modeled. Landrace Strains: foundational, rare/hard to acquire; unique potential (rare alleles), diversity reservoirs. 2.5.4. Rare Genetic Acquisition (Post-AR Removal): AR search/find deferred (complexity, cost, risk). Robust in-game mechanics instead: NPC-Sponsored Expeditions/Grants (abstracted resource/time investment, chance for rare seeds); High-Tier NPC Contacts/Faction Rep (unlocks exclusive heirlooms/landraces); Lore-Driven Discovery/"Lost Strain" Quests (clues in lore items -> multi-stage rediscovery); Specialist NPC Vendors/Collectors (unique, high-priced NPCs, challenging contract rewards). Acquired landraces include "Acquisition Report"/"Origin Dossier" (narrative context: environment, uses, discovery story). 2.5.5. Tissue Culture & Micropropagation: Advanced rapid multiplication/preservation. Mechanics: dedicated sterile lab (high-tier Construction asset); consumes resources (agar, hormones, vessels); meticulous multi-stage process (explant prep, multiplication, rooting) as mini-game or timed process with success/failure. Benefits: rapid cloning from small sources; long-term in vitro preservation; potential abstracted genetic cleaning. Progression: Science skill tree ("Advanced Propagation"), linked to sterile techniques.
2.6. Processing & Post-Harvest: Multi-stage system transforms harvest to marketable products, realizing genetic potential. Success vital for top-tier results/returns. 2.6.1. Drying: Manual hanging/racking in dry space. Environment (temp, humidity, airflow) impacts time/quality. Optimal for terpene retention, mold prevention. Automation: climate-controlled rooms. 2.6.2. Curing: Manual container (jars) with "burping". Develops smoothness, complexity, aroma, flavor. Stable humidity (ideal 58-62%). Longer cures can increase complexity, risk over-drying. Strain-specific needs discoverable. Automation: "Smart" containers (RH sensors, auto micro-venting), climate-controlled rooms. 2.6.3. Trimming: Manual hand-trimming. Impacts bag appeal, efficiency. Automation: machines (wet/dry); faster, can reduce quality/trichomes if mismanaged. Manage speed, load, maintenance, strain types. 2.6.4. Advanced Extraction Techniques (Post-MVP): Concentrates (oils, shatter, wax, isolates) post-MVP/late-game. Equipment: Solventless (Rosin presses), Solvent-Based (Extraction Vessels, Winterization Equip - freezers/filtration, Solvent Recovery/Purging, Distillation); solvent mechanics abstracted. Process: solvent wash, winterization, recovery/purging, potential distillation, post-processing for consistency. Quality Factors: each step influences yield, purity, potency, flavor, consistency. Progression: "Extraction Science"/"Advanced Processing" skill branch, specialized lab equip investment, dedicated space (safety features), advanced knowledge. 2.6.5. Edibles & Topicals (Post-MVP): Infused products post-MVP. Process: recipes, ingredients, cannabis input, infusion methods, cooking/mixing parameters, target dosage. QC: Dosage consistency critical; precise measures, sim batch testing. Inaccurate dosing -> rep penalties/recalls. Equipment: mixing/cooking, filling, packaging. 2.6.6. Quality Degradation & Perishability: Harvested product shelf-life; degradation modeled. Feedback: visual cues (mold, color change, reduced trichome vibrancy), sim lab tests (cannabinoid/terpene decrease, profile shifts). Market Impact: degraded products sell lower; NPC negative feedback. Proper storage needed (climate-controlled, airtight).
2.7. Construction & Facility Management: Design, build, modify facilities in predefined sandboxes. 2.7.1. Sandbox Environments ("Maps"): Pre-made, identical for all; consistent start for customization. Facilities in "endless white abyss"/"purgatory," limits external storytelling; focus on player-controlled interiors. Initial Map: Residential House Interior (small, underutilized, predefined layout; initial state wear/tear tells humble beginnings). Manage ops in rooms. Second Map (Warehouse): Unlocked after Residential/objectives; giant open shell (roof, floor, supports); build from ground up (walls, rooms, large equip). Future Maps: thematic ("Abandoned Research Outpost," "Geothermal Greenhouse," outdoor, subterranean labs); initial state/challenges offer storytelling. 2.7.2. Structural Elements: Place walls, floors, roofs in X,Y,Z within boundaries. Primarily grid-based (1ft unit). "Snap to Grid" toggle (lines, intersections, mid-points, object points). Advanced stages: freeform tools. Height/thickness by asset type ("8ft Drywall" vs "10ft Insulated Panel"); may need research/purchase. Material impacts cost, appearance, function (insulation, reflectivity), durability, cleanliness. Walls as plant/equipment mounts. 2.7.3. Zoning: Designate areas (Veg, Flower, Dry, Moms, Clones, Cure). Placement impacts efficiency, env control, risk. 2.7.4. Equipment & Furniture Placement: Essential cultivation equip (lights, fans, pots, basic irrigation). Free or grid-snapped, collision detection, multi-axis rotation. Workflow tools ("Copy and Paste"). Unlockable Decoratives (acquired/crafted) for "Cozy" (early) or "Professional" (large spaces). 2.7.5. Utility System Construction: Detailed, interconnected networks (Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC) key feature (Warehouse onwards). 3D routing (pipes, ducts, wires), snapping/free, collisions. Sizing (diameters/gauges) impacts performance (flow, capacity, pressure/voltage drop). Material impacts cost, durability, efficiency, appearance. Logical source-endpoint connections give visual feedback. Utility View Toggle ("X-Ray"/"Engineering View"): crucial for complex environments (Warehouse); not in Residential; unlocked with Warehouse/progression. Structures "ghostly translucent" revealing hidden networks. High-detail utility models. Simple, non-simulated flow animations (pulses, color changes) for feedback. Abstracted physics (zone HVAC, simplified irrigation) for performance, not full CFD. Performance via periodic env. parameter recalculation (few in-game min, adjusts with time accel), not per frame. 2.7.6. Buffers, Redundancy, Risk Management: Paramount at scale & with time accel; minor issues escalate. Backup Power: Generators (diesel/gas; fuel, auto-activate, limited capacity; tiers), Battery Banks/UPS (short-term critical buffer). Redundant Water Pumps: design plumbing redundancy; "Dual Pump Manifold" researchable. Automated Control Systems: sensors to controllers for IF-THEN logic; key for complexity at scale.
2.8. Economy & Resource Management: Economic layer evolves with player capabilities. 2.8.1. Initial NPC Buyer/Contract Economy (MVP Focus): NPC economy only for MVP. Income: selling to NPC buyers via contracts (specify strain, quantity, quality). Basic op cost mngmt (utilities, consumables, initial equip). 2.8.2. Future Player-Driven Marketplace (Post-MVP): Core future expansion; extensive, active in-game trading. Tradable: All game attributes; largest segments: genetics (seeds, cuttings), equip. Principles: Supply & Demand; game systems allow natural operation (availability/demand -> price). Order Mngmt: Dashboard (track orders, history, wallet, proceeds). Market Data (potential advanced): historical charts, avg prices, volume for decisions; unlock via "Business" skill/service sub. Scope: Global Market initially (simplicity, liquidity); Regional Markets (transport costs/risks, local S/D/regs) potential future (complex). Reputation (user/company): affects NPC interactions (prices, contracts), P2P trade (trust, value); tied to crop quality (high -> better rep/price, low -> damage); selling bad genetics severely damages rep; verify rep before trade. 2.8.3. Robust Resource/Currency Sinks: Prevent inflation, maintain value. Marketplace Tax & Listing Fees (small % tax on sales, small flat listing fee) primary sinks in player market. NPC Vendors: sell essentials, rare genetics, blueprints, services (adv. lab analysis high fee) at fixed, high prices; removes currency. Operational Costs: utilities, consumables, equip purchase/repair, upgrades, research funding; ongoing sinks. 2.8.4. Resource Management: Track consumable quantities (nutrients, medium, water, fuel). Depletion rates real-time, tied to time scale; reserves critical at faster speeds. Future: processing/re-using waste for byproducts/revenue (composting).
2.9. Player Progression: Structural framework, guided by narrative milestones. Drives journey, unlocks capabilities, adds purpose. Natural: simple -> complex. Complete, cohesive, rewarding, challenging, entertaining for launch. 2.9.1. Primary Driver: Skill Tree ("The Tree"): Character-centric, visualized as Cannabis plant. "Leaves" (categories) vary size/prominence; unfurl to "Nodes" (skills/concepts); plant grows/vibrancy increases with progression. Skill Point Acquisition: Main: objectives/tasks/challenges; Secondary: successful harvests (quality/outcome based); More TBD. Node Unlocking: introduces core concept & associated mechanics/sims. Mastery/efficiency via separate equip/tool progression (purchased, researched, crafted). Concept unlock (Temperature) introduces sim; management ability depends on other unlocks (thermometers). Leaves/Categories (Nodes): Cultivation (~8-12: techniques, nutrient, pest/disease, env fundamentals); Environment (~6-8: control systems - lights, HVAC, CO2, sensors, basic automation); Construction (~6-8: room structuring, utilities, facility types, basic automation); Genetics (~8-12: breeding concepts, techniques, deeper understanding; Seed/Clone fundamentals, Mother Plants, basic propagation); Harvest (~4-6: readiness, techniques, drying, trimming/prep, curing, efficiency); Science (~4-6: data collection/analysis, research; Observation/Record Keeping, Manual Sampling, Data Interpretation/Diagnostics, Quantitative Analysis/Basic Lab Testing, Adv. Analytics & Research Methodology); Business (~3-4: Basic Ops Mngmt, Brand/Rep, Market Awareness; potentially Adv. Economic Ops for Player Market). Interdependencies: logical prerequisites between nodes (different categories); encourages broad development; UI shows dependencies. Cross-category nodes at "Leaf" edges. "Ability vs. Challenge": unlocked nodes grant abilities, introduce new complexities; balanced difficulty. 2.9.2. Research System: Dedicated; discovery, specialized unlocks, resource mngmt beyond Skill Tree. Integrated: Research Points fund Skill Tree, or Projects available after node unlocks. Interface: Dedicated UI (projects: costs, prereqs, time, rewards). Unlocks: Equip Blueprints (adv. gear not on tree), Technique Refinements (improved processes: TC success, pollen storage, IPM), Genetic Insights (trait understanding, rare gene info, better AI Lab algorithms), Material Synthesis (rare consumables), Facility Upgrades (unique labs/rooms), potential narrative elements. Unlocks open new gameplay, enhance systems, solve challenges. Progress Sources: Research Points/Funding from: Objective Completion (Research/Sci Contracts), Data Analysis/Submission (high-quality harvests), Breeding Breakthroughs (stable, novel strains), Active Experimentation, In-Game Currency. 2.9.3. Narrative Milestones: Structural framework for progression. Guide through dev stages, unlock capabilities. Examples: Early (First Grow, Harvest/Sale, Basic Nutrients), Mid (Funding, Strain for Research, Master Grower Cert, Warehouse Permit), Late (Pioneer Genetic Line, Market Leader, Renowned Library, Innovator Award). Milestones unlock: Skill Tree sections/tiers, Research Projects, new maps (Residential->Warehouse), NPCs/factions/markets, one-time rewards (currency, genetics, blueprints, rep), shift contracts/research focus. 2.9.4. Equipment & Resource-Based Progression: Distinct from Skill Tree. Upgrade equip (lights, pumps), improve resource quality (water, air, electricity, genetics) via currency/research. Skill nodes make equip/resources available/manageable. Equip can have own upgrade paths. 2.9.5. Meta-Progression: Persistent elements across saves: Persistent Genetic Library (player-bred strains tied to account, usable new games); Starting Facility Choice (start new games in advanced facilities - e.g. Warehouse - after first completion); Persistent Reputation (affects NPC/future P2P). 2.9.6. Other Progression Types: Skill/Mastery-Based (natural player improvement; potential leaderboards); Time-Based/Engagement (daily/weekly challenges/rewards, seasonal content/cosmetics real-time tied); Player Agency/Choice-Driven (sandbox allows diverse paths).
2.10. Automation Systems: "Earned Automation" philosophy. Progressive tools/systems alleviate "Burden of Consistency" (manual optimal conditions at scale/accel. time). Desirable, empowering path to efficiency, scale, peak genetics; not punishment. Enabled by: Sensors (raw data for decisions/control; Tiers: Basic - standalone/manual, Intermediate - networked/simple controllers, Advanced - accurate, multi-functional, specialized: leaf temp, moisture probes, inline water, spore traps; real-time/logged data); Controllers (react to sensor data via IF-THEN logic; e.g., auto HVAC, auto irrigation); Workflow Management (Late-Game: zenith; manage large/complex facilities by automating repetitive tasks; very late-game). Frees player for strategic tasks (genetics, research, design, market). Player agency: identify "Pain Points", prioritize automation unlocks.
2.11. Environmental Storytelling: Limited traditional external (facilities in "white abyss"). Focus: within constraints, player-controlled spaces, abstracted interactions. Methods: Initial Player Spaces (Residential House wear/tear, "relics" -> humble beginnings); Unlockable Decoratives (some with lore: "Pioneer's Manual," breeder photo, vintage equip); Landrace Acquisition (narrative framing: Expeditions, Rep, Lore Discovery -> "Origin Dossiers" -> off-screen regions/history); Future Facility Types (Abandoned Outpost -> initial state, hazards, remnants); Ambient Cues (Subtle: Optional UI Radio/News Ticker - industry, science, world events -> living world; equip branding -> industrial ecosystem).
2.12. Subtle World-Building & Lore Delivery: Non-intrusive, diegetic; organic discovery. Methods: In-Game Comms (Email/Msg: Industry News, Sci Journal Excerpts, NPC Msgs, ADA Memos); Item Descriptions (equip, seeds, nutrients, decor: lore - manufacturer, tech history, landrace origin/culture); Research/Skill Tree Unlocks (text blurb on history, discovery, significance); Ambient Cues (News Ticker, Branding). Lore examples: Cannabis Industry State (post-legalization, mega-corps vs startups, regs); Sci/Tech Landscape (tech level, fictional institutions/geneticists); Cultural Context (in-world views on cannabis use); Historical Milestones (events shaping landscape: blight, "Great Legalization Accord," marker discovery).
3. Visual Style & User Interface (UI/UX) Critical gameplay asset. Aims: modern, clean, sophisticated, visually stunning, intuitive, functional. Goal: present complex data effectively without overwhelming; "dark mode" palette. 3.1. Aesthetics: Overall Goal: Present complex sim data accessibly, intuitively, meaningfully; data -> actionable insights. Panel/Button: Material Design-inspired (subtle depth, layering, soft shadows), clean look. Iconography: Abstract but recognizable, sophisticated line art; simple, clear, understandable; vibrant Accent Palette for standout/categorization. Data Visualization: CRITICAL FEATURE; displays (graphs, charts, readouts) exceptionally clear, easy to interpret, aesthetic, useful; clean lines, subtle gradients, logical Accent/Functional colors; visuals prioritized over text. Interactivity/Feedback: Subtle, smooth UI animations/transitions (hovers, clicks, panels) for responsive feel; quick, non-interruptive. Layout/Info Density: Clean, uncluttered, effective negative space; balance complex info with clarity (tabs, collapsible sections, tooltips, modals); avoid clutter. Typography: Clean, modern, readable; complements UI/data; precise, professional fonts (high-tech/sci themes); weights for hierarchy (Headers heavier, Body standard, UI Elements medium, Data Displays clarity). 3.2. View Hierarchy & Interaction: Hierarchical nav: strategic facility -> tactical room -> detailed plant. Lvl 1: Exterior Shell (minimalist, white abyss). Lvl 2: Blueprint View (strategic, Two Point/Cities: Skylines adapter; facility layout). Lvl 3: Room Interior View (1st/Close 3rd Person, "street view"; scan area). Lvl 4+: Detail Views (Bench, Hydro System, Plant; increasing visual/data granularity). Click plant/asset in "street view" -> detail UI panel or "Action Mode". 3.3. Data Display Details: Plant Detail UI: Evolves. Early: basic info (Strain Name, Age, Health Bar 1-10); blank fields hint unlocks (tooltips); Player Visual Log. Mid-Late: manual entries (timestamps), real-time sensor data; Tabs (Environment, Nutrition, Genetics, Health Log) for dense data. Manual Data Acq. UI: Tool selected, target asset; "Action Mode" -> tool-specific view (pH probe in substrate, thermometer reading); auto-logged with timestamp. Time Display UI: Clear communication vital. Persistent: in-game date/time, accel level. Contextual: projected real-world time for processes based on speed. Clickable time/date toggles game/real-world display (indicated); logs use in-game timestamps. 3.4. UI/UX Refinement: Iterative design/testing. Strategies: flexible tabs, collapsible sections, tooltips/popovers, modals, "drill-down" architecture. Prototyping/usability testing essential. Full UI modding unlikely; limited customization (widgets, presets) possible. 3.5. Rendering Style & Quality: Visually sophisticated, high-quality; slightly stylized but grounded. Detail/clean visuals emphasized, not photorealistic. LOD/Textures: High geo detail/texture res for core assets; fine equip details visible; LODs mandatory/aggressive (esp. plants/frequent assets); 3-4 LOD levels/asset. Material Def: High contrast, realistic interactions; perceived realism important; PBR used (AI texture assist). Lighting: Primarily soft/ambient; contextual harsher/functional. Post-FX/VFX: Elegant/appropriate (AO, Bloom, subtle DoF); not overused; matches graphical sophistication. AA: Good quality for smooth, clean edges ("clean" aesthetic). Perf. Strategy: Initial launch: visual quality/detail in constrained scope (ltd max facility size); ongoing opt./scaling post-launch; Poly budgets TBD (perf testing). 3.6. Environment Design: Internal focus. Progression: small predefined (house) -> large customizable (warehouses). Minimalist exterior ("white abyss/purgatory"). 3.7. Plant Visualization: Core Goal: Highest realism/biological accuracy. Primary visual output of GxE; "the thing". Detail: Extremely detailed (leaves, buds, trichomes, stems, medium, pests, pathogens, deficiencies/excesses) without jarring contrast. Trichome density/appearance key visual quality (resin, ripeness; reflects genetics/env: color spectrum clear, milky, amber; density). Dynamics: Visuals change/adapt over time based on sim data; basic -> advance with sim; balance consistency/procedural variation.
4. Technical Considerations 4.1. Game Engine: Unity Engine (high-fidelity, robust tools, community). All maps/levels one engine, shared physics/algorithms. 4.2. Core Simulation & Physics Models: Abstracted real-world physics for perf, not hyper-realism. HVAC/Airflow: Zone-based influence, not full CFD; periodic calcs (few in-game min), adjust with time accel; material properties (insulation) affect heat transfer. Irrigation/Fluid Dynamics: No detailed pipe physics; logical flow, resource distribution; pump rates spec-based, abstracted pressure loss; pipe diameter bottleneck; nutrient mix instant post-agitation; medium properties via simplified percolation model. Genetics Engine: Opposite physics; ltd foundational strains, near full complexity from start; rules/probabilities, vast player-bred variety; needs balance. 4.3. AI Tool Integration (Development): Assistive tech in hybrid human-AI workflow; humans direct, refine, optimize. Mandatory Manual Opt: ALL AI 3D assets human artist review/opt; raw AI 3D NOT game-ready (Retopology, UV Unwrapping/Correction, LOD Creation, Texture Bake/Refine); ensures perf targets, tech reqs, art style. Tool Usage: 2D (Concepts): Primary: Gemini Imagen; Secondary: Leonardo.Ai, Layer-ready exports; Meshy (decent, errors/cost); Sloyd (worst). 3D (Plants - Special Case): Custom AI-Assisted Procedural Gen system (game data driven); Rodin for PBR textures/base meshes; AI assists procedural texturing/base mesh libraries. AI Coding Assist: Cursor with TaskMaster MCP (code gen, compile, organize, test, debug). Workflow: Balanced AI Integration (Hybrid); Engine integration via direct import post-manual opt. Rigorous asset mngmt (name, folders, Git LFS), provenance tracking vital. Provenance Tracking: Mandatory for AI assets (metadata: tool/ver, prompts, seeds, date, artist names, human mods summary, licensing); stored spreadsheets/DBs; ensures legal/ethical, QC, reproducibility, debug artifacts. Prompting Consistency: "Prompting Guide"/library (art style aligned). Human Review Checkpoints: Mandatory lead sign-off (visual, tech, perf). Emerging Tech: NeRF, Gaussian Splatting monitored, not for launch (limitations). 4.4. Engine-Native Systems: Leverage engine capabilities (animation). Shaders/Materials: Maximize material editor for dynamic effects (growth viz, health/stress, GxE, utility flow, aging/wear). Particle Systems: Effects (drips, CO2 haze, smoke/vapor). UI Animation: Engine UI framework for responsive/engaging elements. 4.5. Asset Management & Style Consistency: Crucial. Strict naming, standardized folders, version control (Git LFS); AI asset provenance key. Consistent prompting, rigorous review against Visual Style Guide essential. 4.6. Game Analytics & Technology Monitoring: Analytics tools (Beta/Post-Launch) for anonymized, aggregated data (progression, economy, behavior, perf); informs balancing, future dev. Tech monitoring strategic (maturity, workflow impact, cost, license, perf, vision alignment before adoption).
5. Risk Mitigation Proactive identification/mitigation key. Complexity: Balancing deep systems with engagement/understandability. Strategies: Progressive Disclosure, Clear UI/UX, AI Advisor, Tutorials. Procedural Plant Gen Quality/Perf: Risk of diverse, high-quality, performant plants reflecting GxE. Mitigation: Modular/Artist-Controlled Procedural System (human artists base assets/rules, AI assists variety), Strict Perf Budgets (poly, draw calls, textures), Extensive Visual/Perf Testing. AI Asset Pipeline Integrity/Legal: Risk of immature tools, inconsistent style, legal/ethical issues, inefficient PBR. Mitigation: Mandatory Human Artist Opt/Oversight, Rigorous Provenance, Strategic/Selective AI use, Strict Style Guide adherence (human review), stay informed on Legal/Ethical Landscape. Scope Management: Rigorous MVP prioritization. Defer advanced systems (breeding, marketplace, automation, extraction, physics, multi-region, deep narrative). Phased dev: 0 (Pre-Prod/Proto), 1 (Vertical Slice), 2 (MVP Sprints), 3 (Alpha/Beta), 4 (MVP Launch), 5 (Post-MVP Expansions/Live Service). Re-eval/remove high-risk/low-benefit (AR).
6. Securing Realism Data & Knowledge Base Accurate, verifiable info crucial for authenticity, "Realism Bias". Process: Public-Domain Knowledge (peer-reviewed papers, uni pubs, horticultural texts, guides). Knowledge base ongoing review/refinement (testing, feedback, new science). Key validated info via in-game guides ("Plant Problems Guide"), ADA.
7. Monetization Hybrid Model: Buy-to-Play (B2P) base + Ethical Microtransactions. Base Game: One-time purchase, complete core. Microtransactions (Ethical & Non-P2W): Purely Cosmetics (skins, decor, UI themes), no gameplay impact. Extreme caution/balancing for Convenience/QoL: NO P2W, core loop disruption, competitive advantage, skipping progression, unobtainable resources. Player feedback paramount. Manual/earned automation always most effective/rewarding. Paid Expansions (Future Major Content): Substantial new content/features (New Maps/Regions, Genetic Pool Expansions, Sophisticated Physics, Wider Equip/Materials/Decor, Adv. Procedural Gen, Enhanced Data Tools, Complex Econ Systems, Refined Progression, Staff/Worker AI, Deep Narrative, Adv. Processing). Balancing Monetization & Player Experience: Fair, respects time/investment; transparency crucial. Monetized content substantial value; not artificial barriers/frustration. Continuous community dialogue. Marketplace Tax (future) for dev revenue/currency sink.
8. Conclusion Vision ambitious, achievable via disciplined, forward-thinking approach. Core concept: deep cannabis sim + genetics/breeding + construction + evolving economy; targets unique/underserved niche. Key strategies: Well-Defined MVP (core cultivation/genetics); Strategic AI Tool Integration (assistive, hybrid human-AI); Mandatory Human Oversight (artists control quality, opt, style); Rigorous Asset Mngmt (incl. AI provenance); Strategic Abstraction (simplify complex systems like physics); Leverage Engine-Native Capabilities (perf/stability); Continuous Learning & Data-Informed Dev (analytics, tech monitoring); Cohesive Narrative & UI (motivation, guidance, clear data, non-intrusive); "Earned Automation" (rewarding progression); Player-Controlled Time (pacing, risk/reward strategy). Structured approach -> strong launch, solid foundation for growth. Focus: mastering cultivation, breeding, industry leadership; contextualized by narrative, supported by deep systems.
