Technical & Systemic Implementation Design v1.1

I. Introduction Outlines technical strategies, systemic frameworks, development processes for Project Chimera's core features. Aim: detailed, engaging, performant, scalable, manageable simulation within development constraints. Involves: abstracted physics, AI-assisted asset creation with human oversight, rigorous technical standards. Balances deep simulation, visual quality, engaging gameplay.
II. Core Simulation & Physics Models Abstracted real-world physics for performance. A. Designing Abstracted/Simplified Physics Models HVAC/Airflow Dynamics: Approach: Zone-based influence model (per "Construction & Facility Management Design 1.1"), not full CFD. Mechanics:
● Environmental equipment (fans, ACs, heaters, dehumidifiers, heat-producing lights) project "fields of influence" (cones, spheres, defined zones).
● Parameters (temperature, humidity, CO2) modified gradually in fields by equipment power/settings.
● Air exchange between rooms/zones based on player-configured ventilation rates (intake/exhaust capacities) & simplified pressure differentials (e.g., sealed room with strong exhaust draws from connected, less pressurized spaces).
● Physical obstructions (walls, large equipment) dampen/block influence fields, creating microclimates.
● Construction material thermal properties (insulation R-value) affect inter-zone and exterior heat transfer. Performance: Parameters recalculated periodically (e.g., every few in-game minutes or on significant state changes like equipment on/off), not per frame. Frequency adjusts with active in-game time acceleration.
Irrigation/Fluid Dynamics: Approach: No detailed pipe fluid physics simulation. Focus: logical flow, resource distribution. Mechanics:
● Pump flow rates based on specs; diminishing returns for excessive outlets or long pipe runs (abstracted pressure loss).
● Pipe diameter can bottleneck if undersized main feeds multiple high-demand systems.
● Nutrient mixing in reservoirs: instantaneous, uniform post-ingredient addition and agitation (if agitator present/active).
● Growing medium saturation, water retention, drainage modeled on defined medium properties (e.g., coco coir: high water retention, good drainage; perlite: improves aeration/drainage). Involves simplified percolation model influencing watering frequency/leaching.
B. Determining Poly Budgets for 3D Models Establishment: Rigorous performance testing in chosen game engine (e.g., Unreal, Unity) with representative scenes (densely populated grow room: multiple plants, lights, fans, HVAC). Tiered Budgets:
● Hero Assets (advanced research equipment, "Mother Plants," key story objects): higher budget.
● Standard Equipment (grow lights, fans, pumps, pots, benches): medium budget.
● Environmental Props & Structural Elements (walls, floors, pipes, ducting, background props): lower budget.
● Plants (Dynamic & Procedural): specific budgets per growth stage, considering many instances. Crucial: efficient instancing, distant plant billboard techniques. Level of Detail (LODs): Mandatory, aggressive, well-optimized for all 3D assets, especially plants and frequently used equipment. Typically 3-4 LOD levels/asset. Target: Visual quality comparable to "Satisfactory" or "Farming Simulator" (per "Asset List 1.2"), smooth framerates on target hardware.
III. AI-Assisted Asset Creation & Pipeline Hybrid AI-human workflow: AI for efficiency, human artists maintain full control (quality, optimization, artistic direction). A. Implementing Mandatory Manual Optimization Workflow for AI Assets Context: AI tools (3D concept generation, texture synthesis) for initial ideation or base assets. Pipeline Stage: ALL game assets pass mandatory human artist optimization/refinement, regardless of initial generation method. Key Human Artist Steps:
● Retopology: Clean, game-ready low-poly mesh, optimized edge flow (for deformation/rendering) over AI concept or derived high-poly sculpt.
● UV Unwrapping & Correction: Professional, non-overlapping UV layout for efficient texturing, lightmap baking, avoiding artifacts. AI UVs usually insufficient, require re-work.
● LOD Creation: Manual creation of multiple, progressively simpler LODs.
● Texture Baking & Refinement: Bake high-poly/AI concept details (normal maps, AO) to optimized low-poly textures. Human artists refine textures, create PBR maps (albedo, metallic, roughness, AO), ensure art style consistency. Rationale: Ensures assets meet performance targets, technical requirements (clean UVs, rigging), adhere to visual style guide. Aligns with "Game Concept 1.3" (human expertise for quality, optimization, complex system implementation).
B. Designing the AI-Assisted Procedural Generation System for Plants Custom Framework: In-engine system for dynamic cannabis plant model creation. Driven by Game Data & Genetics: Visual morphology (height, branching, internode spacing, leaf size/shape/serration, bud structure, coloration) dynamically generated based on:
● Genetic Traits: Data from in-game genetics engine (ranges, probabilities for morphological characteristics).
● Growth Stage: Models for seedling, vegetative, flowering stages; dynamic bud development.
● Environmental Conditions (GxE Interaction): Visual responses to stress/conditions (e.g., light stretching if low PPFD, leaf discoloration from nutrient deficiencies, underwatering wilt).
● Player Actions: Visual changes from pruning, topping, LST, defoliation. AI Integration Points:
● Base Textures: AI-generated textures (leaf surfaces, bark, trichomes, pest/disease effects) as inputs/layers in procedural texturing.
● Base Mesh Libraries: AI tools may assist creating diverse base meshes (leaf shapes, bud formations, stem segments) for procedural system selection, combination, modification. Output: Game-ready, potentially animated (wind sway) plant models with LODs, optimized for many instances.
C. Designing the Workflow Strategy for Balanced AI Integration Essential: clearly defined hybrid workflow.
1. Define Need & Brief (Human): Designers/lead artists define asset requirements, functionality, style, technical constraints.
2. AI-Assisted Ideation/Base Generation (AI + Human): Artists may use AI (text-to-image for concepts, generative 3D for rough shapes/textures) for exploration/starting point. Provenance tracking begins.
3. Curation & Selection (Human): Artists review AI outputs, select promising candidates aligning with brief.
4. Iterative Development & Optimization (Human Core Loop): Primary stage. Human artists take selected AI output (or use as inspiration for fresh start) for: detailed 3D sculpting/modeling, rigorous retopology, professional UV unwrapping, texturing/material creation (AI textures heavily refined, layered, or replaced), LOD creation, rigging/animation (if applicable).
5. Engine Integration & Testing (Human): Finalized asset imported to engine, materials set up, tested for visual fidelity, performance, collision, gameplay functionality.
6. Review & Finalization (Human): Leads review asset against style guide, tech specs, performance benchmarks. Iterations if needed. Principle: AI is assistive tech for ideation/sub-tasks. Human artists/designers retain full control (creative process, final quality, optimization, game vision adherence), per "Game Concept 1.3".
IV. Engine-Native Systems & Asset Management Leverage engine capabilities, strict organization crucial. A. Implementing Engine-Native Animation Systems Shaders & Materials: Maximize engine's material editor/shader capabilities (Unreal Material Editor, Unity Shader Graph, custom HLSL/GLSL if essential):
● Plant Animation: Vertex animation in shaders (wind sway, growth, player interaction responses e.g., leaves brushed).
● Visual Effects (VFX): Environmental (heat haze near hot equipment, water droplets on leaves), dynamic material changes (leaf wilting, nutrient burn, desiccation). Particle Systems: Utilize engine's native systems for:
● Irrigation sprays/mists.
● Subtle atmospheric effects (dust motes in light beams).
● Pest activity visual feedback (fine webbing for spider mites), disease spread (abstract spore-like particles).
● Smoke/vapor from equipment. UI Animation: Engine's UI framework (UMG in Unreal, UI Toolkit in Unity) for responsive/engaging UI animations, transitions, dynamic feedback. Rationale: Engine-native systems: better performance, stability, compatibility, access to robust tools/documentation.
B. Implementing Asset Management & Style Consistency Naming Conventions: Strict, documented for all files, engine assets, folders, blueprints/prefabs, code variables (e.g., AssetType_SpecificName_Variant_LOD#_Version, BP_GameplaySystem_Name). Folder Structure: Standardized, logical hierarchy in project repository and engine content browser. Ensures easy find/manage, reduces conflicts. Version Control: Git for source code/project files; Git LFS for large binaries (textures, 3D models, audio). Clear branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow), regular commits. Provenance Tracking (Crucial for AI-Assisted Assets): Mandatory, per "Game Concept 1.3".
● Metadata Standard: For every asset (especially AI-touched):
○ AI Tool(s) & Version (e.g., Stable Diffusion XL v1.0, Midjourney v6, internal AI model).
○ Exact Text Prompts & Negative Prompts.
○ Seed numbers, key generation parameters (CFG scale, sampler, steps).
○ Date of AI generation.
○ Name(s) of Human Artist(s) who modified, optimized, curated.
○ Concise summary of human modifications (e.g., "Retopologized, UVs redone, texture color corrected, LODs created").
○ Licensing info for AI tool/model, if applicable.
● Method: Store metadata in shared spreadsheet, dedicated asset management database, or embedded in asset file descriptions.
● Purpose: Ensures legal/ethical compliance (AI model licenses, data sources), aids QC, allows reproducibility, helps debug AI artifacts, clear record of hybrid process. Prompting Consistency & Style Guide Adherence:
● Develop "Prompting Guide"/library of effective prompts aligned with Project Chimera art style if text-to-image/model AI used.
● All assets (AI-assisted or not) rigorously reviewed against Visual Style Guide. Human Review Checkpoints: Mandatory review stages in asset creation. Leads (artists, technical artists, art directors) sign off at key points (post-modeling, post-texturing, final engine integration) for visual, technical, performance compliance.
V. Game Analytics & Technology Monitoring Data-driven development, staying informed on tech advancements key for long-term success. A. Setting up Game Analytics Tools: Integrate suitable analytics platform (industry standards: Unity Analytics, PlayFab, Amplitude; or custom). Data Points for Collection (Anonymized & Aggregated during Beta & Post-Launch):
● Player Progression: Common Skill Tree paths, research choices, facility expansion rates, time to key milestones.
