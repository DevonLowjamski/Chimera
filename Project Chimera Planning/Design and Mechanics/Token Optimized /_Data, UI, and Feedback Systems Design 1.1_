I. Introduction
● Document: Design philosophy & implementation for Project Chimera's Data, User Interface (UI), and Feedback Systems.
● Purpose: Fundamental to player understanding, decision-making, engagement with complex cultivation, breeding, facility management.
● Core Philosophy: Transform intricate simulation data into intuitive, actionable insights, empowering players to observe patterns, learn from outcomes, optimize operations.
● UI Goal: Clean, functional, scalable for novices and veterans. Aligns with "Gameplay Mechanics 1.1" (UI/Data Viz as crucial).
II. Detailed Design of UI/Data Visualization Elements
● Employ various UI elements for accessible, meaningful data presentation.
● A. Environmental Data Dashboards/Overlays
○ Functionality: Real-time/summarized environmental data for selected grow rooms/zones. Crucial for at-a-glance status checks, immediate response.
○ Content:
■ Real-time sensor readouts: Temperature, Relative Humidity (RH), Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), CO2, light intensity (PPFD at canopy if sensors placed). Sourced from player-placed sensors ("Gameplay Mechanics 1.1").
■ Target vs. Actual Values: Clearly displayed for comparison.
■ Status Indicators: Color-coding (Sec VIII) or icons for optimal, warning, critical ranges.
○ Customization & Accessibility:
■ Player-selectable data points for main dashboard or contextual room overlay.
■ Savable custom dashboard presets (e.g., "Vegetative Stage Overview," "Flower Room - Late Stage Criticals," "Drying Room Status").
■ Display: Non-intrusive overlay (toggleable) or dedicated "Facility Overview" screen.
○ Visual Style: Clean, legible fonts; digital-style readouts; minimalist.
● B. Graphs & Charts
○ Functionality: Visualize historical data trends, multi-variable relationships for learning/optimization.
○ Types & Features:
■ Historical Trend Graphs: Line graphs for environmental parameters (temp, RH, VPD, CO2), nutrient solution data (EC, pH in reservoirs), plant growth metrics (height, est. biomass increase), resource consumption over player-defined periods (24h, 7d, grow cycle). cite_start.
■ Multi-Variable Plots (Advanced): Scatter plots (e.g., VPD vs. simulated transpiration rate); potential parallel coordinate plots.
■ Comparison Tools: Overlay trend graphs (diff. cycles, same strain/room); side-by-side charts (diff. strains/rooms, same period).
○ Interface: Interactive charts (hover for values/timestamps, zoom, toggle series).
● C. Plant Health/Status Indicators & Dedicated Plant Detail View UI
○ At-a-Glance Indicators: Visual icons/health bars above individual plants (zoomed) or group/bench summaries. Quick assessment (e.g., leaf icon green->yellow->red; segmented health bar). Aligns with "Overall Health Status Bar" ("Core Gameplay Loop 1.1").
○ Plant Detail View UI (on plant selection):
■ Basic Info: Strain Name, Plant ID, Age, Growth Stage.
■ Environmental Snapshot: Current readings affecting plant (canopy temp, local humidity from sensors/microclimate sim).
■ Nutrient Status: Qualitative (e.g., "Optimal," "Minor Nitrogen Deficiency"). Derived from visual cues, player logs, sim. leaf/medium analysis.
■ Watering Status: Medium moisture (VWC%), time since last water, indicators ("Needs Water").
■ Health Issues Log: Active/recent problems (e.g., "Pest: Spider Mites - Low," "Powdery Mildew - Treated"). Links to "Plant Problems Guide."
■ Genetic Summary: Key traits (dominant/recessive markers), parentage.
■ Individual Plant Log/Notes.
■ Yield Prediction (Flowering): Rough, dynamic estimate (health, size, genetics; if model feasible).
● D. Resource Consumption UI & Bulk Storage Visualization
○ Resource Overview Panel:
■ Icons for consumables: Water (Tap, RO, Treated), Power (grid/generator), Nutrients (type/mixed), CO2 (tank levels). Sourced: "Asset List 1.2."
■ Displays stock levels (liters, kWh, kg); current/avg. consumption rates (L/hr, kWh/day).
○ Bulk Storage Models: Visuals of containers (tanks, totes, cylinders) dynamically reflect fill levels (e.g., translucent tank water level).
○ Utility Usage Dashboard:
■ Breakdown: Power (by room, equip category, individual high-draw appliances - advanced); Water usage.
■ Cost calculations over periods.
III. Specifics of Data Collection & Analysis Tools
● Tools for active data gathering, management, interpretation.
● A. Sensor & Controller Management Interface
○ Functionality: Centralized UI for all sensors/controllers.
○ Features: Visual sensor placement; sensor naming/labeling; calibration routine (if drift mechanic); sensor status indicators (Online, Offline, Low Battery, Needs Cal.); link sensors to controllers & define logic (IF-THEN).
● B. Grow Cycle Comparator Tool
○ Functionality: Side-by-side analysis of grow cycles for learning/optimization.
○ Interface: Player selects ≥2 cycles. Dashboard compares KPIs: Yield (Total, /Plant, /Watt/SqFt); Quality Metrics (cannabinoid/terpene profiles); Resource Costs; Cycle Duration; Health problem incidence. Overlay historical trend graphs. Highlights significant differences.
● C. Simulated "Lab Analysis" Interface
○ Functionality: Access (simulated) advanced testing.
○ Interface: Player "submits" samples (leaf, bud, soil/medium). Shows queue, processing time, costs. Results via "Lab Report": values (NPK, THC/CBD %); comparison to optimal/previous. Data populates fields. Aligns: "Gameplay Mechanics 1.1" ("Advanced Analysis - Future?").
IV. Logs & Notes System
● Player observations & auto key event logging.
● Player-Driven Logging: "Grower's Journal."
○ Features: Assign notes (plants, batches, rooms, equip, general ops); Tagging (keywords: "deficiency," "pest_sighting") for search/filter; Rich text; Conceptual screenshot attachment.
● Automated Event Logging: Timestamps ("Time Mechanic 1.1").
○ Events: Planting, transplanting, harvest dates; Environmental alerts; Nutrient solution changes; Significant player actions (IPM, light cycle changes); Research, construction, breeding project completion.
● Interface: Central, searchable, filterable logbook (by date, ID, room, event, tags).
V. Refining Alerts & Notifications
● Prompt, clear critical issue info.
● Categories & Triggers:
○ Environmental Criticals: Sustained setpoint deviation threatening health.
○ Equipment Malfunctions: Failures (pump, light, fan), HVAC faults, controller offline.
○ Resource Depletion Warnings: Critical low water, nutrients, CO2, fuel.
○ Plant Health Emergencies: Severe pests, widespread disease, acute toxicity/deficiency.
○ Operational Alerts: Deadlines, research/construction complete, genetics unlocked.
○ Process Flow Issues: Drying room full, curing needs attention.
● Presentation & Prioritization:
○ Visual: Non-Modal Pop-ups (warnings, info); Modal Alerts (critical, needs acknowledgement); Flashing Icons/Indicators (on entity/dashboard); Persistent Alert List/Ticker (scrollable, color-coded).
○ Audio: Optional, distinct cues by severity (chime, beep, alarm). Customizable.
● Actionability: Alerts state: problem nature; location/entity; severity/urgency. Ideally, direct links to UI/tools.
VI. Applying Data Visualization Best Practices
● Intuitive, actionable, aesthetic data presentation.
● Clarity & Simplicity: Readability, clean lines, negative space, avoid "chart junk," high data-ink ratio.
● Consistency: Colors, icons, typography, interactions. Reduces cognitive load.
● Visual Hierarchy: Most important info prominent (size, color, placement). Critical alerts demand attention.
● Contextual Info & Guidance: Extensive on-hover Tooltips (labels, icons, terms, ranges, calcs); Integrated Help/Tutorials linked from charts/views.
● Interactivity: Hover for precise chart values; Drill-down capabilities; Robust filtering/sorting.
● Accessibility: Color-blind friendly palettes; scalable/legible text.
● Avoid Info Overload: Progressive disclosure (summaries to details); Tabs, collapsible sections, modals for organization.
VII. Designing Workflow & Facility Layout Optimization Tools (Advanced/Late-Game)
● Tools for physical/operational facility efficiency analysis/improvement at scale.
● Visual Analysis Overlays (Toggleable):
○ Material Flow Visualization (Abstracted): Paths/bottlenecks for water/nutrients, plant movement, harvested material, waste.
○ Environmental Heat Maps ("Construction & Facility Management Design 1.1"): Temp, humidity, airflow, light distribution; identify inconsistencies, dead spots. Relies on Abstracted Microclimate Modeling.
○ Utility Load Visualization: Electrical/plumbing load overlays; highlight overloads/insufficient capacity.
● "Layout Simulation" Mode (Very Advanced):
○ Sandboxed planning: Virtually rearrange equipment, walls, utilities.
○ Simulated projection of impacts (airflow, temp, material flow, costs) before actual changes.
VIII. Decision on Alerts/Rewards Color Use & Palette Application
● Context: "Visual Style Guide" palette (Teal, Orange, Purple, Gold, Green).
● Recommended Hybrid Approach:
○ General UI & Positive/Neutral: Existing accent palette.
■ Green (Accent): "Optimal," completion, "System Online," "Healthy."
■ Teal/Purple (Accent): Standard interactive elements, info displays, selected states.
■ Gold/Orange (Accent): "Reward" notifications, important non-critical info needing moderate attention.
○ Dedicated Alert Colors (Distinct):
■ Bright Red: Exclusively CRITICAL, immediate-attention alerts (crop loss, fire). Used sparingly.
■ Bright Yellow/Amber: WARNINGS - serious, timely attention, not catastrophic (low resources, early pest). Palette Orange if distinct, else dedicated yellow/amber.
● Rationale: Maintains accent palette integrity; critical/warning alerts have immediate, understood prominence.
IX. Refining UI Layout & Information Density (Iterative)
● Balance comprehensive data vs. clean UI via iterative design/testing.
● Key UI Organization Strategies:
○ Flexible Tab Systems (e.g., Room Detail: Overview, Controls, Plants, Tasks, Log).
○ Collapsible Sections/Accordions (summary default, expandable details).
○ Contextual Tooltips & Popovers (on-hover for icons/labels; popovers for mini-guides).
○ Modal Windows (focused tasks, critical info acknowledgement).
○ "Drill-Down" Architecture (high-level to granular).
● Prototyping & Usability Testing:
○ Interactive prototypes (low-to-high fidelity).
○ Usability testing with players throughout development (pain points, clarity, layout/flow feedback). Essential.
● Customization (Limited Flexibility):
○ Full UI modding likely out of scope. Minor customizations: dashboard widgets, list reordering, filter presets.
X. Conclusion
● Data, UI, Feedback Systems: Player's lens on Project Chimera's world.
● Commitment to clarity, intuitiveness, actionable insights, iterative design (best practices, player feedback) supports core loop (observation, learning, optimization).
● Empowers players: navigate depth, make informed decisions, achieve mastery in virtual cultivation/breeding.
