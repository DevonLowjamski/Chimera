Cultivation Systems & Automation Design 1.1
I. Introduction Design for Project Chimera's cultivation systems and progressive automation. Core philosophies: realistic simulation, critical Genotype x Environment (GxE) interaction, robust player agency in experimentation/decision-making, rewarding progression from manual tasks to "Earned Automation". Aim: engaging cycle where detailed management/optimization leads to tangible cultivation/facility efficiency improvements at player-controlled pace.
II. Plant-Specific Environmental "Recipes" & Profiling Dynamic GxE interplay is central. Players discover/utilize unique plant environmental needs.
A. Defining Environmental "Recipes"
* Concept: Each distinct cannabis strain/notable phenotype has a unique optimal "recipe". Consists of ideal ranges for temperature, humidity, Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), light spectrum/intensity (PPFD), CO2, specific nutrient parameters (EC targets, NPK ratios) per growth stage.
* Strain Variation & Genetic Influence:
   * Landrace Strains: May have wider optimal environmental ranges (greater resilience/adaptability), possibly lower peak genetic potential if not fine-tuned. "Recipe" more forgiving for novices.
   * Hybrids & Inbred Lines (IBLs): Breeding/stabilization may result in narrower, specific optimal environmental windows. Achieving precise conditions can unlock highest genetic potential (quality, yield, cannabinoid/terpene profiles).
* "Environmental Tolerance" Trait: Plant's inherent genetic trait directly influences optimal range breadth. High tolerance = wider, forgiving recipe; low tolerance = meticulous control.
* Growth Stage Dynamics: "Recipe" is not static, adapts through lifecycle:

   * Seedling/Clone: Higher humidity, lower light intensity.
   * Vegetative: Moderate humidity, strong blue-spectrum light, higher nitrogen.
   * Flowering (Early to Late): Lower humidity (especially late flower for mold prevention), intense red-spectrum light, higher phosphorus/potassium, specific VPD targets for transpiration/bud development.
   * Data Representation: Discovered "recipes" stored/accessed via:
   * In-game "Strain Database" or "Grower's Journal" UI (strain/phenotype specific).
   * Visuals (e.g., ideal ranges on graphs in Plant Detail UI for selected strain).
B. "Environmental Profiling" Mechanic Players discover "recipes" via active experimentation, data analysis, learning.
   * Discovery Process:
   * Initial State: New/unprofiled strain's optimal "recipe" is unknown (broad estimates or hidden).
   * Experimentation: Players design experiments with controlled parameters (grow rooms/individual plants). May involve A/B testing on clones under varied conditions.
   * Data Collection: Meticulous use of data tools:
   * Environmental Data: Real-time sensor readings (temp, humidity, CO2, PAR/PPFD).
   * Growing Medium Data: Manual sampling (EC/PPM, pH, temp, Volumetric Water Content - VWC).
   * Plant Responses: Observation (growth rates, health indicators like leaf color/turgidity/stress signals), nutrient uptake (EC drop in hydroponics), post-harvest data (yield, simulated lab analysis of cannabinoids/terpenes).
   * Feedback Loop: Clear, consistent game feedback. Deviation from hidden optimum causes graduated negative responses (subtle stress, reduced growth, lower quality/yield). Adjusting closer to ideal improves outcomes.
   * "Science" Skill Tree Integration: Progression vital for effective profiling. Nodes ("Observation & Record Keeping", "Data Interpretation & Diagnostics", "Advanced Analytics & Research Methodology") enhance experiment design, data collection, result interpretation. Higher skills may unlock advanced UI tools for visualizing optimal ranges (e.g., dynamic graph shading "optimal" zones from logged data).
   * UI for Profiling:
   * Dedicated "Research Log" or advanced Plant Detail UI tab for recording experimental parameters/outcomes.
   * Interface for side-by-side comparison of grow cycles/batches for same strain.
   * Ability to "save" profiled strain's optimal recipe. Saved recipe usable for advanced automation or AI assistants.
III. Automation Systems Design "Earned Automation" philosophy: players progressively gain tools/systems alleviating "Burden of Consistency" (manual cultivation at scale/accelerated time).
A. Sensors Provide raw data for decisions/control.
   * Types & Tiers:
   * Basic Sensors: Standalone digital units, manual checking (e.g., basic thermometer/hygrometer).
   * Intermediate Sensors: Networked, transmit to central display or simple controllers for consistent monitoring.
   * Advanced Sensors: Highly accurate, multi-functional (e.g., temp, RH, VPD, CO2). Includes specialized: leaf surface temp sensors, continuously-logging soil/medium moisture probes, inline water sensors (pH/EC/temp), simulated air particle/spore traps (very advanced "Science" unlock).
   * Functionality: Real-time/logged data for player understanding, decision-making, automated controller operation.
   * Placement Mechanics:
   * Grid-based (walls, stands, in environment).
   * Ambient sensors (air temp, RH, CO2) have "radius of accuracy" / "zone of influence" (encourages multiple sensors for microclimate mapping). Ties to Abstracted Microclimate Modeling.
   * Placement is minor skill element; suboptimal placement (sensor near hot light) gives skewed readings.
   * Progression & Unlocks: Availability, accuracy, types tied to player progression via "Science" skill tree (accuracy, new capabilities like VPD) and "Environment" skill tree (climate monitoring tools).
B. Controllers Interpret sensor data, actuate equipment per player logic.
   * Progression & Types:
   * Simple Timers: Basic on/off scheduling (lighting).
   * Basic Controllers (Thermostats, Humidistats): On/off control via single sensor/setpoint (e.g., AC on if temp > X). Unlocked via "Environmental Automation (Sensors & Controllers - Basic)" node ("Environment" skill tree).
   * Intermediate Controllers (Abstracted PLCs): Multiple sensor inputs, control multiple equipment with simple conditional logic (e.g., IF temp > X AND lights = ON, THEN increase exhaust fan to Y%). Part of "Precision Climate Management" node.
   * Advanced Controllers (Central Computer System / Advanced PLCs): Pinnacle control. Manage multiple zones, integrate diverse sensors/equipment, execute complex multi-step schedules from player "recipes," potential advanced data logging/analysis. Very late-game unlock; tied to "Precision Climate Management," possibly high-tier "Construction" skills.
   * Logic & Linking User Interface (UI):
   * Intuitive UI for automation configuration (dedicated "Automation" screen or enhanced "Utility View").
   * Visual linking of sensors to controllers, controllers to equipment (drag-and-drop or node graph).
   * UI for defining setpoints, ranges, conditional logic (IF-THEN-ELSE, time-based conditions).
C. Scheduled Events (Beyond Basic Light & Fertigation) Advanced controllers automate nuanced cultivation aspects.
   * Preventative Integrated Pest Management (IPM):
   * Schedule automated periodic releases of beneficial insects (if consumable asset) or automated organic pesticide/fungicide application via integrated spraying systems.
   * Unlocked with advanced IPM nodes ("Cultivation" skill tree).
   * Considerations: Automated spraying needs specific equipment (fixed nozzles), carries risks if misconfigured (too close to harvest, plant stress if application environment suboptimal).
   * Dynamic Environmental Adjustments:
   * Schedule gradual/stepped environmental parameter changes (temp, humidity) at specific times/weeks (e.g., diurnal temp variations, lowering humidity in late flower).
   * Tied to "Precision Climate Management".
   * Automated System Maintenance Cycles:
   * Hydroponics: schedule periodic nutrient solution flushes, automated reservoir top-offs/changes.
   * Programming Interface: Complex schedules programmed via advanced controller UIs.
D. Alerts & Notifications System Critical for informing player of issues (large facilities, automation during accelerated/offline time).
   * Detection & Progression:
   * Early Game: Relies on direct player observation, basic environmental readouts.
   * Mid-Late Game: Advanced sensors assist early problem detection, augmenting player skill.
   * Advanced Sensor-Based Detection Examples:
   * Simulated Spore Traps / Air Particle Sensors: Very late-game "Science" or "Advanced IPM" unlock. Trigger alerts like "Warning: Unusually high airborne particulate/spore levels detected... Microscopic inspection recommended." (not definitive identification).
   * Simulated Canopy Monitoring Sensors (advanced thermal/spectral imaging): Extremely high-tier. Detect subtle widespread changes (leaf temp, spectral reflectance) indicating early systemic stress, deficiency, or disease before visually apparent. Alert: "Informational: Anomalous leaf surface temperature patterns detected... Monitor plants closely..."
   * Automated EC/pH Fluctuation Alerts: Drastic, unexpected hydroponic reservoir EC/pH shifts (outside programmed parameters) indicate nutrient depletion, salt buildup, or root problems.
   * Alert System Design:
   * Tiered Alerts: Differentiate by severity (Blue/Informational, Yellow/Warning, Red/Critical).
   * Logging: All alerts logged with timestamps in facility event log.
   * Actionable Information: Provide context, direct to relevant UI/location (e.g., "Critical Alert: Pump P-05 Failure... [Go to Utility View] [Go to Equipment Location]").
   * Customization: Player might customize notification preferences per severity.
IV. Buffers, Redundancy, and Risk Management Paramount as operations scale and with time acceleration; minor issues can escalate.
   * A. Backup Power Systems:
   * Generators: Diesel/Gas, require fuel. Auto-activate on grid failure. Limited output capacity forces strategic decisions on essential system connections.
   * Tiers: Basic (louder, less efficient, manual prime/start early game) to advanced (quieter, efficient, auto transfer switches).
   * Battery Banks / UPS: Short-term power buffer for critical systems during outages or generator switchover. Essential for sensitive electronics/data logging.
   * B. Redundant Water Pumps:
   * Players can design plumbing redundancy. "Dual Pump Manifold" could be higher-tier researchable equipment.
   * Mechanics: If one pump fails (MTBF mechanic), secondary auto takes over. System alerts on initial pump failure.
   * C. Water & Nutrient Reservoirs as Buffers:
   * Strategic use of larger reservoirs buffers against frequent manual refilling. Crucial for accelerated time scales.
   * D. Equipment Malfunction & Environmental Issue Alerts:
   * Cornerstone of proactive risk management. Alert system flags:
   * Equipment Failures: Pump seizures, fan burnouts, light ballast/driver failures, empty CO2 tanks, critical reservoir lows, tripped breakers.
   * Environmental Deviations: Critical parameters significantly out of player-defined optimal range despite automation (e.g., AC on, temp still rising).
   * Vital for facility status feedback, especially after offline progression.
   * E. Time Acceleration "Transition Inertia" System:
   * Existing system is key risk management. Encourages deliberate decisions, prevents trivially escaping consequences of poor planning/failures at high speeds.
V. Workflow Management (Late-Game Automation) Zenith of "Earned Automation," managing larger/complex facilities by automating repetitive, labor-intensive tasks. Typically very late-game unlocks.
   * A. Automated Potting & Transplanting:
   * Equipment: Robotic potting machines, soil/medium dispensers, pot conveyor systems.
   * Mechanics: Player configures "recipe" (pot size, medium type, plant stage). Requires designated input (supplies) and output (potted plants) zones.
   * Progression: Very high-tier "Construction" (infrastructure) and "Cultivation" (horticultural understanding) skill tree nodes.
   * B. Automated Harvesting & Trimming:
   * Equipment: Automated trimming machines (existing asset). Could expand with robotic arms (plant cutting/movement), conveyors (feed trimmers, move product to drying).
   * Mechanics: Player designates harvest-ready plants/zones. Trimming machines have adjustable settings (aggressiveness), impacting speed vs. quality (trade-off).
   * Progression: High-tier "Harvest" skill tree nodes (e.g., "Post-Harvest Efficiency (Bulk Processing & Basic Auto.)").
   * C. Automated Plant Movement:
   * Equipment: Conveyor belts between rooms, robotic platforms, overhead gantry systems (move pots/trays).
   * Mechanics: Efficiently move large plant quantities between growth stages/rooms (propagation -> veg -> flower -> drying). Requires significant upfront facility design/investment.
   * Progression: Very late-game "Construction" nodes ("Specialized Facility Development") or dedicated high-tier "Logistics & Material Handling" node if very complex.
   * D. Integration with Player Progression & Facility Design:
   * Advanced workflow automation should be significant, aspirational achievements. Ultimate solutions to "Burden of Consistency" at massive industrial scale.
   * Implementation often requires players to design facilities for automation from outset (specific layouts, wide corridors, dedicated utility pathways).
