Gameplay Loops & Player Motivation 1.1
Document Purpose: Defines Project Chimera's: minute-to-minute & hour-to-hour gameplay loops, time mechanics, player progression (Skill Tree focus), motivational principles.
Overall Philosophy: Project Chimera: engaging, rewarding cannabis cultivation simulation. Core experience: player observation, experimental learning, strong progression sense. Early gameplay: manual interaction builds appreciation for later automation & advanced analytical tools. Design creates cycle: detailed management/optimization -> tangible cultivation/facility improvements; player-controlled pace; intrinsic/extrinsic motivators (Self-Determination Theory: Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness).
A. Core Gameplay Loop: Minute-to-Minute Interactions & Systems Time Mechanic Integration: Minute-to-minute loops use flexible, player-controlled time system ("Project Chimera: Time Mechanic - DRAFT v1.1"). Active in-game time scale impacts: plant visual change rate, manual intervention frequency, environmental condition drift/response speed, real-world outcome observation duration. In-game timestamps: crucial for all logged data.
Navigation & View Modes: Navigation: Hierarchical Zoom; Facility view (strategic) to section/room "street view" (tactical). Asset Focus: Click plant/equipment -> "Action Mode" or detailed UI panel.
Core Minute-to-Minute Interaction Loops:
* Plant Observation & Status Check Loop: Scan area -> Navigate to plant -> Visual inspection (correlates to simulated health) -> Click for "Plant Detail UI."

   * Plant Detail UI (Evolves with Progression):
   * Initial UI: Strain Name, Plant Age (in-game clock progression), Overall Health Status Bar (game-determined, visually correlated), Player Visual Observation Log.
   * Blank fields for advanced data; tooltips hint unlock requirements.
   * Advanced UI: Populates with manual tool readings (in-game timestamps) & real-time sensor data.
   * Tabs for clarity (Environment, Nutrition, Genetics, etc.).
   * Manual Data Acquisition Loop (Tool-Based): Identify need -> Select inventory tool (cursor change, tool visible) -> Click target asset (plant, substrate, room for ambient) -> Enter "Action Mode" (tool-specific view: e.g., pH meter in substrate, thermometer shows local ambient temp). Observe animated tool readout -> Data auto-logged (in-game timestamp) -> Exit Action Mode.
   * Manual Plant Work Loop (e.g., Pruning): Identify need -> Select tool (e.g., shears) -> Click target plant -> Enter "Action Mode" (e.g., plant structure view, targetable highlighted parts). Perform action (click cut) -> Visual/audio feedback, plant model updates -> Exit Action Mode.
   * Manual Environmental Adjustment Loop (Early Game): Observe env data -> Navigate to basic device (fan, vent) -> Click device -> Enter "Action Mode" (device control UI). Adjust setting -> Observe device animation/UI feedback -> Later observe env/plant impact.
Core Principles for Minute-to-Minute Interactions: Visual feedback primary, reflects underlying simulation. Learning by doing; player-controlled time. Direct player agency: tools, basic equipment. Data: progressively richer resource. Consistent interaction flow: select tool -> select target -> action mode. No distracting on-plant issue indicators (Early Game): Players use direct observation, interpret visuals/basic data; fosters "earned insight" for later diagnostic tools/sensors.
B. Core Gameplay Loop: Hour-to-Hour Session Structure & Systems Time Mechanic Integration: Real-world duration of in-game processes (plant growth, research, contracts) set by player's active time scale. Resource consumption rates (real-time) & task urgency scale with game speed. Players choose offline time progression speed (paused to active rates) at session end; outcomes reviewed via "Catch-Up Visualization" & "Facility Status Report" on login.
Session Goals & Objectives: Explicit, story-influenced objectives: Via dedicated UI ("Contracts," "Projects"); narratively contextualized to guide/teach. Time-Sensitivity: Objectives may have in-game deadlines; real-world urgency depends on active time scale. Achievable Scope: Significant progress/completion in 1-2 hour session.
Player Progression Systems (Primary Driver: Skill Tree - "Trees"):
   * Skill Point Acquisition: Main Source: Completing objectives/tasks/challenges. Secondary Source: Successful harvests (quality/outcome-based reward).
   * Skill Tree ("Trees") Visual Metaphor: Cannabis plant; 7 primary "Leaves" (categories) of varying size/prominence reflect importance. Leaves unfurl showing "Nodes" (skills/concepts); plant visually grows/vibrancy increases with progression.
   * Node Unlocking Philosophy: Node unlock: introduces core concept & associated game mechanics/simulations. Mastery/efficiency of concept via separate equipment/tool progression (purchased, researched, crafted).
   * Skill Tree Categories & Node Counts (Revised Draft v1.1):
   * Genetics (8-12 Nodes): Seed/Clone Fundamentals, Sexual Repro Basics, Phenotype Scouting, Adv. Vegetative Propagation, Pollen Mngmt, Trait Stabilization (Backcrossing), Targeted Repro (Feminization/Autoflower), Adv. Propagation (Tissue Culture), Understand Polygenic Traits, (Late Game) Genetic Marker Assisted Selection.
   * Cultivation (6-8 Nodes): Foundational Plant Care, Growing Media/Containers, Plant Structuring (Pruning/LST), IPM Fundamentals, Optimized Nutrient Delivery (Solution Crafting/Basic Hydro), Adv. Plant Shaping (HST/Canopy Mngmt), Atmospheric Opt. for Cultivation (VPD/CO2).
   * Environment (6-8 Nodes): Core Env. Parameters (Temp/Humidity/Light Cycle), Air Exchange/Circulation, Climate Control (Heating/Cooling Basics), Atm. Refinement (Humidification/Dehumidification), Adv. Lighting Solutions, Env. Automation (Basic Sensors/Controllers), Precision Climate Mngmt (Integrated HVAC/Adv. Automation).
   * Construction (4-6 Nodes): Basic Infrastructure (Tents/Power Strips), Room Structuring/Layout, Utility Fundamentals (Elec. Circuits/Manual Water Lines), Auto. Utilities Install (Plumbing/Adv. Elec.), Specialized Facility Dev. (Sealed Rooms/Workflow Opt.).
   * Harvest (4-6 Nodes): Harvest Readiness/Techniques, Controlled Drying, Trimming/Preparation, Curing Sci. & App., Post-Harvest Efficiency (Bulk Processing/Basic Auto.).
   * Science (4-6 Nodes): Observation/Record Keeping, Manual Env./Plant Sampling, Data Interpretation/Diagnostics, Quant. Analysis (Basic Lab Testing), Adv. Analytics & Research Methodology.
   * Business (3-4 Nodes): Basic Ops Mngmt (Contracts/Simple Finances), Brand/Reputation Building, Market Awareness/Product Specialization, (Opt. for Player Market) Adv. Economic Ops.
   * Skill Tree Interdependencies: Logical prerequisites between nodes in different categories ("Skill Tree Interdependency Map"); encourages broader development. UI contextually shows dependencies (highlights, tooltips).
"Ability vs. Challenge" Dynamic: Unlocked skill node: grants new abilities/mechanics access; also introduces new complexities/management considerations; ensures balanced progression.
Equipment & Resource-Based Progression: Distinct from skill tree: players upgrade equip. (lights, pumps) & improve resource quality (water, air) via currency/research; enhances management of skill tree unlocked concepts.
Narrative & World-Based Progression: Light narrative: guides players, contextualizes objectives, can gate progression to larger facilities (e.g., house to warehouse).
Unlockable Content & Feature Progression: Major new areas (e.g., warehouse map) or game systems unlocked via narrative/objective completion.
Meta-Progression: Persistent Genetic Library: Player-bred strains (player account tied), usable across saves. Starting Facility Choice: Start new games in advanced facilities (e.g., warehouse) post-initial completion. Persistent Reputation (Company/User): Affects NPC interactions (prices, contracts), P2P trading (trust, value). Influenced by product quality, ethical market behavior.
Skill and Mastery-Based Progression: Natural player improvement via practice, understanding, experimentation. Potentially reflected in online leaderboards.
Time-Based and Engagement Progression: Daily/weekly challenges/rewards; seasonal content/cosmetic drops (real-world time tied).
Player Agency and Choice-Driven Progression: Core sandbox philosophy: allows diverse paths/solutions.
Rewards for Progression: Rewards: In-game currency, Research Points, Blueprints, Reputation. (Genetics: primarily self-bred, traded, or special events; not direct quest rewards).
Core Activities within an Hour-to-Hour Session: Facility Expansion & Build-Out (physical construction, infrastructure). System Opt. & Experimentation (refining setups, testing techniques). Resource Mngmt (inventory, purchasing, planning).
Session Flow & Sense of Accomplishment: Login & Assess: Review status, objectives, offline progress. Execute Routines: Perform minute-to-minute tasks. Work Towards Session Goal(s): Contracts, research, build projects, experiments. Progression & Unlocks: Claim rewards, make upgrade choices. Implement Upgrades & Optimize: Integrate new capabilities. Prepare for Session End: Ensure facility stability, choose offline time progression mode. Satisfaction from: goal completion, unlocks, visible improvements, facility stability, harvest/future progress anticipation.
C. Balancing Manual Tasks vs. Automation ("Earned Automation") Realism First: Manual tasks mirror real-world small-scale effort. Diligent players can succeed manually. "Burden of Consistency" Drives Automation: Primary challenge: maintaining manual precision/consistency, esp. with scale/accelerated time. This burden makes automation desirable. Graduated & Realistic Consequences: Suboptimal conditions (manual error/poor automation) -> realistic, graduated impacts; not instant catastrophic failure for minor issues. Peak genetic potential requires near-perfect conditions. Player Agency in Identifying Pain Points: Players automate most challenging/time-consuming tasks. Automation Enhances Capability: Improves: consistency, efficiency, scalability, risk mitigation; frees player time. Designing "Initial Tedium Threshold": "Tedium" from cognitive load/time for consistent manual excellence, not artificial difficulty. Manual Watering/Nutrients/Env./Pest Scouting/Record Keeping: natural inconsistencies/time demands more apparent with scale/speed. Clear Path to & Benefits of Automation: Skill Tree & equip. progression clearly present automation solutions. Early automation: significant, immediate QoL improvements.
D. Communicating Time & Gameplay Information (UI/UX) Persistent Time Display: Shows current in-game date/time & active time acceleration level/description. Contextual Time Info: Plant growth UI, research/construction queues, contract timers show estimates: in-game time & real-world time (current speed). Toggleable Time Display Format (Global): Click main clock/time display to switch relevant UI: "In-Game Time" <> "Est. Real-World Time (current speed)". Clear visual indicator shows active mode. Historical Logs & Timestamps: Primarily in-game date/time (consistency); optional real-world session metadata.
E. Application of Player Motivation Theories (Self-Determination Theory - SDT) Autonomy: Supported by player choice in Skill Tree progression, equip. upgrades, facility design, breeding paths, problem-solving, offline time mngmt. Competence: Built by mastering Skill Tree nodes, successful equip. upgrade/use, high-quality harvests, overcoming new mechanic challenges, building strong reputation, (optional) leaderboards/challenges performance. "Ability vs. Challenge" dynamic central to competence. Relatedness: Fostered by (future) player-driven marketplace (trust, trade reputation), online leaderboards (shared goals, comparison), potentially well-developed NPC interaction or in-game "scientific community" contribution.
