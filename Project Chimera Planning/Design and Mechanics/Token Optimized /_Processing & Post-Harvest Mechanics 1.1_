Processing & Post-Harvest Mechanics v1.1
I. Introduction Project Chimera: Multi-stage processing & post-harvest systems design. Systems transform harvested cannabis to high-quality, marketable products, realizing player-cultivated genetic potential. Core philosophies: process realism, player agency via optimization choices, clear manual-to-automated progression, significant impact on final product attributes (potency, aroma, flavor, appearance, shelf-life). Post-harvest handling vital as cultivation for top-tier results, maximized returns.
II. Multi-Stage Post-Harvest Processes Harvested plant to finished product journey: critical stages, each with unique parameters, equipment, quality impact.
A. Drying Initial, crucial step: preserve harvest, prevent degradation.
* Methods & Equipment:
   * Hang Drying: Whole plants/large branches hung upside down, controlled environment, lines/wire hangers.
   * Rack/Tray Drying: Cut branches/buds on perforated drying trays/mesh racks; for larger quantities/specific trimming workflows.
* Environmental Targets & Control ("Dry Room"):
   * Managed for optimal temperature, humidity, airflow.
   * Equipment: Fans, dehumidifiers, AC units, potential heaters (HVAC systems).
   * Temperature: Cooler (60-70°F or 15-21°C) preferred; slows terpene/cannabinoid degradation.
   * Humidity: Moderate RH (45-55%) targeted. High risks mold; low causes rapid drying.
   * Airflow: Gentle, indirect; removes moisture, prevents mold. Strong, direct causes rapid, uneven drying.
* Impact on Quality & Drying Time:
   * Optimal (Slow & Controlled): Maintained target environmental parameters. Best preserves terpenes (aroma/flavor) & cannabinoids; smoother, higher-quality product. Time: 7-14 in-game days (influenced by bud density/room conditions).
   * Suboptimal:
      * Too Fast (Low RH, High Temp/Airflow): Harshness, delicate terpene loss, buds dry outside/wet inside.
      * Too Slow (High RH, Low Airflow): High mold/mildew risk (ruins harvest). Hay-like smells (improper chlorophyll breakdown).
* Progression:
   * Early Game: Basic, manually controlled room/converted grow tent; simple fans/dehumidifiers.
   * Mid-Late Game: Dedicated, insulated "Dry Rooms"; advanced, automated HVAC, environmental controllers, data logging. Links to "Environment," "Construction" skill trees.
   * "Controlled Drying Processes" node ("Harvest" skill tree) unlocks understanding, better equipment.
B. Curing Follows drying. Essential for final bouquet, flavor, smoking characteristics.
* Mechanics: Appropriately dried buds into controlled-atmosphere containers: slow moisture equalization, breakdown undesirable compounds (chlorophyll), preserve/enhance desirable ones.
* Containers & Equipment:
   * Early Game/Small Scale: Glass Mason Jars.
   * Mid Scale: Larger food-grade plastic buckets, airtight lids (e.g., Gamma Seal Lids).
   * Late Game/Industrial Scale: Specialized stainless steel curing vessels, large totes, entire climate-controlled curing rooms.
   * Accessories: Humidity Control Packs (e.g., Boveda-style) for specific RH; Small Digital Hygrometers inside containers (monitor RH).
* Environmental Stability & Parameters:
   * Storage: Cool, dark, stable environment (prevents light/temp degradation).
   * Target RH (container interior): 58-62%.
* Curing Profiles & "Burping":
   * Standard Cure: Regular container opening ("burping") - short periods (e.g., daily first week, then less) - releases excess moisture, exchanges air. Duration: 2 weeks to months.
   * Extended Cures: Longer periods for smoothness/complexity. Require exceptionally stable conditions; risk over-drying if mismanaged.
   * Strain-Specific Curing: Game may model strains benefiting from slightly different curing RH/durations, discoverable via experimentation.
* Monitoring & Automation:
   * Manual: Player uses hygrometers, manually burps, assesses by feel/smell.
   * Automated (Late-Game): "Smart" curing containers (integrated RH sensors, automated micro-venting); Climate-controlled curing rooms (precise ambient RH management around semi-permeable containers).
* Progression: "Harvest" skill tree, "Curing Sci. & App." node: unlocks knowledge, techniques, better equipment/automation.
C. Trimming Removing excess leaves from dried flowers. Improves appearance, smokability, potency concentration.
* Options & Trade-offs:
   * Manual Hand-Trimming:
      * Equipment: Trim scissors (micro-tip, curved/straight).
      * Process: Meticulous cutting sugar/fan leaves. "Wet" (pre-drying) or "Dry" (post-drying – quality preferred).
      * Pros: Highest quality product, best appearance ("bag appeal"), max trichome preservation. Careful separation high-quality trim for other uses.
      * Cons: Extremely slow, labor-intensive.
      * Unlocks: "Trimming & Preparation" skill node.
   * Semi-Automated Trimming:
      * Equipment: Manual/electric "bowl trimmers."
      * Process: Buds tumbled over grates with cutting blades.
      * Pros: Significantly faster, reduces labor.
      * Cons: Rougher on buds, some trichome loss, less manicured appearance. Lower quality trim.
   * Fully Automated Trimming:
      * Equipment: Industrial-scale automated trimming machines.
      * Process: Large machines (tumblers, blades, vacuum systems) process large quantities quickly.
      * Pros: Highest speed, lowest labor cost/unit (very large volumes).
      * Cons: Highest initial equipment cost. Most aggressive; significant trichome loss, more processed appearance. For biomass (extraction) or lower-grade flower.
      * Unlocks: Late-game "Post-Harvest Efficiency (Bulk Processing & Basic Auto.)" skill node.
* Kief Collection: During dry trimming (esp. kief screen trim bins), players collect fallen trichomes (kief: valuable, potent byproduct). Automated trimmers may also have collection systems.
D. Advanced Extraction Techniques (Post-MVP or Significant Late-Game) Creating concentrates (oils, shatter, wax, isolates). Major post-harvest expansion. Asset List: "Potential Future/High Tier".
* Specialized Equipment:
   * Solventless: Rosin presses (heat, pressure).
   * Solvent-Based (Abstracted System):
      * Extraction Vessels: Wash material with solvent (e.g., ethanol, CO2 – mechanics abstracted).

* Multi-Step Processes & Optimizable Parameters:
   * Material Prep: Specific grind consistency, decarboxylation (THCA to THC via heat), flash-freezing.
   * Extraction Run: Parameters (solvent type, temp, pressure, soak/flow time) affect yield/profile.
   * Winterization/Dewaxing (some extracts): Crude extract at low temps in solvent precipitates fats/waxes, then filtered.
   * Solvent Recovery/Purging: Evaporate/recover solvent (often under vacuum) for safe/clean product.
   * Distillation (high purity): Separate cannabinoids by boiling points for potent distillates.
   * Post-Processing: Whipping, agitating, temp manipulations for desired consistencies (badder, crumble, sauce).
* Quality Factors: Each step's parameters influence concentrate yield, purity, potency, flavor (terpene retention), consistency.
* Progression: Dedicated "Extraction Science" / "Advanced Processing" branch ("Science" skill tree) or new skill tree. Requires significant investment: specialized lab equipment, dedicated facility space (potential safety features e.g., solvent ventilation), advanced knowledge.
E. Edible & Topical Production (Further Post-MVP or Significant Late-Game) Transforming flower/extracts to consumable/applicable products.
* Specialized Equipment:
   * Kitchen: Commercial-grade mixers, ovens, stovetops, double boilers.
   * Infusion: For infusing fats (butter, oils) with cannabinoids.
   * Homogenizers: Ensure even cannabinoid distribution.
   * Molds: Gummies, chocolates, etc.
   * Filling/Depositing Machines: Accurate dosing/filling.
   * QC Tools: (Simulated) lab testing for batch potency.

* Packaging Lines: Specific equipment for individual edible units (wrappers, child-proof containers) or topicals (jars, tubes).
* Progression: Dedicated "Product Formulation," "Culinary Science," or "Pharmaceutical Compounding" skill tree branch. Investment: food-grade facilities, advanced QA/QC equipment.
III. Designing Packaging Processes Preparing final product for simulated sale, distribution, long-term storage.
* Core Steps:
   * Weighing: Accurate product weighing (flower, concentrates, edibles) via tiered digital scales (pocket to bench).
   * Containerization: Product into primary packaging:
      * Flower: Mylar bags, glass jars, pre-roll tubes.
      * Concentrates: Small glass/silicone containers, vape cartridges.
      * Edibles/Topicals: Specific wrappers, pouches, jars, tubes.
   * Sealing (freshness, anti-contamination):
      * Heat sealers (Mylar bags).
      * Vacuum sealers (long-term storage/certain packaging).
      * Lid applicators (jars/containers).
   * Labeling:
      * Content: Strain/Product name, Company branding, Batch number/Harvest date, Potency (THC, CBD % - from in-game lab testing), Net weight. Potential other simulated compliance info.

* Progression & Unlocks: Packaging equipment/automation via "Business" skill tree (market presentation, efficiency, scaling sales) or "Processing & Logistics" branch ("Harvest"/new skill tree).
IV. Managing Post-Harvest Perishability & Quality Degradation Cannabis: agricultural product; quality degrades if not handled/stored correctly. Time-sensitive post-harvest operations emphasized.
* Core Principle: Time, temperature, light, oxygen, humidity are primary quality enemies. Minimizing negative exposure key.
* Time-Sensitive Urgency & Workflows:
   * Immediate Post-Harvest: Freshly harvested plants vulnerable (mold, rapid degradation). Prompt move to drying environment critical; delays severely impact product.
   * Drying: Stable/optimal environmental conditions paramount. Fluctuations/rushing: significant quality loss (terpenes, cannabinoids, smoothness).
   * Curing: Environment consistency, proper burping schedules essential. Mistakes (missed burping, unstable temps) can ruin harvest (mold, hay-smells).
   * Long-Term Storage: Properly dried/cured cannabis in airtight containers (Mylar bags, vacuum-sealed bags, glass jars with good seals) in cool, dark, stable environment. Oxygen absorbers optional for very long-term. Light, heat, fluctuating humidity, oxygen degrade cannabinoids/terpenes over time.
* Strategies to Minimize Degradation:
   * Efficient Facility Layout: Logical flow (harvest -> dry -> trim/cure -> storage) minimizes travel time/exposure.
   * Batch Management & Tracking: In-game system: label/track batches through stages. Prevents mishandling, forgetting, out-of-sequence processing.
   * Dedicated Environmental Controls: Advanced HVAC/environmental systems (unlocked via progression) in drying, curing, storage rooms for precise/stable conditions.
   * Inventory Management (FIFO): Encouraged/subtly enforced for sales (older stock may degrade, incentivizing selling first).
* Feedback Mechanisms for Quality Degradation:
   * Visual Cues: Mold, color changes (browning), reduced trichome vibrancy.
   * Data/Testing: (Simulated) lab tests show gradual cannabinoid/terpene decrease or terpene profile shift (poor/long storage).
   * Market Value / NPC Feedback: Degraded products: significantly lower prices. NPCs: specific feedback ("stale," "potency lower").
V. Conclusion Processing & Post-Harvest Mechanics: deep, integral Project Chimera gameplay. Techniques range (manual/artisanal to industrial/automated), allowing diverse playstyles/strategic choices. Detailed management (drying, curing, trimming, potential extraction/edibles) + perishability realities challenge players to master entire product lifecycle, not just cultivation. Final stage success crucial for maximizing quality/value, closing seed-to-sale loop rewardingly/realistically.
