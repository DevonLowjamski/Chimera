Scope Management, Phasing, and Risk Mitigation Plan v1.1
I. Introduction Project Chimera: Scope management, phased development, risk mitigation strategy. Goal: Successful delivery, high-quality, deep, engaging core MVP experience at initial launch. Plan: Roadmap for future expansions/features; enables sustainable development, iterative improvement (technical feasibility, resource allocation, player feedback). Tenet: Manage complexity, retain depth.
II. Feature Prioritization & MVP Definition Ambitious multi-genre design necessitates rigorous feature prioritization for focused, achievable MVP. A. Core Pillars for MVP (Must-Have for Initial Launch): Complete, satisfying core gameplay loop. * Cultivation Simulation: * Detailed plant lifecycle: planting seeds/clones, transplanting, basic plant training (topping, manual LST). * Environmental Control: Manual adjustment, basic automation (light timers, simple thermostat/humidistat for basic HVAC) for temperature, humidity, light cycles. * Nutrient Management: Manual mixing basic nutrient recipes, application, medium EC/pH monitoring (handheld meters). * Plant Health: Basic visual indicators, few common pests/diseases, manual treatment (neem oil spray). * Genetics & Basic Breeding: * Simplified inheritance model for core key traits (primary cannabinoid potential [THC/CBD], basic yield factor, flowering time, rudimentary morphology). * Sexual reproduction: Identify male/female plants, manual pollination for F1 seeds. * Basic Cloning: Cuttings from mother plants for genetic preservation. * Phenotype Observation: Player selection via visual characteristics, basic post-harvest metrics. * Facility Construction & Management (Initial Scale - "Residential House" Map): * Grid-based interior room construction (walls, doors). * Essential cultivation equipment placement: basic tier grow lights, fans, pots/containers, basic irrigation (watering cans, simple reservoirs + pumps for manual/timed watering). * Basic abstracted utility connections (power draw). * Post-Harvest Processing (Basic): * Drying: Manual hanging/rack in designated (player-built) dry space; environment impacts time/quality. * Curing: Manual container curing (jars), manual "burping". * Trimming: Manual hand-trimming. * Economy (NPC-Driven): * NPC-issued cultivation contracts (specific strain/quantity/quality). * Direct sales to limited NPC buyers. * Basic operational cost management: utilities, consumables (nutrients, medium, seeds), initial equipment. * Player Progression (Core Loop): * Initial Skill Tree branches: core cultivation, basic genetics, facility operation. * Unlock new equipment tiers, basic techniques via achievements, skill points. * Narrative guidance (AI Advisor ADA), initial objectives to Warehouse map unlock (major milestone). * Data, UI, & Feedback Systems (Essential): * Core environmental data dashboards (real-time sensor readouts). * Plant status UI panels (essential health/growth info). * Basic logs & notes (player observations, key automated event logging). * Essential alert system (critical environmental deviations, plant health issues). B. Features Simplified/Deferred (Post-MVP/Later Phases): For manageable MVP scope. * Advanced Breeding Systems: Complex polygenic traits, genetic marker analysis, advanced tissue culture, genetic modification (CRISPR-like) simplified for MVP (focus: observable traits, simple inheritance); significantly expanded post-launch. * Player-Driven Marketplace: Deferred entirely post-MVP (per "Game Concept 1.3"). MVP uses NPC economy only. * Advanced Automation & Robotics: Complex late-game systems (robotic potting, automated harvesting, advanced conveyors) deferred to late-game MVP stages or post-MVP. Basic automation (timers, simple controllers) in MVP. * Advanced Extraction & Product Formulation: Oils, concentrates, isolates, edibles, topicals deferred post-MVP. Asset List confirms "Extraction/Concentrate Equipment... post-MVP". * Complex Physics Models: Highly detailed fluid dynamics, computational airflow use abstracted, performant MVP models (see VI.A). * Multi-Region Gameplay & Advanced Exterior World Simulation: MVP: core facility maps (Residential House, basic Warehouse access) in "white abyss". Dynamic regions, climates, detailed exteriors post-MVP (per "Construction & Facility Management Design 1.1"). * Deep Narrative & Complex NPCs: MVP: functional ADA, basic NPC contract givers. Deeper characters, storylines, NPC relationships post-MVP. * AI Research Lab (breeding prediction): Advanced tool deferred to late-game or post-MVP genetics expansion.
III. Refining Scope & Phased Development Plan Phased approach: Iterative development, risk management, incorporate learnings.
● Phase 0: Pre-Production & Prototyping (Completed/Ongoing): Core design docs, visual style guides, technical planning. High-risk system prototyping: abstracted environmental physics, basic procedural plant generation, core UI interactions.
● Phase 1: Vertical Slice & Core Loop Validation: Objective: Implement/test core loop (planting, basic env. management, growth, harvest, basic drying/curing, rudimentary NPC sale). Establish core performance benchmarks. Key Systems: Basic plant growth model (visual stages, light/water/nutrient response), simplified env. factors, placeholder critical data UI. Outcome: Playable, demonstrable vertical slice validating fun, technical feasibility.
● Phase 2: MVP Development (Iterative Sprints): Objective: Build full MVP feature set; iterative development, integration.
○ Sprint Structure (Illustrative):
■ Mod 1: Cultivation & Environment: Detailed plant lifecycle, nutrient system, pest/disease first pass, basic HVAC/sensor integration, env. dashboard V1.

■ Mod 5+: Content Expansion, Polish & Balancing: More strains, equipment tiers, UI/UX refinement (internal testing), progression balancing (Skill Tree, research), initial tutorial, optimization.
○ Methodology: Agile sprints; regular internal playtesting, reviews, continuous integration.
● Phase 3: Alpha & Beta Testing:
○ Alpha: Feature-complete MVP. Focus: internal QA, bug fixing, performance optimization, initial balancing.
○ Closed Beta: Controlled external testing (limited players) for gameplay, usability, balance, stability feedback.
○ Open Beta (Optional): Broader stress testing, final feedback pre-launch.
● Phase 4: MVP Launch & Initial Post-Launch Support: Release polished MVP. Focus: critical bug fixes, server stability (if any, player market deferred), immediate player feedback.
● Phase 5: Post-MVP Expansions & Live Service (Long-Term): Develop deferred features, new content (MVP success, player feedback, roadmap). Examples: Player-Driven Marketplace, Advanced Genetics & Research, Industrial Operations & Automation, New Maps/Narrative.
IV. Re-evaluating the AR Component Original: AR "search/find" for rare genetics (landraces). Re-evaluated. Assessment: Cost/Benefit: AR dev complex, resource-intensive, platform-dependent, high testing overhead. Benefit to core simulation questionable vs. cost/risk. Can feel gimmicky if not deeply integrated. Tech/Design Challenges: GPS accuracy, variable environments, privacy, AR engagement with PC sim. Game Concept 1.3 Decision: Explicit "AR removal" for focused core cultivation/genetics development. Alternative In-Game Mechanics for Rare Genetic Acquisition: * NPC-Sponsored Expeditions/Research Grants: Player resource/time investment in abstracted expeditions; chance for rare landrace seeds. Success may depend on research/equipment. * High-Tier NPC Contacts & Faction Reputation: High rep with specific NPCs (remote collectives, universities, seed banks) unlocks exclusive heirloom/landrace genetics. * Lore-Driven Discovery & "Lost Strain" Quests: Clues (journals, records, dialogue) to multi-stage "rediscovery". * Specialist NPC Vendors/Collectors: Rare genetics via unique, high-priced NPCs or challenging contract rewards. Final Decision: Defer AR Indefinitely. Focus on robust, immersive, thematic in-game rare genetic acquisition. Aligns with "Game Concept 1.3"; reduces MVP scope risk.
V. Managing Complexity Balancing Challenge: Deep, realistic systems that are engaging, understandable, strategically meaningful, not impenetrable/tedious. Balance "Realism Bias" with playability. Strategies: * Progressive Disclosure: Gradual system introduction. Simpler versions early; complexity/advanced options via Skill Tree, research, upgrades. * Clear & Intuitive UI/UX: Per "Data, UI, and Feedback Systems" doc: effective data viz, tooltips, alerts, organized UI for comprehension. * AI Advisor (ADA) Guidance: Contextual explanations, important info highlights, non-intrusive tips. * Integrated Tutorial & Guides: In-game tutorial (fundamentals). "Plant Problems Guide" (Asset List), help menus for concepts, issues, solutions. * "Earned Automation" Philosophy: Manual tasks feasible small-scale; shows "Burden of Consistency" with scale/time. Makes automation desirable, rewarding progression (per "Balancing Manual Tasks vs. Automation 1.1"), not punishment. * Meaningful Strategic Choices: Complexity yields interesting decisions, clear cause-effect, learnable, not overwhelming micromanagement. * Continuous Playtesting & Iteration: Regular internal/external testing identifies excessive complexity, confusion, tedium. Systems refined via feedback. * Strategic Abstraction: Hyper-realism with overwhelming complexity for minimal gameplay benefit (e.g., precise nutrient chemistry, light quantum physics) abstracted to believable, manageable level.
VI. Addressing Technical Risks Proactively Early risk ID/mitigation key for smooth development. A. Complex Physics Model Performance (HVAC/Airflow, Irrigation): * Risk: Full fluid dynamics/CFD computationally prohibitive. * Mitigation: Abstracted Physics Models ("Technical & Systemic Implementation"): zone-based influences, periodic updates, simplified flow logic. Early Prototyping & Profiling: Develop/stress-test abstracted systems early (baselines, bottlenecks). Scalability Testing: Ensure performance with facility/equipment increase. Continuous algorithm/data structure optimization. B. Player-Driven Economy Stability (Post-MVP Risk): * Risk: Inflation, exploits, duplication, manipulation destabilizing economy. * Mitigation (future, planned): Robust Resource/Currency Sinks from marketplace dev start (taxes, fees, NPC services, repair costs) per "Economy & Marketplace Systems". Balance resource generation ("faucets") vs. oversupply. Market Monitoring & Analytics Tools for health tracking, anomaly detection. Extensive Closed Beta Testing of marketplace pre-release (patch exploits). C. Procedural Plant Generation Quality & Performance: * Risk: Visually diverse, high-quality plants reflecting genetics/environment, performant with many instances. * Mitigation: Modular and Artist-Controlled Procedural System ("Technical & Systemic Implementation"). Human artists create base assets, textures, rules; AI assists variety. Strict Performance Budgets (poly counts, draw calls, texture memory), aggressive LODs for procedural plants. Extensive Visual & Performance Testing (wide genetic/environmental range). D. AI-Assisted Asset Pipeline Integrity & Legal Compliance: * Risk: Immature AI tools, inconsistent style, legal/ethical copyright issues, inefficient PBR integration. * Mitigation: Mandatory Human Artist Optimization and Oversight for ALL AI-assisted assets ("Technical & Systemic Implementation"). Rigorous Provenance Tracking (tool, prompts, human mods). AI tools Strategically/Selectively (ideation, base gen, sub-tasks), not artist replacement. Strict Visual Style Guide adherence (human review). Stay informed on Evolving Legal/Ethical Landscape (AI content); respect tool licenses.
VII. Securing Realism Data & Knowledge Base Accurate, verifiable info crucial for authenticity, "Realism Bias" alignment. Process for Sourcing/Validating Data: * Public-Domain Knowledge Foundation: Initial base from reputable public sources: peer-reviewed papers (plant physiology, cannabis science), university ag extension pubs, horticultural texts, respected cultivation guides. * Expert Consultation (Considered, Budget/Availability Dependant): Possible consultation (botanists, horticulturalists, geneticists, experienced legal cultivators - NDA) to validate assumptions, gather insights, review abstracted models' plausibility. * Cross-Referencing/Consensus: Info cross-referenced from multiple credible sources for scientific consensus, differentiate from anecdotal/speculative. * Focus on Established Scientific Principles: Simulation prioritizes modeling on well-understood biological/chemical processes. GxE (Genotype x Environment) Interaction Modeling: * Identify key environmental factors (light spectrum/intensity, temp, humidity, VPD, CO2, nutrient availability/deficiency/toxicity, water stress) & impacts on cannabis morphology, growth, health, secondary metabolites. * Develop simplified, believable mathematical/logical models for GxE responses (observable outcomes, not deep molecular simulation). Genetic Trait Data: Define core heritable traits (cannabinoid ratios, terpene profiles, yield potential, flowering time, structure, pest/disease resistance). Plausible ranges, simplified inheritance (dominant/recessive, abstracted polygenic) from cannabis genetics literature. Iterative Refinement & In-Game Documentation: "Realism data" subject to ongoing review/refinement (testing, feedback, new science). Key validated info to players via in-game guides ("Plant Problems Guide"), ADA explanations.
VIII. Conclusion Plan: Strategic framework for Project Chimera dev. Aims for sustainable, successful cycle: well-defined MVP (core features), deferring higher-risk/non-essential, proactive technical/complexity challenge addressing. Crucial for deep, engaging, authentic cannabis cultivation/genetics sim: iterative development, rigorous testing, accurate realism data, strategic AI tools (human oversight). Structured approach: strong launch, solid foundation for future growth/evolution.
